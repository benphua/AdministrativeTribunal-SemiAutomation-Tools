"1","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0033 Heard at the Sheffield Magistrates Court On 7-10 October 2019 Representation: Appellant: Mr Lockley (Counsel) First Respondent: Ms Kelsey (Counsel) Second Respondent: In person Before JUDGE SOPHIE BUCKLEY DAVE SIVERS PAUL TAYLOR Between WESTMINSTER CITY COUNCIL Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and GAVIN CHAIT Second Respondent DECISION 11. For the reasons set out below the tribunal allows the appeal against decision notice FS50681283 and issues the following substitute decision notice. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: Westminster City Council Complainant: Gavin Chait The Substitute Decision 1. For the reasons set out below the Public Authority was entitled to refuse the Complainant’s requests for information made on 30 March 2017 on the grounds that the requested information was exempt from disclosure under s 31(1)(a), s 41, s 14, and, in relation to any of the disputed information relating to sole traders or partnerships, under s 40(2) FOIA. Action Required 2. No action is required. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50681283 of 25 January 2018 which held that Westminster City Council (‘Westminster’) was not entitled to rely on s 31(1)(a) (prejudice to the prevention or detection of crime) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). The Commissioner held that s 31(1)(a) was engaged but that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the public interest in maintaining the exemption. 2. This appeal was heard along with the appeal number EA/2018/0055, an appeal by Sheffield City Council (‘Sheffield’) arising out of an identical request by Mr Chait. The tribunal has issued separate decisions but much of the content is the same. 3. Where reference is made to ‘the council’ or ‘the councils’ this should be read as referring to both Westminster and Sheffield. Factual background to the appeal 4. Mr Chait is an economic development researcher at an open data research, training and consulting company, Whythawk. The company is, inter alia, studying the diversity of economic development opportunities across England and Wales, mapping the revenue potential of active commercial property for all business types. 5. Councils bill and collect national non-domestic rates (NNDR) from all occupiers of non-residential premises. Rates due from empty properties are 2collected from the person entitled to possession. There are a variety of exemptions and reliefs available. The level of NNDR administered by Westminster is higher than any other local authority. In 2017/2018 the overall value of NNDR handled by Westminster was £2.2 billion, which amounts to 8% of the NNDR collected nationally. 6. The Council administers NNDR refunds, which arise, for example, when a business moves or because of a reduction in the rateable value of a property. Westminster issues about 9000 refunds a year totalling approximately £165 million, with individual refunds often in excess of £1 million. 7. The request is for information related to NNDR charged to businesses in the Council’s area. 8. The Valuation Office Agency (‘VOA’) is an executive agency of HMRC. In relation to NNDR, one of its functions is to compile and maintain lists detailing the rateable value (‘RV’) of each non-domestic rateable property (also known as a hereditament) in England and Wales. Rateable properties can be occupied or vacant, but have to be appropriate for occupation. The rateable value forms the basis for NNDR bills issued by local billing authorities. As part of the valuation process, each rateable property is assigned a category code, which might, for example, identify it as a warehouse. 9. The VOA is subject to statutory provisions which cover the confidentiality of information held by the VOA, when it is lawful to disclose that information and the legal sanctions for wrongful disclosure. The VOA is not permitted to disclose information except in certain limited circumstances, including, for the purposes of its functions, where there is a legislative gateway or with customer consent. 10. Within those constraints the VOA publishes certain information on its website including the billing authority reference code and the full property address. Request and Decision Notice 11. Mr Chait made the request which is the subject of this appeal on 30 March 2017: In terms of the Freedom of Information Act of 2000, and subject to section 40(2) on excluding personal data, could you please provide me with a complete and up-to-date list of all business (non-residential) property rates data for your local authority, and including the following fields: - Billing Authority Reference Code (linking the property to the VOA database reference) - Firm’s Trading Name (i.e. property occupant) - Full Property Address (Number, Street, Postal Code, Town) - Occupied/Vacant 3- Date of occupation/Vacancy - Actual annual rates charged (in pounds) If you are unable to provide an absolute “Occupation/Vacancy“ status, please provide the Exemptions and/or Reliefs that a particular property may be receiving. 12. Mr Chait had requested the same information on 14 March 2016. Westminster refused the 2016 request relying on s 31(1)(a). Mr Chait requested an internal review on 26 April 2016 and Westminster upheld its decision on 25 May 2016. 13. Westminster replied to the 2017 request on 21 April 2017, confirming that it held information within the scope of the request but refusing to provide the information relying on s 31(1)(a) FOIA. No internal review was requested or carried out. 14. Mr Chait complained to the Commissioner on 8 May 2017. 15. In a decision notice dated 25 January 2018 the Commissioner concluded that s 31(1)(a) was engaged. Westminster argued that disclosure of the information would directly provide an opportunity for fraudulent NNDR refunds. The Commissioner accepted that Mr Chait had shown that information was already publicly available in relation to many properties but concluded that a larger list of properties would be available if the information were disclosed. The Commissioner determined that this was a prejudice likely to affect the prevention of crime. Weighing the factors in favour of the exemption being maintained against the public interest in disclosure, she concluded that the balance of public interest rests in the disclosure of the information. Grounds of Appeal 16. In summary the grounds are that the Commissioner was wrong to conclude that the public interest favoured disclosure (Ground 1) and that Westminster wishes to rely on additional exemptions: s 21 (information in the public domain) (Ground 2); s40(2) (third-party personal data) in relation to any sole traders or partners (Ground 3); s 14 (vexatious request) on the basis that Westminster estimates that deciding which exemptions apply would take at least 123 hours (Ground 4). 17. In particular, in relation to ground 1, the appellant submits that the Commissioner: 17.1. Failed to give due weight to the increased risk of fraud to Westminster which she accepted would be the result of disclosure; 17.2. Gave undue weight to the fact that other local authorities have disclosed similar information and/or failed to give due weight to the unique circumstances of Westminster; 17.3. Failed to give any weight at all to the distinct prejudice that would arise from disclosing the locations of empty properties. 418. Westminster acknowledges in its grounds of appeal that some of the information is already in the public domain and states that it is in the process of providing Billing Authority reference codes and full property addresses to the Mr Chait. The Commissioner’s response 19. The Commissioner’s response states: Ground 1 (public interest balance) 20. Westminster has not explained why other Councils have been able to release this data without cause of concern. It seems unlikely that the fact that the amount of public money at risk was lower would lead authorities to release the data. There is insufficient evidence of a risk of crime in empty properties. Ground 2 (s 21) 21. Westminster has not indicated where the information can be obtained. It is unclear if Westminster asserts that all the information is reasonably accessible. Ground 3 (s 40(2)) 22. This is misconceived. The request was made subject to s 40(2). Ground 4 (s 14) 23. In principle the cost of complying may make a request vexatious, but Westminster need to provide further explanation of time and cost. Mr Chait’s response Section 31 is not engaged 24. Evidence shows that disclosure of ratepayer and vacancy data does not prejudice the prevention of crime. There is no evidence that vacant property crime occurs at a rate substantially higher then expected in Westminster. North Wales Police have provided data on incidents in empty commercial premises which shows that a vacant property is less likely to experience crime. 25. Data provided by Thames Valley police (a) shows that crime in vacant properties is so low as to not be a meaningful risk and (b) does not demonstrate a causal link between the publishing of data by authorities and crime in empty commercial properties. 526. More than 65% of authorities publish periodic updates on commercial vacancy data to their open data websites and 93% overall provide vacancy data. 27. The cost of collating, cleaning and cost-referencing empty property data provided by local authorities to provide a statistical database is disproportionately large compared to the potential gains from empty property crime such as metal theft. 28. Authorities rely on hyperbole – for example Liverpool Council claimed that disclosure leads to ‘use, possibly by overseas companies, to dump waste’. The data can not be used in that way. It does not include anything about a property’s size, access, buildings, parking areas or unbuilt space. Properties rated by the VOA are required to be ready for immediate commercial occupation and use and therefore unlikely to be the sites used for illegal dumping. 29. There is no evidence in support of Westminster’s claims that empty properties lead to a risk of terrorism. 30. It is already possible in less than an hour to gather the requested data related to a specific commercial property, which could be used for fraudulent purposes. A sufficiently motivated individual would not be prevented by the lack of data published by Westminster. 31. The requested data are not part of Westminster’s fraud risk assessment. There is no request for the ratepayer customer number, the credit value due to each ratepayer or any information on revaluation of the property. In order to process a rebate an appointed agent would need information not covered by the request. City of London refund to the person who made the payment and make refunds without application. Their incidence of fraud is nil. The evidence of the Detective Chief Inspector carries little weight. 32. Squatting and fraud are low frequency events. 33. Data released by public authorities on empty properties can be and is used to assist authorities in identifying companies fraudulently claiming tax relief. 34. The empty buildings likely to be of interest to urban explorers are unlikely to be on the master ratings list, because those buildings are ready for occupation by a tenant. The VOA database already provides plenty of information which would be of greater use to potential urban explorers. There is a mass of existing public data already offering almost unlimited ability to identity explorable places. Ratepayer data would not offer anything new. The public interest favours disclosure 635. Data is needed to inform action to be taken to tackle empty commercial properties. The government recognises the value of commercial vacancy data. 36. The data produced by Whythawk can be or it used to support economic development, access to housing, assessment of energy use, the investigation of money laundering and fraud and to inform the setting of business rates. Summary 37. Westminster have not shown a causal relationship between disclosure and any prejudice. Mr Chait’s evidence shows that: 37.1. Vacant properties are at a lower risk of crime than occupied properties, ratepayer publication is used in the investigation of fraud, and that vacant properties have no relevance to terrorism. 37.2. Any prejudice is not real and is insubstantial. 37.3. There is no clear or causal link between disclosure and criminal activity. 37.4. Those wishing to commit rates-related fraud against specific ratepayers can do so with data in the public domain. 37.5. Westminster does not use the requested data in its fraud prevention systems and a significant risk is caused by their systems of themselves. Further written submissions 38. The tribunal took account of all further written submissions provided by the parties, but they will not be summarised here. The scope of the appeal 39. Westminster are no longer relying on s 21 and have disclosed the property codes and the addresses. Four parts of the request are still in issue: the name of the business, whether occupied or vacant, the date of occupation or vacancy and the actual rates charged, and if unable to provide an absolute occupied or vacant status the exemptions or reliefs that a particular property may be receiving. 40. At the hearing all parties proceeded on the basis that all other parts of the requests were within the scope of this appeal and we also proceed on this basis. 41. During the hearing Westminster were permitted to rely on s 12 and s 41 as additional exemptions. Legal framework S 31 – law enforcement 742. S 31 FOIA provides a qualified exemption subject to the public interest test in respect of information relevant to specific areas of law enforcement: S 31 - law enforcement (1) Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 [investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities] is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice- (a) the prevention and detection of crime, (b) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, (c) the administration of justice, (d) the assessment or collection of any tax or duty or of any imposition of a similar nature, (e) The operation of the immigration controls, (f) The maintenance of security and good order in prisons or in other institutions where persons are lawfully detained, (g) The exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (h) Any civil proceedings which are brought by or on behalf of a public authority and arise out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment, or (i) Any inquiry held under the Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc (Scotland) Act 2016 to the extent that the inquiry arises out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment. … 43. The exemption is prejudice based. ‘Would or would be likely to’ means that the prejudice is more probable than not or that there is a real and significant risk of prejudice. The public authority must show that there is some causative link between the potential disclosure and the prejudice and that the prejudice is real, actual or of substance. The harm must relate to the interests protected by the exemption. S 41 – information provided in confidence 44. S 41 provides, so far as relevant: S 41 – Information provided in confidence (1) Information is exempt information if – (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person. 845. Sections 31(a) and (d) and s 41 are qualified exemptions and therefore if either section is engaged, the tribunal must consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information. S 40 – personal Information 46. The relevant parts of s 40 of FOIA provide: (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if- (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is- (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a)-(d) of the definition of ‘data’ in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles... … (5) The duty to confirm or deny— … (b) does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 191)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles... 47. Personal data is defined in s1(1) Data Protection Act 1998 (‘DPA’) (this request predates the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation “GDPR”) as: data which relate to a living individual who can be identified – (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller. 48. The first data protection principle is the one of relevance in this appeal. This provides that: 1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless - (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met...” (See para.1 Sch 1 DPA). 49. The only potentially relevant condition in Schedule 2 DPA is section 6(1) which provides that the disclosure is: necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the 9processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.’ (See para. s 6 Sch. 2 DPA) 50. The case law on section 6(1) has established that it requires the following three questions to be answered: 1. Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? 2. Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? 3. Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? 51. The definition of ""personal data"" consists of two limbs: i) Whether the data in question ""relate to"" a living individual and ii) Whether the individual is identifiable from those data. 52. The tribunal is assisted in identifying ‘personal data’ by the cases of Ittadieh v Cheyne Gardens Ltd [2017] EWCA Civ 121; Durant v FSA [2003] EWCA Civ 1746 and Edem v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA Civ 92, from which the following principles are drawn. 53. In terms of ‘identifiability’, personal data covers, for example, the name of a person in conjunction with his telephone details or information about his working conditions or hobbies, as well as information that a person has been injured and is on half time, or his name and address. 54. In Durant, Auld LJ, giving the leading judgment said at [28]: Mere mention of the data subject in a document held by a data controller does not necessarily amount to his personal data. Whether it does so in any particular instance depends on where it falls in a continuum of relevance or proximity to the data subject as distinct, say, from transactions or matters in which he may have been involved to a greater or lesser degree. It seems to me that there are two notions that may be of assistance. The first is whether the information is biographical in a significant sense, that is, going beyond the recording of the putative data subject's involvement in a matter or an event that has no personal connotations, a life event in respect of which his privacy could not be said to be compromised. The second is one of focus. The information should have the putative data subject as its focus rather than some other person with whom he may have been involved or some transaction or event in which he may have figured or have had an interest, for example, as in this case, an investigation into some other person's or body's conduct that he may have instigated. In short, it is information that affects his privacy, whether in his personal or family life, business or professional capacity. 55. In Edem Moses LJ held that it was not necessary to apply the notions of biographical significance where the information was plainly concerned with or 10obviously about the individual, approving the following statement in the Information Commissioner's Guidance: It is important to remember that it is not always necessary to consider 'biographical significance' to determine whether data is personal data. In many cases data may be personal data simply because its content is such that it is 'obviously about' an individual. Alternatively, data may be personal data because it is clearly 'linked to' an individual because it is about his activities and is processed for the purpose of determining or influencing the way in which that person is treated. You need to consider 'biographical significance' only where information is not 'obviously about' an individual or clearly 'linked to' him. S 12 – cost of compliance 56. Under s 12(1) a public authority is not obliged to comply with a request for information where: the authority estimates that the costs of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit. 57. The relevant appropriate limit, prescribed by the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (‘the Regulations’) is, in this case, £450. 58. In making its estimate, a public authority may only take account the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in– (a) determining whether it holds the information, (b) locating it, or a document which may contain the information, (c) retrieving it, or a document which may contain the information, and (d) extracting it from a document containing it. (See regulation 3). 59. The Regulations specify that where costs are attributable to the time which persons are expected to spend on the above activities the costs are to be estimated at a rate of £25 per person per hour. 60. The estimate must be sensible, realistic and supported by cogent evidence (McInnery v IC and Department for Education [2015] UKUT 0047 (AAT) para 39-41). 61. A public authority cannot comply with FOIA by providing such information as it can find before section 12 applies (Reuben Kirkham v Information Commissioner [2018] UKUT 126 (AAC) (‘Reuben Kirkham’)). S 14 - vexatious request 62. Guidance on applying s 14 is given in the decisions of the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in Dransfield ([2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and [2015] EWCA 11Civ 454). The tribunal has adapted the following summary of the principles in Dransfield from the judgment of the Upper Tribunal in CP v Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 427 (AAC): 63. The Upper Tribunal held that the purpose of section 14 must be to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA (para 10). That formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal subject to the qualification that this was an aim which could only be realised if ‘the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied’ (para 72 of the CA judgment). 64. The test under section 14 is whether the request is vexatious not whether the requester is vexatious (para 19). The term ‘vexatious’ in section 14 should carry its ordinary, natural meaning within the particular statutory context of FOIA (para 24). As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may be vexatious but that is not a rule. Annoying or irritating requests are not necessarily vexatious given that one of the main purposes of FOIA is to provide citizens with a qualified right of access to official documentation and thereby a means of holding public authorities to account (para 25). The IC’s guidance that the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause was a useful starting point as long as the emphasis was on the issue of justification (or not). An important part of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of whether or not there is an adequate or proper justification for the request (para 26). 65. Four broad issues or themes were identified by the Upper Tribunal as of relevance when deciding whether a request is vexatious. These were: (a) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (b) the motive (of the requester); (c) the value or serious purpose (of the request); and (d) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). These considerations are not exhaustive and are not intended to create a formulaic check-list. 66. Guidance about the motive of the requester, the value or purpose of the request and harassment of or distress to staff is set out in paragraphs 34-39 of the Upper Tribunal’s decision. 67. As to burden, the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether the request is properly to be described as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor [para 29]. Thus, the greater the number of previous FOIA requests that the individual has made to the public authority concerned, the more likely it may be that a further request may properly be found to be vexatious. A requester who consistently submits multiple FOIA requests or associated correspondence within days of 12each other or who relentlessly bombards the public authority with email traffic is more likely to be found to have made a vexatious request [para 32]. 68. Ultimately the question was whether a request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Answering that question required a broad, holistic approach which emphasised the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there was a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests [paras 43 and 45]. 69. In the Court of Appeal in Dransfield Arden LJ gave some additional guidance in paragraph 68: ‘In my judgment the Upper Tribunal was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the request was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available...’ 70. Nothing in the above paragraph is inconsistent with the Upper Tribunal’s decision which similarly emphasised (a) the need to ensure a holistic approach was taken and (b) that the value of the request was an important but not the only factor. 71. The lack of a reasonable foundation to a request was only the starting point to an analysis which must consider all the relevant circumstances. Public interest cannot act as a ‘trump card’. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious. 72. In relation to whether or not a request could be vexatious because of the cost of compliance the Court of Appeal stated: 1385. As the UT held, there is no warrant for reading section 14 FOIA as subject to some express or implied qualification that a request cannot be vexatious in part because of , or solely because of, the costs of complying with the current request. 86. In addition I would agree with the UT's observation that, if the authority can easily show that the limits in section 12 would be exceeded, it would be less complicated for it to rely on that section, rather than section 14. 73. In Home Office v Information Commissioner and Cruelty Free International [2019] UKUT 299 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal stated: The issue is always whether the resources required to provide the information, and therefore the requests to the authority, were such as to render the request vexatious. And that will depend on the context. It would, for example, take a much higher burden to render vexatious a request pursuing allegations of ministerial corruption than a request asking for the number of paperclips used in the minister’s private office. 74. In the same case the Upper Tribunal stated, at para 21, that although there are other provisions, such as s 12, that allow burden to be addressed, those other provisions do not deal with every eventuality. The Task of the Tribunal 75. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Issues 76. The issues we have to determine were agreed by the parties as follows: Section 31(1)(a) 1. If the disputed information, or any part of it, were released, would it prejudice, or be likely to prejudice, the prevention of crime? 2. If so, does the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweigh the public interest in disclosing it? Section 41 5. Is any of the disputed information confidential within the meaning of s.41(1) FOIA? 146. For any information which is confidential, would disclosure be in the public interest such that it would not amount to an actionable breach of confidence? Personal Data 7. is any of the disputed information personal data, insofar as it relates to a. Sole traders; and/or b. Partnerships. 8. If so, should the Requests be construed as either: a. Excluding any personal data, or alternatively b. Including personal data, subject to the application of the exemption at s.40(2) FOIA? 9. To the extent that any of the information in the scope of the Requests amounts to personal data, would the release of that information breach the First Data Protection Principle, in that its release would be unfair to the data subject? Section 12/14 (Westminster only) 10. Would the costs of disaggregating personal data from non-personal data fall within the costs that may be included within an estimate of the cost of responding to the Request, for the purposes of s.12, as defined by reg. 4(3) of the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limits and Fees) Regulations 2004? 11. If so: a. has Westminster produced a reasonable estimate of those costs; and b. on that estimate, do the costs exceed the appropriate limit? Evidence and submissions 77. We have read an open and a closed bundle of documents, which we have taken account of where relevant. 78. We read statements from and heard oral evidence from Mr Hinkley, Assistant City Treasurer – Revenues and Benefits on behalf of Westminster, and, on behalf of Sheffield, from Mr Harrow, Solicitor with responsibility for NNDR advice and recovery at Sheffield, Mr Foster, Capita team leader in the NNDR 15team dealing with collection of business rates on behalf of Sheffield, and Mr Exley, Group Manager in Structural and Public Safety for Sheffield. 79. All witnesses were cross-examined by the Commissioner and Mr Chait. Mr Chait did not give oral evidence but confirmed that any evidence contained in his submissions or in the bundle was true to the best of his knowledge and belief. Mr Chait was not cross-examined by the Councils or the Commissioner on the basis that this would not be taken as accepting the truth of all Mr Chait’s evidence. 80. All parties submitted skeleton arguments or equivalent and made oral submissions, including a very short closed submission by Westminster, a gist of which was given to the excluded parties. The tribunal took account of the content of all submissions where relevant. Discussion and conclusions Section 31(1)(a): If the disputed information, or any part of it, were released, would it prejudice, or be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime and if so, does the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweigh the public interest in disclosing it? 81. As the first-tier tribunal in Hogan Oxford City Council and the Information Commissioner (EA/2005/0026, EA/2005/0030) observed at para 27, where the specified activity or interest which would be likely to be prejudiced is a public interest, like the prevention of crime, there is an obvious overlap between whether or not the section is engaged and any subsequent application of the public interest test. Thus, in this appeal there is significant overlap in the evidence and submissions on the first two issues. We have therefore combined our consideration of the evidence and submissions of the first two issues, but we bear in mind that although the relevant factors may overlap, the questions that we have to answer are different. 82. The applicable interest in this case is the prevention of crime. It is important to note that s 31(1)(a) is engaged where there would be likely to be prejudice to the prevention of crime. It does not require the respondent to show that disclosure will lead to an increase in crime. 83. The nature of the prejudice being claimed by Westminster is to the prevention of three different types of crime: (i) fraud (ii) terrorism and (iii) a broad spectrum of crimes broadly falling under the heading of property crime. 84. When deciding if the section is engaged, we must decide if the Council has satisfied the evidential burden of showing that some causal relationship exists between the prejudice being claimed and the potential disclosure; if the prejudice is real, actual or substantial; and whether the chance of prejudice is 16more than a hypothetical or remote possibility i.e. is there a real and significant risk of prejudice? Provision of ‘out of date’ data 85. Mr Chait submitted that much of the risk of crime could be avoided while still satisfying the public interest in the use of the data by researchers by the provision of ‘out of date’ data, with a time lag so it was no longer live. This is not what was requested and therefore not something we can take into account. The relevance of the statistics on squatting, crime, fraud etc 86. We accept the Council’s submissions that the statistics produced by Mr Chait do not assist us in resolving the issues before us. For example, the fraud statistics appear to show a general increase in the number of business frauds, but it is impossible to draw any relevant inferences from this. The statistics on squatting relate only to residential property and therefore are not helpful. 87. The other crime statistics are relied on by Mr Chait to demonstrate that the release of equivalent data by other public authorities has not led to an increase in crime, which would be expected if the Council’s fears are justified. We do not accept that we can draw any such inference from the statistics or indeed any inferences which assist us in resolving the issues before us. 88. Mr Chait provided details of information recorded by two police authorities on crime in vacant properties. Only Thames Valley Police and North Wales Police record this information. It is a snapshot rather than a ‘before and after disclosure’ comparison and is therefore of limited use. Thames Valley Police provides some data for Oxford and Reading, one of which discloses the information and one which does not, but this does not take account of many other potential differences between Oxford and Reading and we do not accept that we are able to infer anything about whether disclosure has or has not made a difference. 89. Taken at their highest, the statistics show that in the Thames Valley and North Wales police authorities, crime is much more likely to occur in occupied properties than in unoccupied properties. That is unsurprising and does not assist us in resolving the issues in this appeal. 90. Mr Chait also produced a graph showing crime rates more generally over the period during which there was a dramatic increase in the number of authorities publishing the requested information. He submitted that this showed that there had not been the increase in crime which would be expected if the Councils were right. 1791. The graph shows the change in recorded rates of four particular types of crime between July 2013 and March 2019: shoplifting, criminal damage and arson, robbery and burglary. Shoplifting is included as a comparator. Robbery is not likely to occur in vacant properties by definition. The statistics on burglary relate to ‘business and community’ which is undefined but is not limited to vacant properties. Criminal damage and arson are the most relevant crimes, but the statistics are not limited to vacant properties. 92. It is unclear to us whether any increase in crime caused by the release of the information in other authorities would show on this graph, particularly if Mr Chait is right that crime is much more likely to occur in occupied than unoccupied properties. We note that the chart shows a slight increase in criminal damage and arson post-publication by most authorities, but we do not think this is significant given that the statistics are not limited to vacant properties and given the potentially unlimited and unknown other variables which could have caused the rise. 93. Overall, we do not find these statistics helpful in determining the issues before us: the question that we have to answer is not whether the Councils have shown that the release of information would lead to an increase in crime, but whether release would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime. The relevance of disclosure by most other public authorities 94. Both Mr Chait and the Commissioner ask us to place weight on the fact that the majority of local authorities publish the information requested. Save for the issue of the statistical evidence or lack of it as to the effect of this publication dealt with above, what is the relevance of this factor to the issues we have to determine? 95. The Commissioner submits that we should infer that either the authorities or the Commissioner considered either that disclosure would not prejudice the prevention of crime or that the negative consequences of disclosure were outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. She submits that it is not reasonable to infer that the authorities simply failed to consider whether or not disclosure would prejudice the prevention of crime. 96. We accept that it is reasonable to infer that most authorities would have considered the issue, even if some might not have done. We accept that it is reasonable to infer that the Commissioner or most of the other local authorities concluded, on the basis of facts and reasoning that we are not aware of, that there was either no prejudice or that any negative consequences were outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. 97. How does this assist us in determining the issues before us? The Commissioner urges us to treat this as ‘highly suggestive’ of there not being significant 18prejudice arising from disclosure. We do not accept that the conclusions of other local authorities made on the basis of facts and reasoning unknown to us are of any assistance in deciding whether or not prejudice would be likely to arise from disclosure by Sheffield or Westminster. 98. For similar reasons, we place little weight on the factual conclusions of other first tier tribunals that have considered similar issues: we do not have the same evidence before us. Information already in the public domain: property crimes and fraud. 99. Mr Chait makes two separate points under this heading. First, that a decision has been made to publish details on, for example, the planning portal which carries the same if not greater risk of misuse and second that any criminal wishing to locate a vacant property for the purposes of crime has access to plethora of other sources of information already in the public domain. 100. In relation to the publication of similar information on the planning portal, we do not accept that this is relevant to the issues we have to determine. Parliament has decided, for understandable reasons, that certain information should be made public in an arena where decisions will have a likely impact on neighbours and/or the wider community. We assume that some assessment of risks and benefits was undertaken before such a decision was made, but it does not assist us in determining the issue before us. 101. We note that the VOA database, which does publish certain information, does not contain the more specific ratepayer data which is covered by the request. Again, we assume that some assessment of risks and benefits was undertaken, but it does not assist us in determining the issue before us. 102. Finally, we note that businesses in the BID (‘Business Improvement District’) in the centre of Sheffield produce a list of vacant commercial properties. Here again, we presume that the owners of the properties undertook some assessment of risks and benefits before taking the decision to make these details public, but it does not help us in determining this appeal. 103. In terms of the submission that any criminal wishing to locate a vacant property/use rates data for the purposes of crime can already do so, Mr Chait produced evidence that showed that much of the requested information could be obtained by a wrongdoer in relation to a particular hereditament in approximately 10-25 minutes. We accept that evidence. We note however that not all the information was discoverable: for example, Mr Chait had to estimate the date of vacancy. We accept that an educated guess as to the properties potentially due a refund could be made with the information published on the VOA, which would give a potential fraudster a starting point, but not as much as a confirmed figure issued by the Council. 19104. In relation to property crimes we accept that the planning portal, Google Street View and other sources already allow criminals to identify targets, and that the list is not likely to contribute to opportunistic crimes, but we accept the submission by Sheffield that the provision of a readymade list makes it easier to commit crime and therefore prejudices the prevention of crime: it enables criminals to avoid the significant effort of researching and compiling the information in relation to each potential target. 105. It would take a significant period of time to assemble a list equivalent to that requested: for a list of 40,000 hereditaments Mr Chait estimates that it would take 515 days of continuous work and this list would still not contain all the requested detail. 106. We accept that disclosure of this information is not likely to prejudice the prevention of opportunistic property crime. Further we accept that it is possible to identify many vacant properties from outside and others are generally known to be vacant. However, we accept that it is much easier to use a ready-made list than comb through the planning portal, or use Google Street View to assess the whole of Sheffield or Westminster or scan marketing websites. Although a potential criminal can piece something similar together with enough time, effort and motivation, that does not answer the point that the criminal’s life is made easier through the provision of a ready-made list. The claimed prejudice: fraud 107. Westminster argued that there is a significant risk of serious prejudice to the prevention of crime in two ways: first, with the disputed information a malefactor could bypass the security systems and convince Westminster that they were the ratepayer given that they use the requested data as part of their security checks; second, by analysing the data a malefactor could work out which properties were due a refund – giving a readymade way of prioritising a fraud target. 108. The level of NNDR administered by Westminster is higher than any other local authority. In 2017/2018 the overall value of NNDR handled by Westminster was £2.2 billion, which amounts to 8% of the NNDR collected nationally. 109. Westminster administers NNDR refunds, which arise, for example, when a business moves or because of a reduction in the rateable value of a property. It issues about 9000 refunds a year totalling approximately £165 million, with individual refunds often in excess of £1 million. 110. The system Westminster has adopted to limit fraudulent claims for NNDR refunds is to verify the identity of anyone seeking a refund by asking a series of questions in a telephone call. We accept Mr Hinkley’s evidence that the 20disputed data would allow a person to answer some of the security questions in the current pool. Different questions are asked each time, and so this would allow someone to bypass the systems sometimes, but not always. 111. It is true that Westminster could remove these particular questions from the pool, but we accept that reducing the size of the pool of questions makes a system less secure. Further we accept that adding new questions is not straightforward given the limited datasets that Westminster collects: they do not for example have access to identifiers like national insurance numbers or dates of birth. Creating a new security system, or collecting further information would incur costs and cause inconvenience. The relevance of the fact that the Council could alter its security systems 112. The Commissioner and the Councils submitted that for the purposes of considering whether or not the section is engaged we have to take the Council as we find them and disregard the fact that the prejudice to the prevention of crime could be avoided by taking some of the steps outlined above. Mr Chait disagreed, submitting that the fact that the systems could be changed, avoiding an increased risk of fraud, meant that the section was not engaged. 113. Mr Lockley drew an analogy with the s 12 authorities where an authority’s systems must be taken as they are: it is not for the tribunal to judge the adequacy of Westminster’s systems: the question is, given that Westminster has the system they have, would the prejudice arise? 114. The Commissioner submitted that the potential for altering the system became relevant at the stage of considering the public interest. 115. In our view the starting point in relation to whether or not s 31 is engaged is that we should look at the circumstances as they existed at the relevant time and ask ourselves whether or not there is a significant risk of prejudice to the prevention of fraud given the Council’s security systems at that time. We do not think that it is an answer to say that there would be no risk if they adopted a different system. 116. When looking at the balance of public interest we accept that the ease with which the risks of prejudice to the prevention of fraud could be mitigated are relevant to the weight to be attached to this risk. If the risk of fraud could be easily and quickly mitigated at no cost to the authority, this risk might attract relatively little weight in the balance. If it could only be mitigated at significant cost and effort, it would attract more weight. In this case we accept that it is not straightforward to simply create new questions, and that creating an entirely different security system would entail significant time and expense. The claimed prejudice: terrorism 21117. Westminster, along with City of London, is the prime target for terrorist activity in the United Kingdom. Westminster rely on an email from DCI Boon (Head of Serious Acquisitive Crime Investigation for Westminster Police), received by Westminster on 8 September 2010 which states in relation to terrorism that: I have been asked to look at into the harm likely to be caused by releasing specific details of the vacant properties owned by Westminster Council. … From the police perspective there is a real risk of crime should this detail be released… Most importantly Westminster is also a unique borough, a centre of world attention and, unfortunately, sometimes hate. Releasing this information would potentially provide terrorists with vulnerable key locations from which to conduct or focus their activities. If a terrorist atrocity is being planned, Westminster as a centre of government, tourism, culture and commerce is an extremely likely target. 118. The Commissioner submitted that Mr Hinkley was not entitled to simply do what the police advise him to do: this is not what is required by FOIA. The authority can seek advice but cannot replace its own assessment under FOIA with that of a police officer. That is undoubtably right, but we are not here to review the public authority’s decision-making process. 119. In an ideal world, we would hear oral evidence from a police officer in relation to this specific request. Failing that, we would have a recent signed witness statement dealing with the specifics of this request. In reality, the police have limited resources and other priorities. Mr Hinkley gave evidence that he had requested updated advice, but had received no reply. 120. Whatever the practical difficulties of obtaining ‘better’ evidence, we would have placed more weight on the evidence of DCI Boon if the email had been written in 2017, or if we had been provided with a signed witness statement, or if DCI Boon had attended the tribunal to give evidence and been subject to cross-examination, or if we had the precise details of the request he had been asked to consider, or if the evidence had related to this request in particular. 121. However, aside from a broad assertion from Miss Kelsey that things might have changed since 2010, there was no suggestion that things had changed in relation to terrorism since 2010 in any relevantly significant way, for example in the way terrorists operate or in terms of any reduced risk in Westminster. Mr Hinkley, although not an expert in terrorism, gave evidence that the severity of risk in Westminster had not reduced since 2010. 122. Mr Hinkley was ‘99% certain’ that DCI Boon was considering a similar request. Although we do not have the precise details of the terms of the request that DCI Boon was considering, we find that ‘specific details of the vacant 22properties owned by Westminster Council’ is sufficiently similar that we can infer that DCI Boon would have given the same opinion in relation to the request in this appeal. 123. Therefore, although we place reduced weight on this evidence for the reasons outlined above, we do place weight on the opinion of a senior police officer in this borough, and we accept that the release of details of vacant properties would potentially provide terrorists with vulnerable key locations from which to conduct or focus their activities. We do not think it is appropriate to infer that the risk arising from empty properties is not significant simply because it is not mentioned in the various documents produced by Mr Chait: just because it is not mentioned does not mean that it is not a risk. Even in Westminster, terrorism is a low probability event, but carries with it a risk of serious harm. We find that this makes it a real and significant risk such that it engages 31(1)(a). Given the limitations in the evidence we find that, despite the risk of serious harm, it carries only a moderate amount of weight in the public interest balance. The claimed prejudice: property crimes 124. Under this heading we consider all the other crimes or issues associated with criminal behaviour in empty properties relied on by the Councils. 125. Squatting in non-residential properties is not a crime, but is often associated with criminal offences such as criminal damage and anti-social behaviour offences. 126. Westminster relied on evidence in the form of a letter dated 13 April 2011 to the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Borough Council from Chief Superintendent Dave Musker from the Metropolitan Police. The Chief Superintendent gives his opinion that the release of information on vacant properties in Wandsworth would or would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime. He states: …properties left empty can become prone to being at the centre of crime and disorder issues, namely crack houses, meeting places for young people and anti-social behaviour by those squatting. There is also a growing trend of vacant commercial premises being used by those squatting… Disclosure of a list of this nature would make it considerably easier for organisers of these events to identify new locations to hold them. 127. This letter from 2011 is supplemented by another email provided by Wandsworth which is dated 16 June 2017 and is to Merton Council from Peter Laverick, also from the Metropolitan Police, in which he fully endorses the 2011 letter and states: I have spoken to three Neighbourhood Inspectors on the borough. They have brought to my attention several unoccupied non-residential premises in Wandsworth which 23have been linked to crime and disorder…One address in particular has been used for unlicensed social events and the consumption of alcohol and has been frequented by a number of individuals with criminal convictions. This has caused considerable concern to local residents. My fear is that if we were to disclose the number and location of unoccupied non- residential premises in the borough, this would lead to further incidents of crime and disorder – including illegal squatters, anti-social behaviour, drug consumption and unlicensed social events - and prejudice our efforts to prevent and investigate crime. 128. Westminster also relied on an email from DCI Boon (Head of Serious Acquisitive Crime Investigation for Westminster Police) , received by Westminster on 8 September 2010 which states that: I have been asked to look at into the harm likely to be caused by releasing specific details of the vacant properties owned by Westminster Council. … From the police perspective there is a real risk of crime should this detail be released….speaking from my specific area of expertise, which is burglary, there is a risk these premises could be targeted. Even though vacant, fixtures, fittings and raw materials can be stolen form them. Theft of lead, copper and other materials have all occurred in Westminster recently for example. I have conducted quick checks on our databases and in the last two months alone there were 6 burglaries of vacant premises…. Other offences such as Arson and Fraud have also been recorded in relation to vacant premises on Westminster…There is a likelihood that social networking sites could share this information to arrange unlawful raves. In addition, from my policing experience in general. I have seen vacant properties used as crack houses. Therefore, I believe your concern around anti-social behaviour and drugs to be valid. 129. As set out above in relation to terrorism, we were urged to place little weight on the police evidence by the Commissioner and Mr Chait. We refer back to our observations above in relation to DCI Boon’s evidence, and add that Ms Kelsey is correct to submit that DCI Boon’s evidence would have carried more weight if he had contacted other authorities which did disclose this information and asked them if they had seen any increase in crime in empty commercial properties. However, we do place weight on this evidence, again for the reasons set out above. 130. In relation to the other police evidence, we repeat our points about ‘better evidence’ and note also that these emails do not relate to Westminster and that one dates from 2011. 131. Despite these limitations, we do place weight on the opinion of Commander David Musker, endorsed more recently by Peter Laverick from the Metropolitan Police. If the situation had changed in any relevant or significant way since 2011, we assume that Mr Laverick would not have ‘fully endorsed’ Commander Musker’s email. Those emails show that, in the opinion of the 24Metropolitan Police, based on examples of crime related to empty properties, the release of a list of unoccupied non-residential premises would lead to further incidents of crime and disorder in Wandsworth. Wandsworth is not a dissimilar borough to Westminster and we infer that similar risks would exist in Westminster, particularly in the light of the similar concerns expressed by DCI Boon. 132. Mr Chait made the point that Wandsworth now release this data. We do not know why this decision was made by Wandsworth, and we do not think that this makes any difference to the weight we place on the police evidence. We deal with the relevance of the decisions of other public authorities elsewhere in this decision. 133. We were referred to the evidence heard by the first-tier tribunal in Voyias and the conclusions that the tribunal reached on the basis of that evidence. That evidence was not before us and we do not place any weight on the factual findings of that tribunal. 134. Overall, we accept, on the basis of the evidence of police opinion, that the release of the requested information is likely to make the commission of these crimes easier and therefore that s 31(1)(a) is engaged. Because of the fact that many of these crimes will be opportunistic, and because of the limitations of the evidence discussed above, we place less weight on this prejudice in the public interest balance than in relation to the other crimes relied on by Westminster. Conclusions 135. For the reasons set out above, we find that section 31(1)(a) is engaged. We find that there is a real and significant risk that fraud would be made easier by the release of this list; that the release of details of vacant properties would potentially provide terrorists with vulnerable key locations from which to conduct or focus their activities; and that the provision of a readymade list of empty properties makes it easier for criminals to identify targets for the crimes grouped under the heading ‘property crimes’ above. We find that the release of the list would therefore be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime. 136. Turning to the public interest, taking into account our discussions and conclusions set out above, we find that there is a very significant public interest in maintaining the exemption. In relation to terrorism although this is, by its nature, a low probability event, the potential consequences of an act of terrorism are extremely serious. In DCI Boon’s opinion, terrorists might be able to exploit the information in Westminster. We therefore give this prejudice moderate but still significant weight in the balance. 25137. In relation to fraud, we accept that the release of this information would make it much easier for a fraudster to pose as a ratepayer and bypass the Council’s security systems, and that changing those systems would entail significant time and expense. Further that it would facilitate a fraudster posing as the Council to obtain confidential information from a ratepayer. There is evidence that rates fraud is a real and current problem. The consequences to the Council of a loss of a significant sum of public money are serious. We therefore give this prejudice very significant weight in the balance. 138. In terms of the remaining group of property crimes, including squatting, we place some limited additional weight on this prejudice for the reasons set out above. 139. Taking all these matters together, including in particular the prejudice to the prevention of rates fraud and terrorism, we find that there is a very significant public interest in maintaining the exemption. The public interest in release of the information 140. Mr Chait argues that there is a lack of public data in this area, and that it is needed for the purposes of research. He argues that there is strong public interest in proper research relating to current concerns about empty commercial properties, particularly on the high street, claims that business failures are due to business rates, and the impact or potential impact of steps to tackle this including potentially discounting business rates. Without this disclosure Mr Chait argues that there is no data available to interrogate these claims or evaluate interventions. He highlights a number of specific issues which we deal with below. Use by charity tax commission 141. Mr Chait referred us to a report by the Charity Tax Commission (CTC) dated July 2019 entitled ‘Reforming charity taxation, towards a stronger civil society’ which makes a number of recommendations intended to make charitable tax reliefs, including business rates relief, more effective in achieving their ends. The report states that there are areas where it cannot propose immediate solutions because of a lack of adequate data and robust research that would allow the CTC to understand the consequences of various possible changes (p 8). One of its main recommendations is headed ‘improved data and openness’. This section describes a need for better government data because knowing how tax reliefs are distributed is important for understanding how far they influence public and charity behaviour and deliver their intended objectives. The report states that ‘it is currently difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy where most charitable tax reliefs are targeted or the public benefit they support. The related recommendation is mainly focussed on the publication of government statistics but the CTC does also recommend that 26‘Local authorities should also publish their business rates registers as open data in a standardised format’ (p 10). 142. At p 31 of the report, the CTC states that ‘the data for business rates relief are less comprehensive owing to a lack of publicly available and accessible information.’ The CTC then uses data made available by 18 local authorities to examine the characteristics of a sample of charities that have received mandatory business rates relief and make observations on the distribution of business rates relief. The CTC states at p 43 ‘Our research into the distribution of business rates relief was similarly disadvantaged by the lack of available and consistent machine-readable data… This meant that we only had a relatively small sample of data to analyse…’ recommending at p 44 that ‘local authorities should publish their business rates registers as open data, to a standardised format, using charity and company numbers collected during the application process’ and noting later that ‘to be truly useful open data need to be both machine-readable and consistent in format’ and at p 639 ‘Our own research into the distribution of business rates relief across the charitable sector is limited by the lack of open, machine-readable data for analysis’. 143. The fact that the CTC complains of a lack of sufficient useable data in July 2019, despite the number of local authorities now publishing information in response to Mr Chait’s request, suggests that the public interest in the availability of data usable by organisations such as the CTC will not be served by another ad hoc release of data in a potentially inconsistent format. As the chart on p 4 of Mr Chait’s skeleton argument shows, at the time the review was commissioned, over 200 local authorities self-published the requested information along with over 100 publishing in response to his requests. Despite this the CTC were only able to use data from 18 local authorities. What the CTC identified as lacking was the publishing of business rates registers by all local authorities in a standardised machine-readable format. That is not what Mr Chait has requested, nor what he is achieving by his many individual freedom of information requests and it will not be achieved by the release of the data in this appeal. 144. We do accept that the CTC report shows that some use can be made of non- standardised data on business rates released by individual authorities on an ad hoc basis (see the use of the data made available by the 18 local authorities) and therefore that the release of this information by these two Councils might add something to similar research in the future. However, the evidence of Mr Harrow and Mr Hinkley was that this information could be made available directly to the CTC on request subject to appropriate safeguards, such as an information sharing agreement, providing an alternative route to achieve the same aim. The availability of this option significantly dulls the public interest in ordering release to the public at large. 27Use of the information by researchers 145. It is accepted by the Councils that researchers, including Mr Chait, can use this data to contribute usefully to the general debate in this area and therefore there is some public interest in its release. The usefulness of data released by an individual council in response to an FOI request is reduced for the same reasons set out in relation to the CTC above, i.e. ad hoc release by different Councils of different information in different formats has its limitations. 146. It is clear from, for example, the report on ‘meanwhile use’ by Centre for London (Meanwhile, in London: Making use of London’s empty spaces), that researchers can use data produced by Mr Chait using the requested data from other authorities to undertake research which could facilitate economic development and Mr Chait gave further examples of researchers who were looking to undertake research using his data in diverse areas such as energy use. 147. However, it is clear that this research can be and is being undertaken without the data from Sheffield or Westminster. Although there is some evidence that researchers complain of a lack of data in this area, it is open to researchers to approach either council to enter into licensed research agreements to obtain the same data, and therefore there are other routes to satisfy this interest without releasing the data to the world at large with associated risk of misuse. Use of information by businesses looking for opportunities 148. We accept that a list of vacant commercial properties could be used by businesses looking for development opportunities. However, there are already sources of information which can be used to identify these opportunities: in addition to those vacant properties which are being actively marketed, there is a list of vacant commercial properties on the BID list and information is available from the Council itself including, in Sheffield, from the town centre management scheme or planning officers. Use of information by local authorities 149. Mr Chait referred us to a summary of responses to a Business Rates Avoidance consultation published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in July 2015. In response to question 8 (‘Do you have any views on what steps could be taken to help authorities come together to tackle attempted business rates avoidance?’) the DCLG records that: The majority of respondents suggested that a centralised information sharing portal where local authorities could share experiences and solutions would be helpful and provide more consistency to the way they tackle avoidance…Some identified the need for two-way data and information sharing between local 28authorities, the VOA and other public bodies to help strengthen attempts to tackle avoidance. 150. Mr Chait put to Mr Hinkley that this document specifically stated that data sharing would be helpful, but as Mr Hinkley stated in evidence, it is referring to data sharing between authorities and not with the public. 151. The data requested could be used by other local authorities in their attempts to reduce avoidance schemes: Mr Harrow’s witness statement sets out the use he makes of data released by other authorities and Mr Hinkley accepted that a national database would be of use in identifying potential business rates fraud. However, Mr Hinkley and Mr Harrow both gave evidence that steps were being taken to set up a shared data portal where this information could be shared between local authorities without release to the the public. Whilst this had not been set up at the time the request was made, we accept that the fact that the process is in motion reduces the public interest in the release of the information on this ground: a more appropriate channel is in the process of being created. This is in accordance with the views of local authorities expressed in the DCLG consultation set out above. Conclusions on the public interest in disclosure 152. We accept that there is some public interest in disclosure, but we conclude that this interest is limited for the reasons detailed above, principally that these matters can and do take place without the data, and that where this data is helpful this public interest can be satisfied by obtaining it or equivalent information through other channels without the risks attendant on publication to the world. We conclude that this limited public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the very significant public interest in maintaining the exemption. Section 41 Is any of the disputed information confidential within the meaning of s.41(1) FOIA? 153. We accept Mr Knight’s submissions that there is a general common law principle of tax payer confidentiality: see R (Ingenious Media Holdings plc and another) v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2016] UKSC 54 (‘Ingenious Media’) at para 17: ‘where information of a personal or confidential nature is obtained or received in the exercise of a legal power or in furtherance of a public duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the person from who it was received or to who it relates not to use it for other purposes.’ 154. We do not think that the very short consideration of a similar issue by the first-tier tribunal in London Borough of Ealing v Information Commissioner EA/2016/0013 assists us in determining whether or not the disputed information in this appeal is confidential. 29155. We accept that the statutory bar on disclosure that applies to the VOA assists us in determining whether or not the disputed information is of the type that is protected by the law of confidence. Sections 63A and 63B of the Local Government and Finance Act 1988 (‘LGFA’) allow disclosure of revenue and customs information in certain circumstances in the business rates arena. Any further disclosure is not allowed under s 63A. This reflects s 18 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which was held by the Supreme Court in Ingenious Media to stem from the general common law principle referred to above. It does not apply directly to the Local Authority, but we accept Mr Knight’s submission that it not only explains why the VOA publishes what it does, but also strongly suggests, by analogy, that the disputed information is covered by s 41. 156. We were provided in the hearing with a copy of Sheffield’s small business rates relief application form. It transpired after the hearing that we had been provided with a different version to that in use at the relevant time, and we were provided with the 2017 version after the hearing. Both forms include statements under the relevant data protection legislation in force at the time about how personal data will be used and who it will be shared with. This is of limited assistance in determining whether or not the disputed data (which is not always personal data) has the necessary quality of confidence, however we find that there is nothing in these statements that is inconsistent with the information being confidential. We accept that information provided to a local authority for the purposes of calculating rates or reliefs is information that a reasonable person would regard as confidential. 157. We accept that it is relevant to consider whether the disputed information is already in the public domain, but given the difficulty of finding most of the disputed information we do not accept that it is generally accessible such that it cannot be regarded as confidential. 158. For these reasons we accept that the disputed information carries the necessary obligation of confidence. For any information which is confidential, would disclosure be in the public interest such that it would not amount to an actionable breach of confidence? 159. Even if information is confidential, s 41 only applies where disclosure would be an actionable breach of confidence. We must therefore apply something akin to the public interest test and ask if there is some public interest in disclosure which outweighs the interest in the protection of confidence. 160. For the reasons set out in our consideration of the public interest balance in relation to s31(1)(a) above we have concluded that there is only a limited 30public interest in disclosure of this information, and consequently we conclude that there is insufficient public interest in disclosure to outweigh the importance of the general common law principle of taxpayer confidentiality. 161. We find that s 41 applies to the whole request. We accept Mr Knight’s submission that dataset 2 should not be looked at in isolation but in the context of the whole request: the tax payer’s identity is used in conjunction with the rest of the information to calculate the level of taxation and therefore we accept that the whole of the disputed information is exempt under s 41. S 40 – personal data Is any of the disputed information personal data, insofar as it relates to Sole traders and/or partnerships? 162. Applying the usual tests, we conclude that any of the disputed information that relates to sole traders and/or partnerships is personal data. Mr Chait argues that trading names and addresses are not personal data. We disagree: the information relates to a living individual and the individual is identifiable from those data. The information links to an identifiable individual and reveals something meaningful about their life, even though it is their professional life. Taken together all the information has an individual as its focus where it concerns a sole trader or partnership. 163. Mr Chait argues that he has only asked for trading names, but we accept Mr Knight’s submission that as the request asks for the property occupier, this would identify the individual ratepayer where this was a sole trader or partnership. Should the requests be construed as excluding any personal data, or including personal data subject to the application of the exemption at s 40(2)? 164. Mr Chait did not express a clear view as to which of these meanings he intended: he knows that there is ‘supposed to be a s 40 redaction’ and he just cut and pasted a template for the wording. 165. Looked at objectively, we think that the request is unambiguous. The phrase ‘subject to s 40(2) on excluding personal data’ must mean that only data excluded in accordance with 40(2) should be excluded. It is difficult to see how it could be objectively construed as excluding all personal data, given the express reference to s 40(2). We construe the request as including personal data, subject to the application of the exemption at s 40(2). To the extent that any of the information in the scope of the Requests amounts to personal data, would the release of that information breach the First Data Protection Principle, in that its release would be unfair to the data subject? 31166. Mr Chait argues that trading names and addresses of sole traders and partnerships are already published in a number of places, including on the Companies House website, on the VOA, in the phone book, on SatNavs, on commercial drivers’ licences and on the outside of company premises. 167. It is true that the information requested in these sections of the request, taken alone, is available in the public domain from a number of sources. However, in our view it is artificial to consider each element of the request separately. This is not a request for a list of the names and addresses of businesses within the local authority. The request is, in terms, for a ‘list of all business (non- residential) property rates data’. The fields which follow are simply a list of fields that should be included. The specified rates data is only useful if it is provided with the name and address of the company and the names and addresses are only useful when provided with the specified rates data. 168. The rates data is only personal information because it is provided in conjunction with the identifying information of name and/or address. We must therefore look at whether or not release of the requested list as a whole, rather than of each individual item on the list, would be unfair. 169. We accept that Mr Chait is pursuing a legitimate interest, but we do not accept that disclosure is necessary to pursue that interest for the reasons set out in considering the public interest in disclosure under s 31(1)(a) above. 170. Unless the Councils expressly stated that they would publish personal data held for the purposes of the assessment and collection of business rates, we find that there would be a legitimate expectation that personal information held by the Council for these purposes would be used only for those purposes and not generally published. In reaching this conclusion we take account of the general principle of taxpayer confidentiality discussed above. 171. We find that release of this data would expose the individuals in question to the risks identified when considering s 31 above. It would increase the risk of crime in relation to that individual’s property if it was empty, and would increase the risk of business rates fraud against that individual. 172. We infer that knowledge of this increased risk would lead to distress for the individuals. The fact that some individuals might choose to place details of their empty business properties on the BID list, or on a estate agents marketing website does not alter this conclusion. In those circumstances they took the decision to publish voluntarily with the knowledge of the risks and benefits to their business and could take appropriate precautions. The fact that they are not caused distress by publishing in these circumstances does not mean that they would not be distressed by the Local Authority, without their consent, releasing their personal data which includes details of their empty properties (where relevant) with attendant risks to security and rates data which would 32assist a fraudster to bypass security checks, in circumstances where they were obliged to provide the data to the Local Authority for the express purposes of assessing business rates or reliefs. 173. Taking account all the above, we conclude that although Mr Chait is pursuing a legitimate interest, the release of the data is not necessary for the purposes of those interests and, in any event, the processing is unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. Section 12/14 (Westminster only) 174. Having concluded that personal data falls within the scope of the request, the costs of disaggregating personal data from non-personal data do not fall within the costs that may be included within an estimate of the cost of responding to the request. We therefore consider whether or not the request is vexatious by reason of those costs. We were provided with a closed bundle and Westminster made a short closed submission in relation to this issue. 175. The gist of the closed session that was provided to Mr Chait and Sheffield is as follows: The Tribunal looked at the closed material, which is a sample of 50 rows from the NNDR database. Mr Lockley explained and the Tribunal satisfied itself that what was shown in the final column was the precise date that the property was occupied from/ vacant. Mr Lockley illustrated the estimate that 160 entries could be reviewed per hour at 2.25 seconds per entry by reference to particular examples, including some instances where he demonstrated by reference to the closed material that it would take a bit more thought to establish if the ratepayer was or was not a sole trader. This gives a total of 23 hours. 176. Mr Hinkley gave evidence to explain the time it would take to redact information which was exempt under s 40(2). There are 37,000 properties on the Council’s NNDR database. Prior to 2013 the entries were not automatically divided into corporate ratepayers and sole traders/partnerships. In 2013 the system was changed, and in relation to any ratepayers registered since 2013 the user who entered the data indicates if the ratepayer was a separate legal entity such as a limited company. When the system was changed Westminster used a piece of software to identify whether pre-existing entries related to limited or non-limited companies. 177. The Council has manually reviewed a sample of 250 pre-2013 entries marked as being a limited company and 250 pre-2013 entries marked as containing personal information to determine the accuracy of the classification of the entries. The review showed that 2% of the 250 marked as limited companies were incorrect and 3% of those marked as containing personal data were incorrect. 33178. The Council submits that it would need to carry out a manual check of all pre- 2013 entries to avoid unlawfully disclosing any personal data. The Council further submits that it would have to manually check all post-2013 entries too, to identify any manual entry errors. The Council have not carried out a sample review to identify the error rate post-2013 but Mr Hinkley asserts that there will inevitably be some errors because the indication is done manually. Mr Lockley submits that this assertion is supported by the closed evidence which shows that it is not always immediately obvious from the name of the ratepayer whether or not they are a limited company or a sole trader. We note also Mr Hinkley’s evidence that the indicator that was introduced was not one that they used, because it is not a distinction that they need for normal purposes. 179. We accept that it is reasonable for the Council to manually check all its records given its evidence as to the likelihood of errors in classification in both pre- 2013 and post-2013 records because of the risks entailed in unlawfully releasing personal data. If the Council’s position was based purely on the possibility of human error due to manual input, we would not have accepted that this justified a manual check of all records. However, the closed evidence showing the potential for confusion and Mr Hinkley’s evidence of the lack of importance of this indicator to the Council both support a conclusion that there is an increased potential for error. This, combined with the presence of a significant number of pre-2013 entries (we do not have a precise number but the ‘sample’ was of 500 such entries), leads us to conclude that in these specific circumstances a full manual check is justified. We accept that the estimate of 2.25 seconds per record is a reasonable average, given that some entries will take significantly longer than this. 180. Although we are considering the matter under s 14, we accept by analogy that any flaws in the way the local authority holds the information are irrelevant (see Reuben Kirkham v Information Commissioner [2018] UKUT 126 (AAC). We do not accept the Commissioner’s submission that the failure of Westminster to ‘cleanse’ its data or establish a better system amounts to ‘deliberately distributing the information in a way which would always allow it to rely on s 12’ (see para 19 of Reuben Kirkham v Information Commissioner [2018] UKUT 126 (AAC). There is no evidence, and it was not put to Mr Hinkley, that these decisions were deliberately taken with s 12 in mind. 181. This is a case where the burden cannot be addressed by s 12 and therefore it is appropriate for it to be considered under s 14 The fact that it would take in excess of 18 hours (the limit under s 12) to carry out the necessary work does not necessarily make a request vexatious under s 14. We need to consider, in context, whether the resources required to provide the information are such as to render the request vexatious. 34182. We accept that the request is not likely to cause any harassment or distress to staff and that Mr Chait has no improper motive in pursuing the request. However, balancing the significant resource implications for the public authority against the limited public interest in the release of the information, we conclude that this is a vexatious request. Conclusion 183. For the reasons set out above the appeal is allowed. Our decision is unanimous.

Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council has disclosed a significant amount of information in the course of the appeal. There is no further information for it to disclose, with the exception of that referred to in paragraph 42. That information should be disclosed within the later of 28 days and an unsuccessful appeal to the Upper Tribunal, unless the Council informs the Tribunal within 28 days that it is claiming an exemption. NB Numbers in [square brackets] refer to the bundle 1Introduction 1. This is the appeal by Mrs Rita Palmer against the rejection by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 20 December 2018 of her complaint that Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council (the Council) had wrongly failed to disclose certain information to her under section 1(1)(b) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 2. The Tribunal added the Council as a party on 3 June 2019. The parties opted for paper determination of the appeal. The Tribunal was satisfied that it could properly determine the issues without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended). 1 Factual background 3. Mrs Palmer’s adult daughter has profound learning disabilities. Until its closure on 20 April 2018, she visited Keresforth Special Resource Centre in Barnsley (the Keresforth unit), a day facility run by the Council. The building is owned by South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SWYFT). No other day centres were suitable for her daughter, who is now in residential care. 4. There has been disagreement between the Council and SWYFT about the Council’s role in the decision to close Keresforth. The Council has claimed that the decision was SWYFT’s and that it was simply the lead provider of the service. SWYFT takes a different view. 5. Mrs Palmer is unhappy about the decision to close the centre and the process which was followed and wished to find out more; hence her FOIA request. The request and the Council’s response 6. On 3 January 2018, Mrs Palmer made the following request of the Council [32]: ‘Request for Freedom of Information. Barnsley Council meetings also meetings with SWYFT regarding closure of Keresforth resource centre, Keresforth Close, Barnsley. Minutes of any meeting regarding the closure of Keresforth, papers and any correspondence pertaining to the closure of Keresforth’. 7. The Council replied on 25 January 2018 [33]. It said that meetings with SWYFT were ‘more operational matters and cover a wide range or property issues and as such are not minuted’. It suggested Mrs Palmer contact SWYFT for a copy of its Asset Strategy. It did enclose slides from a presentation given to families by Ms Geeta Azam on 20 September 2016 during an operational day opportunities review [35]. 1 SI 2009 No 1976 28. It appears that Mrs Palmer then telephoned the Council on 30 January 2018 to ask (i) where was the report of the 20 September meeting; and (ii) what other meetings had been held. In its letter of 6 February 2018 to Mrs Palmer [41], the Council described in general terms meetings with families, carers and users during 2016 but said that no formal report was produced (it is unclear whether this was a specific reference to the 20 September 2016 meeting) and no minutes taken. The letter also referred to notes collated from all the discussions. Finally, the Council said that, once it became clear that Keresforth would close, letters were sent to each family in June and November 2017 and reviews of each user’s needs arranged. 9. Still not satisfied, Mrs Palmer requested an internal review, which the Council provided by its letter of 12 March 2018 (posted the following day) [44]. The Council noted that Mrs Palmer was in receipt of a copy of the letter sent to its Chief Executive by the Chief Executive of SWYFT on 20 December 2017 about the closure of Keresforth. The Council appeared to accept that the letter was within the scope of Mrs Palmer’s request and it later sent her another copy. It said it held no further information within scope. Proceedings before the Commissioner 10. Mrs Palmer made a complaint to the Commissioner on 15 March 2018 [46]. 11. During the course of her investigation, the Council told the Commissioner that decisions about the future of the Keresforth unit were included in SWYFT’s Trust Energy Estate Strategy 2012-2022. It reiterated that it held no relevant minutes, whether of meetings with SWYFT or Cabinet, full Council or committees (although it had not searched for minutes of meetings with SWYFT because its Corporate Asset Manager had advised that there were no records to search). Various officers had been asked whether they held information. No information had been deleted or destroyed. 12. The Council said that its duty under the Local Government Act 1972 to keep minutes only applied to the meetings of the full Council, Cabinet, regulatory boards and so forth. The Commissioner’s decision 13. The Commissioner decided that, on the balance of probabilities, the Council did not hold any further information within the scope of the request. She was influenced by the fact that it did not own the site and that it did not (so it had claimed) make the decision to close the unit. 14. The Commissioner indicated she understood why Mrs Palmer should expect the Council to hold further information, given that it ran the day service at the Keresforth unit. However, in the Commissioner’s experience, ‘the expectation of 3what may or should be held can be significantly different to what is or is required to be held, as appears to the case in this request’. The Grounds of Appeal and the Commissioner’s Response 15. In her Grounds of Appeal, Mrs Palmer said that she wanted to know who made the decision to close the Keresforth unit and why. The Council and SWYFT were each pointing the finger at the other. She queried why there were no supporting papers for meetings discussing the closure of the centre, and no correspondence either. 16. In her Response, the Commissioner maintained that her decision that no further information was held was reasonable based on the response received from the Council during her investigation – which, in light of the Tribunal’s decision in Clyne v Information Commissioner and another, 2 was the appropriate benchmark – and given that there was no evidence of an attempt to mislead Mrs Palmer and no obvious motive to withhold information. Case Management Directions (CMD) issued by the Tribunal 17. On 3 June 2019, the Tribunal issued CMD, noting that ‘[o]n the face of it, it is surprising that the Council should hold so little information in recorded form about the closure of a service of central importance to vulnerable adults’. It expressed its provisional view that any information relating to the proposed closure of Keresforth was within the scope of the request and directed the Council to address the following issues: i. What communications were there within the Council about closing the day centre and making alternative provision for attendees? If in recorded form, why have they not been disclosed? ii. Was there a financial assessment made of the pros and cons of closing the day centre and making alternative provision? iii. Which body or individual made the decision and when? iv. Were members involved in the decision? v. Was the decision minuted or otherwise recorded in writing? If so, why was the information not disclosed? vi. Mrs Palmer has obtained, it is believed following a FOIA request of the Trust shortly after her request of the Council, the minutes of various meetings of the Barnsley Strategic Estates Group between June 2016 and August 2017 [92], [99], [103] and [105]. ‘Keresforth’ was mentioned in each. Tony Taylor of the Council attended two of the meetings (and gave his apologies for the other two) and Tim Hartley, also of the Council, attended three. Does the Council regard these minutes as within the scope of the request and, if so, why have they not been disclosed given that they would presumably have been sent to Mr Taylor and Mr Hartley? 2 EA/2011/0190 at [23] 4vii. At [91] is an undated project progress report (or extract) for Sheffield City Region Public Estate Programme, again it is believed obtained by Mrs Palmer from the Trust. The report describes as a project objective ‘master-planning and feasibility work in order to bring forward the Keresforth site for future development’ and says that consideration will be given to ’new day care provision for learning difficulties’. It is understood that the Council is part of the One Public Estate Programme and may lead it. Is this report within the scope of the request and, if so, why has it not been disclosed? viii. Did the Council CEO reply to the letter of 20 December 2017 other than by a short email on 22 December 2017 [113]? The email says ‘Happy to meet if helpful’ – did a meeting take place and, if so, does the Council hold any record of it? ix. The email also refers to a joint communications plan with the Trust. Is this within the scope of the request? x. Mrs Palmer says that Geeza Azam took copious notes of the meeting with families on 20 September 2016. Are those notes within the scope of the request? Does Ms Azam work for the Council and, if not, does she hold on its behalf notes and any other information? xi. The Council’s letter of 28 November 2018 to the Commissioner [74, 75] says that plans were developed during 2015 to relocate staff and services from the site (i.e. the Keresforth Centre) with the exception of the Keresforth Support Unit (thought to be a reference to the day centre). Were similar plans in time developed for the day centre and, if so, why have they not been disclosed if in recorded form? xii. Whether the Council has undertaken any searches other than those set out in that letter 18. In response, the Council provided an undated witness statement from Ms Wendy Lowder, Executive Director-Communities and part of the Council’s Senior Management Team (SMT). Ms Lowder said that she had been inadvertently misled by colleagues when giving two of the answers to the Commissioner on 28 November 2018 [74]. A further search of Asset Management records might have revealed documents which Mrs Palmer had obtained from SWYFT. These were the minutes of the Barnsley Strategic Estates Group (BSEG) meetings held on 6 June 2016, 6 December 2016, 4 April 2017 and 1 August (?2017) attended by Mr Hartley and Mr Taylor [92], [99], [103] and [105]. 19. Ms Lowder revealed for the first time that the proposed closure had been discussed by the SMT. She also said that, where SMT records referred to an intention to submit further reports to SMT and Cabinet, that did not take place. This was because managers took the view that the decisions which needed to be made were operational, involving the detailed consideration of appropriate service provision for vulnerable individuals, rather than strategic, since the Council was not closing an asset which it owned. 20. With its Response, the Council disclosed: the Opportunities Options Appraisal Report written by Ms Azam on 24 October 2016, a report to the SMT dated 5 December 2018, extracts of SMT meetings on 5, 12 and 19 December 2017 and a report under delegated powers dated 27 April 2018 authorising relocation of 5Keresforth staff. It made a number of points, broadly corresponding to the questions raised by the CMD: • Ms Azam’s report had not previously been disclosed because it was considered confidential • SMT meetings were private and records relating to them were not routinely searched because a FOIA request would probably be met with a certificate under section 36 FOIA (disclosure prejudicial to the conduct of public affairs) (the Council had now, it explained, decided to disclose SMT minutes in the present case in the interests of transparency) • Any communications within the day opportunities service about service users’ needs which were recorded despite being operational in nature would include personal data to which the exemption in section 40 FOIA would apply (personal information) • There was no financial assessment ‘as such’ made of the pros and cons of closing the day centre and making alternative provision, simply some basic modelling included in Ms Azam’s report. There were some records subsequent to the closure and therefore not, the Council said, within the scope of the request. • The Council did not know which body or individual made the decision to close the centre and when. The centre had been declared surplus to requirements by SWYFT in its Estate Strategy 2012-2022 and ‘[t]he coincidence of opportunities for improved alternative provision for day care, falling numbers at Keresforth, and proposed alternative uses for the wider Keresforth site, meant that closure, which it was understood to be the intention of [SWYFT], was not resisted by the Council’. Cabinet was not involved because the Council was simply acquiescing in the closure of the centre building; alternative arrangements for service users were operational matters. Members were not involved either • The Council accepted that the undated project progress report for Sheffield City Region Public Estate Programme, obtained it seems by Mrs Palmer from SWYFT [91], should have been disclosed. It had not been because of human error, poor filing or inadequate searching • There was no record of a meeting between the CEOs of the Council and SWYFT following the latter’s letter of 22 December 2017. Mrs Terris, the Council’s CEO, had since retired. She had attended a Provider Alliance meeting on 1 March (?2018) at which Mr Webster, the SWYFT CEO, would have been present. There is no record of any discussion of the closure of the Keresforth unit. There did not appear to be a joint communications plan between the two bodies. • The Council did not have the notes taken by Ms Azam, who did not work for it and whose consultancy arrangement had ceased about two years ago. It did have some early drafts of her options appraisal report 6• There were no records about the relocation of staff other than in the disclosed delegated report. 21. Mrs Palmer has given a detailed Reply to the Council’s Response. In part, this consists of arguments about why, in her opinion, the Keresforth unit should not have been closed and why alternative centres were not suitable for her daughter. It is understandable why Mrs Palmer should wish to convey her opinions in this way, given how important the welfare of her daughter is to her and how strongly she feels about the way her daughter has been treated, but the Tribunal’s role is limited to determining what information the Council holds within the scope of the request. 22. However, Mrs Palmer also makes arguments about why she believes the Council has still not disclosed all the information it holds. Her main point is that there must surely be a fuller audit trail about a decision of this magnitude. Why were discussions not minuted, she asks? She adds: ‘you would have thought [a detailed financial assessment] would be required about the viability of the closure and its impact not only to [the Council] but also to The Continuing Health Care budget. Surely discussions/correspondence took place with the respective Commissioners of [the council] and Continuing Health Care before acting on the closure’. If the Council identified who within it made the decisions to close the unit, it would be easier to track down relevant information. If, on the other hand, the decision was made by SWYFT, where was the documentation to support that? Discussion A public authority’s duty on receipt of a request for information 23. Under section 1(1)(b) FOIA, a public authority must disclose information falling within the scope of a request. This is subject to three exceptions. First, it need not disclose information which falls within an exemption (and, where the exemption is a qualified one, the public interest favours withholding the information). Second, it need not do so where the cost of processing the request so would exceed certain limits (section 12 FOIA). Third, it need not do so where the request is vexatious (section 14 FOIA). The Council has not claimed that either of the last two exceptions applies in the present case. 24. In addition, a public authority need only disclose information which it holds. It has no duty to acquire information which it can then pass onto the requester, however easily it could acquire the information. 25. Section 3(2) of FOIA contains a partial definition of whether information is held: ‘For the purposes of this Act, information is held by a public authority if— (a) it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person, or (b) it is held by another person on behalf of the authority’ 26. The definition means that mere possession by a public authority of information is not sufficient (if it is held on behalf of someone else) but also that possession is not 7necessary (if the information is held on behalf of the authority by someone else). An example of the latter would be an archive company. 27. For information to be disclosable it must also be held in recorded form. This is because the definition of ‘information’ in section 84 FOIA is ‘(subject to sections 51(8) and 75(2) [not relevant]) … information recorded in any form’. ‘Recorded form’ implies a degree of permanence. Information which is simply in the mind of an employee is not held in recorded form; similarly, information transmitted verbally is not held in recorded form if no recording is taken. It follows that information comprising discussions which were not preceded by papers and which were not minuted, and which are not evidenced by correspondence or notes or captured on tape, does not have to be disclosed. The Council’s case is that much of the discussion around the closure of the Keresforth unit was not reduced to permanent form. The question is whether the Council held relevant information, not whether it should have done so 28. Subject to the exceptions, a public authority has to disclose information which it in fact holds. Whether it should hold other information is legally irrelevant. Of course, if an authority should hold information it is more likely that it does, particularly where it needs the information to perform its statutory functions. Ultimately, however, a public authority can only be required to disclose information which it actually holds (in the section 3(2) (sense). The Commissioner and the Tribunal must be astute not to order an authority to do the impossible, particularly since there may be serious consequences should it fail to comply with a direction to disclose. The standard of proof 29. It is clear from caselaw that, as one would expect, whether a public authority holds particular information has to be determined on the balance of probabilities: is it more likely that not that it holds particular information? Scope 30. The Tribunal has to determine the scope of the request before it can decide whether relevant information is held. It is clear from the House of Lords’ decision in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner3 that, given the constitutional importance of FOIA (and its Scottish equivalent), requests for information should be construed liberally. This must be particularly so where, as in the present case, the requester is not legally represented. Mrs Palmer could not be expected to frame her request with the precision of a lawyer. Where there is doubt about the intended scope of a request, a public authority should, under its duty under section 16 FOIA to provide advice and assistance, enter into discussions with the requester. 3 [2008] UKHL 47 831. The Council claims to have construed the request in a narrow way, narrower than the Tribunal provisionally did in its CMD. In fact, the scope of the request is perfectly clear. Mrs Palmer wished to have all the information held by the Council relating to the closure of the Keresforth unit. The request expressly asks for minutes, papers and correspondence relating to closure. That leaves no room for doubt about what she wanted. She did not place a time limit such ‘all information since x’ (there is always the risk with an open-ended request that the public authority may rely on section 12 FOIA but the Council has not done so). 32. The one limitation to the width of the request relates to correspondence with other users and their families about alternative provision for individuals service users. Although the request is semantically broad enough to include such correspondence, Mrs Palmer cannot reasonably be thought to have wanted to see it because she would understand that it would contain personal and confidential information. The correspondence falls outside the scope of the request. The time at which the request must be considered 33. Section 1(4) FOIA provides: ‘The information— (a) in respect of which the applicant is to be informed under subsection (1)(a), or (b) which is to be communicated under subsection (1)(b), is the information in question held at the time when the request is received, except that account may be taken of any amendment or deletion made between that time and the time when the information is to be communicated under subsection (1)(b), being an amendment or deletion that would have been made regardless of the receipt of the request’. 34. It follows that, subject to the exception in the full-out words (‘except that … receipt of the request’) - not thought to be relevant in the present case - a public authority need not disclose information which it creates, or which comes into its possession, after the date of the request. That was 3 January 2018. This is relevant because the Council indicates in its Response that certain financial information was created after the Keresforth unit closed. That appears to have been on 20 April 2018. Any information, financial or otherwise, which was in the Council’s possession as at 3 January 2018 should, however, have been identified as held, even if only in the form of drafts or working papers. 35. It follows that the Council did not need to disclose the delegated powers report about relocation of staff because this was produced on 27 April 2018. Disclosure of that report has therefore been made on a voluntary basis. The distinction between whether information is held and whether an exemption applies 936. There are separate questions a public authority must consider on receipt of a FOIA question. First, whether it holds information falling within the scope of the request. Second, whether it has to disclose some or all of that information. 37. The Council has confused these questions. It says that it did not tell Mrs Palmer about the report prepared by Ms Azam because it was confidential (presumably a reference to the exemption in section 41 FOIA). It did not tell her about the SMT meetings because these were private and disclosure of information relating to them would probably prejudice the conduct of public affairs (the exemption in section 36 FOIA). It did not tell her about correspondence with other users because the information was personal to those users (the exemption in section 40(2) FOIA). This the wrong approach. Sometimes a public authority is entitled to refuse even to confirm or deny whether it holds information but the Council does not rely on those provisions. In all other cases, where it does hold requested information, a public authority should inform the requester, even if it relies on one or more of the exemptions from disclosure. This is clear from section 17 FOIA. This includes information which is otherwise available to the requester (see the exemption in section 21 FOIA). Has the Council now disclosed all the information within the scope of the request? 38. Disclosure of information by the Council has been piecemeal. On receipt of the request, it disclosed the slides from Ms Azam’s presentation. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, it disclosed the letter from the SWYFT CEO to its CEO of 20 December 2017 (Mrs Palmer had in fact already obtained a copy through a FOIA request of SWYFT). It has now been prompted by the Tribunal to disclose a number of other documents (some, but by no means all, of which Mrs Palmer had again already obtained from SWYFT). 39. The question is whether the Council holds further information. It admits to holding early drafts of Ms Azam’s options appraisal report. In the Tribunal’s judgment, those fall within the scope of the request. The Tribunal accepts that the Council does not possess the notes taken by Ms Azam and that she does not hold them on its behalf within section 3(2) FOIA. She was an independent consultant and there is no evidence of any contractual provision whereby she agreed to hold on the Council’s behalf information she obtained or generated. Even if the Council had the right to call for the notes, that would not mean that Ms Azam held them on its behalf. It accepts that it holds correspondence with other users and their families but as explained above in the Tribunal’s judgment this is out of scope. Similarly, any information created or obtained by the Council after receipt of the request does not have to be identified as being held or disclosed. 40. Mrs Palmer makes a compelling case as to why the Council should hold more information. A well-run council considering or facing the closure of a day centre for high vulnerable adults would be expected to have had a clear audit trail of discussion papers, correspondence and minutes. It is surprising that the closure of the unit was not discussed at full Council or at least Cabinet. 1041. With some hesitation, however, the Tribunal has concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that the Council has now identified all the information falling within the scope of the request which it holds (and, with the exception of the early drafts of Ms Azam’s report, has disclosed it). Its record of deliberations, record-keeping and record-searching for this project appear to have been shambolic, with no minutes apparently taken of important meetings, and it is scarcely credible that it should not know who was responsible for making the decision to close, or to acquiesce in it if it was primarily SWYFT’s. The distinction the Council seeks to make between operational and strategic is not always convincing, and there are in any event many operational decisions which need to be recorded. Promised follow- up reports were not prepared. There clearly was a report of Ms Azam’s discussions with families, despite an earlier apparent denial by the Council, because it has now been disclosed. There has been staff turnover but good record-keeping should anticipate that. 42. All that said, it is not the Tribunal’s function to rule on the reasonableness of the decision to close the unit and relocate the users or to assess the Council’s internal processes and record-keeping. Its role is simply to determine what the Council holds, within the meaning of sections 3(2) and 84 FOIA. It has pressed the Council hard on this question and it is satisfied that, apart from the early drafts of Ms Azam’s report, there is no further information it holds but has not disclosed. It accepts that all reasonable searches have now been undertaken. 43. The Tribunal has considerable sympathy for Mrs Palmer. She is clearly a dedicated parent, understandably concerned about service provision for her profoundly disabled daughter. She feels that she was not properly involved in the decision to close the unit, which has led, she believes, to her daughter having to go into residential care. She should not have had to fight so hard to get the Council to accept that it held information beyond the slides of Mz Azam’s presentation to families. Conclusion 44. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed. The Commissioner should have probed further. 45. The information which has now been provided would have been a good deal more useful to Ms Palmer had it been supplied when requested, but that, unfortunately, is often the consequence of the time a complaint to the Commissioner and any subsequent appeal takes to determine. 46. The decision is unanimous. Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 13 November 2019 Promulgated Date: 14 November 2019 11"
"3","Procedural Refusal","EA/2019/0163 Between: STOP POLLUTING CAMDEN Appellant: and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent: Hearing: Leeds Magistrates Court: 3 September 2019. Introduction 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under Regulation 18 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘EIR’) and section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“DN”) dated 9 April 2019 (reference FER0780010). 2. The Tribunal Judge Brian Kennedy QC and lay members Jean Nelson and Malcolm Clarke sat to consider this case on 3rd September 2019. Factual Background to this Appeal: 3. Full details of the background to this appeal, the request for information and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the DN (a matter of public record) but essentially the appeal concerns the question of whether the Public Authority, in this case, the London Borough of Camden (“the Council”) was correct to determine that the request was manifestly unreasonable under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR. The Request was made by the Appellant on 13 April 2018 and was for information regarding the operation of ice cream vans in the Borough of Camden and is in the DN, which are not repeated verbatim herein. 1CHRONOLOGY 13 April 2018 FOIA request for information regarding ice-cream vans on certain streets 11 May 2018 Council requests clarification of part of request 5 June 2018 Council refuses, citing EIR reg.12 (4)(b) and stating that it aggregated three other requests from 29 May and 3 June 2018 7 June 2018 Internal review refuses disclosure 27 Aug 2018 Appellant complains to the Commissioner 9 April 2019 DN-upholding refusal of disclosure RELEVANT LEGISLATION Environmental Information Regulations 2004 Reg. 9.

COMMISSIONER’S DECISION NOTICE 4. The Commissioner confirmed that the request fell under EIR. She stated that a request may be deemed ‘manifestly unreasonable’ in two circumstances: it is vexatious, or compliance would incur an unreasonable level of cost or diversion of resources. The Commissioner reminded herself of her guidance on the issue of vexatiousness, namely that the central question is whether the request “is likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress”. 5. The Council explained that the request of 11 May 2018 followed a series of requests about the pollution caused by the diesel engines of street trading ice cream vans, and that the service area of the Council was so small that handling the requests alongside 4the usual workload was unduly burdensome. It added that this was exacerbated by the fact that the information was not recorded in an easily searchable format. The request came from the campaign group ‘Stop Polluting Camden’, a group which it stated began with a serious purpose but made so many requests that the volume of correspondence was no longer in proportion with the value of the request. It told the Commissioner that seven requests comprising 16 questions were sent to the Council between May and November 2017, and then three further requests in May and June 2018. 6. The Appellant raised concerns about the activities of ice-cream vans in the borough, and stated that the group had contacted various Councillors and Council officials to “find out why Camden is not taking action”. It noted that the issue of ice-cream vendor ‘territory’ had resulted in “violence” between rival vendors and as such the individual members of the group are reluctant to identify themselves personally. In regard to the amount of requests, the Appellant stated that “it was not possible for us to identify all the requests in one go because information learned (or provided) identified where further questions might prove relevant… Our use of the FOIA was simply because we were not getting any response from the Council on our attempts to work collaboratively...”. The Appellant accepted a growing sense of frustration, but assured the Commissioner that the group strove to maintain civility and brevity in correspondence. 7. The Commissioner accepted that the group had resorted to FOIA out of frustration and disenchantment with the Council’s responses. Nevertheless, the vexatiousness or reasonability of the request must be judged objectively. The Commissioner accepted that despite the “serious, public spirited motive” for the requests and the history of unsatisfactory engagement, the Council must apportion its resources as it sees fit, and there is “no evidence for wider public concern regarding pollution and ice-cream vans”. While acknowledging that the correspondence has been generally polite, the Commissioner stated that dealing with these questions could cause “an unjustified level or irritation or distress”. She determined that the request of 11 May 2018 has “little value and appears to have little purpose other than to irritate the Council”, citing the fact that “confirmatory or interrogatory questions...is not an appropriate or productive use of EIR”. Instead, she suggested that the matter be referred to the Local Government Ombudsman, as “compliance with the complainant's requests is a necessary or proportionate means of demonstrating the Council’s accountability”. The 5continued requests were deemed to show “unreasonable persistence”, and so reg.12 (4)(b) was engaged. 8. Turning then to the public interest test, the Appellant noted that any burden occasioned by the requests was of the Council’s own making in its failure to engage properly with the group. The wider public interests identified by the group were regarding unlawful trading, pollution and potential misfeasance in public office by reason either of collusion with the traders or “at best...gross incompetence”. The Commissioner warned that any suspicion of wrongdoing must amount to more than a mere allegation, and stated that she could not assess whether there had in fact been any maladministration. This would be within the remit of the Ombudsman, and therefore she attached no weight to the allegations of wrongdoing. She found there to be greater weight in the argument that public authorities must be protected against the disproportionate use of resources by repeat requests from dissatisfied applicants. She was therefore satisfied that there was sufficient evidence that the request was manifestly unreasonable. GROUNDS OF APPEAL 9. The Appellant provided the Tribunal with a dossier of evidence to ground its allegations of wrongdoing on behalf of the Council and to show its history of engagement with various individual Councillors, and listed four grounds of appeal: i. The Commissioner took into account irrelevant considerations, namely some of the previous requests, which the Appellant stated were made by an individual without the approval of the Appellant group; ii. The Commissioner misunderstood one of the requests, which was a line-by-line series of questions. The Appellant stated that it used this format to attempt to clarify what it saw as previous “contradictory responses” from the Council. iii. Insufficient weight was given to the concerns of the Appellant regarding wrongdoing and the evidence it provided to the Commissioner to underpin those concerns; iv. In conceding that there are grounds for complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman, the Commissioner was unreasonable in refusing all information requests. 6COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE 10. The Commissioner reiterated the comments made in Craven v ICO and DECC [2012] UKUT 442 (AAC) at para.30 to the effect that the concept of ‘manifestly unreasonable’ under EIR is essentially the same as ‘vexatious’. She then addressed each of the four grounds in turn. Ground I – Irrelevant Considerations 11. The Commissioner denied that she relied on requests made on the subject by other people to come to the conclusion that the Appellant’s request was manifestly unreasonable; however, she stated that other requests were “an important part of the context in which the present request must be considered” in assessing the burden on the Council. Ground II – Misunderstanding of the request 12. The Commissioner denied that she had misunderstood the request. Instead, she noted that some of the questions appeared “rhetorical and derisory, and an attempt to ridicule the Council” but also accepted that there was a serious motive behind the request. Motive for the request is only one factor to be considered, and it did not override the insulting tone of the request. Ground III – Allegations of wrongdoing 13. The Commissioner stated that the dossier provided by the Appellant did not include any substantiated evidence of wrongdoing or misfeasance on the part of the Council. Ground IV – Wednesbury Unreasonableness 14. The Commissioner stated that she did not conclude that there were grounds for complaint to the Ombudsman; rather, she stated that the allegations are better ventilated before the Ombudsman than the Commissioner. In any event, allegations that the DN was Wednesbury unreasonable are outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and should be pursued through a judicial review. TRIBUNAL FINDINGS 15. The Tribunal concurs that this matter falls within the ambit of the EIR; the request concerns the state, inter alia, of pollution in the air by ice cream vans, and the Council’s policies and activities for the management of such pollution. This is clearly an important issue for the Appellant and the local area, and the Tribunal concurs with the Commissioner that the motive is serious, public-spirited and a matter of significant 7public interest. The Tribunal is somewhat surprised that the Commissioner, having accepted this motive, then went on to state that the request had little purpose other than to irritate the Council. We do not share her view in this regard. 16. Considering the dicta of Judge Wikeley in Craven at para 30, we accept that the concept of ‘manifestly unreasonable’ in EIR is essentially the same as ‘vexatious’. With that in mind, we remind ourselves of the four broad themes identified by Judge Wikeley in Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC): burden on the authority, requester’s motive, request value or purpose, and any harassment or distress occasioned. 17.The context of the case is essential for the consideration of these four themes. The Appellant has provided us with extensive documentation of their attempts to obtain information from the Council without resorting to the framework of FOIA or EIR. We pause here to note that this is precisely the situation in which FOIA and EIR were intended to apply, and attempts to acquire information explicitly through the statutory mechanisms when informal engagement has failed is not generally to be criticised. 18. In contrast to the evidence provided by the Appellant, the Tribunal has not received any significant or persuasive evidence that would establish that the request would be unduly burdensome. We have stated above that accepted the proposition put forward and agreed by the Commissioner and we consider the motive for the request to be public-spirited and genuine. We accept the Respondent’s view that some of the questions at 1 to 9 are confirmatory and interrogatory, which may not be appropriate for an EIR request, however the questions are about an important Council Policy and of significant public interest to which the request of the Appellant’s list of questions are related. The Council did not provide any effective advice or assistance on how to amend or refine the request, as it is supposed to do under Regulation 9. The extent of its engagement with the request was to clarify with the Appellant that it was referring to the Council in its request. We do not accept that the tone of the request was so derisory or offensive as to justify its summary refusal. In all the circumstances and for the above reasons we do not accept that the request was Manifestly Unreasonable. 19.Accordingly, we allow the appeal. The Council may wish to provide advice and assistance to the Appellant as to how best to refine the request. Brian Kennedy QC 1 October 2019. 8"
"4","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0219 Decided without a hearing On 9 May 2019 Before JUDGE ANTHONY SNELSON MR PIETER DE WAAL MR ANDREW WHETNALL Between MR GAVIN RATTRAY Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and WEST LANCASHIRE BOROUGH COUNCIL Second Respondent DECISION The unanimous decision of the Tribunal is that: (1) The appeal is allowed. (2) The First Respondent’s decision that the Second Respondent correctly applied the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, reg 12(4)(b) is set aside and the Tribunal substitutes its own decision that reg 12(4)(b) was not correctly applied and the Second Respondent was not entitled to rely on that provision as entitling it to refuse the Appellant’s request for information dated 27 October 2017. 1REASONS Introduction and procedural history 1. The Appellant, Mr Gavin Rattray, to whom we will refer by name, lives in Burscough, West Lancashire. The area is prone to drainage problems and he has, since 2012 if not earlier, played an active part in pressing responsible bodies for action to protect local people from flooding and associated damage. 2. There is no doubt that the concerns raised by Mr Rattray are serious. He describes without challenge (supported by photographic and other evidence) consequences of heavy rainfall which frequently include blockage of highways and rights of way by standing water and the overflow into roads and gardens of raw sewage. 3. The concerns raised by Mr Rattray are also complex. Physically, they involve the interplay of surface watercourses, groundwater sources and the sewer networks. Legally and administratively, they involve an intricate structure of related and sometimes interlocking responsibilities attached to a number of bodies. The key legislation is the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 which creates, and attaches duties to, Risk Management Authorities (‘RMAs’). 4. The Second Respondent (hereafter ‘the Council’) is the local planning authority for the area in which Burscough lies and, as such, one of the RMAs responsible for managing flood risk locally. 5. Other RMAs with relevant responsibilities are Lancashire County Council (‘LCC’) and United Utilities (‘UU’), the private utilities company which holds the contract for the supply of water and waste water services for the area. 6. On 27 October 2017, through his MP, Ms Rosie Cooper, Mr Rattray wrote to West Lancashire Borough Council requesting information connected with a planning decision relating to a local property. His request was for: 1. Copies of all legal and non-agreements (sic) and accommodations between WLBC and United Utilities made since 2005 concerning the local plans/local development frameworks. This would include the ‘partnership text’ referenced in section 4.17 of [the Council’s] Infrastructure Delivery Plan Update 2016/17 (Part 1). 2. Copies of all communications, notes taken, meeting agendas and minutes meetings between UU and WLBC since January 2013 concerning flooding in Burscough and the local plans/local development frameworks (please don’t supply anything already supplied in 1 above). 23. Copies of all communications, notes taken, meeting agendas and minutes meetings between WLBC and the environment agency concerning surface water flooding (including sewers) and water management in Burscough and its outlying areas of New Lane, Crabtree Lane and Martin Mere. This would include ‘information from the environment agency‘for [the Council’s] Delivery Plan Update 2016/17 (Part 1) and referenced in section 4.17 of it. 7. The Council, through Mr John Harrison, Director of Development and Regeneration, responded in a letter of 7 December 2017, addressed to Ms Cooper. He referred to a “protracted correspondence” between Mr Rattray and Council officers over a number of years regarding drainage matters and to Mr Rattray having issued requests for information under the freedom of information legislation and complaints under the Council’s formal complaints procedure. He continued: Such voluminous amounts of correspondence have caused a disproportionate level of disruption to the Council which is not a good use of the Council’s limited resources and which has distracted officers from the day-to-day running of council business. It is the Council’s view that Mr Rattray’s actions have been an improper use of the formal procedures for which the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 were intended. S14(1) of the FOIA1 is designed to protect public authorities by allowing them to refuse any requests which cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. Mr Rattray in his correspondence has been unreasonably persistent on matters which the Council feels it has already comprehensively addressed. He appears to have taken an unreasonably entrenched position and has submitted frequent correspondence about the same or overlapping issues. It is the Council’s view that Mr Rattray’s requests for information, be that directly with the Council or indirectly, regarding drainage matters in and around Burscough are vexatious and therefore the information is exempt from disclosure under section 14(1) of the Act. 8. M Rattray was dissatisfied. Following a review, Mr Terry Broderick, Borough Solicitor, advised him on 30 January 2018 that the information requested fell within the scope of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘EIR’) (rather than FOIA) but that the request was “vexatious or ‘manifestly unreasonable’” and the exception from the duty to disclose under EIR, reg 12(4)(b) applied. Accordingly, relying on that provision, the Council maintained its refusal. 9. By a letter of 2 January 2018 Mr Rattray complained to the First Respondent (‘the Commissioner’) about the way in which the Council had dealt with his request. 10. The Commissioner proceeded to carry out an investigation, considering the written representations and supporting documents submitted by Mr Rattray and the Council. 1 The 2000 Act. We will adopt the same abbreviation below. 311. By a decision notice dated 19 September 2018 the Commissioner determined that the Council had correctly applied EIR reg 12(4)(b) and that the public interest favoured maintaining the exception. 12. By a notice of appeal dated 9 October 2018, Mr Rattray contended that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong. He made numerous points in support of his central contention that his request of 27 October 2017, and his prior requests for information and other communications with the Council on the subject of flooding risk, had been reasonable and made in the public interest. He further asserted that he had resorted to the freedom of information legislation because of a culture of secrecy in the Council (and other statutory bodies) designed to understate the seriousness of the flooding problem locally and avoid taking necessary remedial action. 13. By her response dated 7 November 2018 the Commissioner resisted the appeal contending that her decision of 19 September 2018 was correct. In the same document, she noted that it was apparent from the contributions of Mr Rattray and the Council that they disagreed on matters of fact and that in the circumstances it might be necessary to add the Council as a party to the proceedings. 14. The Council was duly joined as Second Respondent. 15. The Council’s response to the appeal, dated 4 January 2019, defended its reliance on reg 12(4)(b), and developed the arguments already made in response to Mr Rattray’s request. It repeated the broad complaint of frequent and overlapping requests and of “unreasonable persistence” on his part. It also charged him with using an “accusatory” tone. The applicable law 16. EIR, reg 5(1) requires a public authority holding ‘environmental information’ to make it available on request. 17. ‘Environmental information’ is defined broadly in reg 2(1) as: … information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on – (a) the state of the elements of the environment … (b) factors … affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment … (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans … 18. Reg 12 sets out exceptions to the reg 5(1) duty. It includes: (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) … a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if - 4(a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) …; and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. ... (4) For the purposes of … a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that – … (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable … 19. In our view the effect of these provisions is clear. Reg 12(1)(b) places the burden firmly on the public authority relying on an exception to show two things: first, that the exception (here, that under sub-para (4)(b)) applies, and second, if (but only if) it does, that the public interest favours maintaining it. That the onus is on the public authority is evident from the wording of the legislation and confirmed by the authorities. The point is further reinforced by sub-para (2), which operates at both stages of the analysis. 20. We note with some consternation that our understanding of the statutory framework seems incompatible with the Commissioner’s written case. As we have recorded, she contends that the appeal should be dismissed on the footing that the public interest favours maintaining the exception. On our reading of reg 12, the public interest test does not arise at all unless and until the public authority shows that the exception is applicable. This divergence has caused us anxiously to examine our thinking afresh. Having done so, and with diffidence, we stand by it. We regret that we were not able to explore these matters with the parties face-to-face. The disadvantages of deciding disputes like this without an oral hearing have been commented upon at a higher level (we will come back to this later). 21. Not surprisingly, the Regulations do not offer a definition of ‘manifestly unreasonable’. Our duty is to give those familiar words their natural meaning, guided by authority binding upon us. 22. Given the fact that the parties agree that EIR is the applicable regime, it might seem strange that representations by the Respondents have been modelled largely on FOIA and case-law thereunder. This is, however, appropriate. By the Act, s14(1), a public authority is excused from complying with a request for information if the request is “vexatious”. In Craven v Information Commissioner and Department for Energy and Climate Change [2012] UKUT 442 (ACC) the Upper Tribunal (‘UT’) (Judge Nicholas Wikeley) held that the tests under s14(1) and reg 12(4)(b) are to all intents and purposes the same. On appeal, the Court of Appeal (reported at [2015] 1 WLR 5316) agreed. Giving the lead judgment, Arden LJ remarked that any difference was “vanishingly small” (para 78). 523. With Craven the UT considered two other appeals, Dransfield v Information Commissioner and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and Ainslie v Information Commissioner and Dorset County Council [2012] UKUT 441 (AAC), and gave judgment in all three on the same day. In Dransfield, a case under FOIA, s14(1), Judge Wikeley, at para 27, expressed agreement with an earlier first-instance decision that – “… vexatious”, connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure.” The judge continued (para 28): Such misuse of the FOIA procedure may be evidenced in a number of different ways. It may be helpful to consider the question of whether a request is truly vexatious by considering four broad issues or themes – (1) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (2) the motive (of the requester); (3) the value or serious purpose (of the request) and (4) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). However, these four considerations … are not intended to be exhaustive, nor are they meant to create an alternative formulaic check-list. 24. Dransfield and Craven were heard together in the Court of Appeal. Arden LJ noted (para 60) that the UT’s guidance just cited was not directly in issue on the appeal, but added these remarks (para 68): In my judgment, the UT was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and this is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. 2 The decision-maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. In another significant passage, Arden LJ remarked (para 72): Before I leave this appeal, I note that the UT held that the purpose of section 14 was “to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA” … For my own part, I would wish to qualify that aim as one only to be realised if the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied. 25. The Council relied heavily on the Guidance published by the Commissioner. The UT passed certain comments on the Guidance relating to vexatious requests which, we understand, led to parts of it being modified. On appeal, Arden LJ commented (para 32): 2 This echoes remarks in paras 2 and 3 about the importance and constitutional significance of the right to freedom of information. 6The IC has a statutory obligation … to issue guidance … The guidance covers such matters as dealing with vexatious requests. Various government departments have also issued guidance … As this guidance does not have special status in matters of interpretation, it is not necessary for me to cite it in my conclusions. For my own part, while I welcome the issue of such advice, I do not find it provided assistance in resolving the issues on these appeals. We likewise note the Guidance but our interpretation of the law is founded on the statutory language and relevant decisions of the higher courts. 26. The appeal is brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, s57. The Tribunal’s powers in determining the appeal are delineated in s58 as follows: (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal consider – (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law; or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. The Council’s case 27. In its letter to Ms Cooper of 7 December 2017, the Council stated that Mr Rattray had been involved in a “protracted exchange of correspondence” with its officers over a number of years and that the “voluminous amounts of correspondence” had caused “a disproportionate level of disruption to the Council”. His actions were characterised as “an improper use of the formal procedures” for which the freedom of information legislation was intended. It was said that he had taken “an unreasonably entrenched position” and had submitted “frequent correspondence about the same or overlapping issues”. 28. By a letter of 27 June 2018 responding to the Commissioner’s questions, the Council supplied further detail in support of its case. It traced Mr Rattray’s pursuit of concerns back to January 2012. It claimed that its position was vindicated by a Planning Inspector, who had found that the Local Plan was “sound” and dealt appropriately with flooding and drainage matters, but that Mr Rattray had refused to accept that finding and had persisted in raising the same or similar points. In particular it cited limbs (1) and (3) of the request of 27 October 2017 as “directly related to similar requests already dealt with”, but did not identify those requests. It referred to Mr Rattray’s activity in his personal capacity and as secretary of the Burscough Flooding Group (‘BFG’), noting that other members of that body had written to the Council seeking 7“very similar information” and observed, “the collective, repeated enquiries of a similar nature from the BFG [was] a key part of the context to the Council considering the request vexatious”. Wrongly (as it now admits), it identified ‘Mr C’ as a member of the BFG and prayed in aid the fact that he had submitted 10 freedom of information requests between March and December 2017, which resulted in 41 exchanges of correspondence involving four officers of the Council. Reliance was also placed on the fact that Mr Rattray had sent communications outside the scope of the freedom of information legislation and had invoked the Council’s complaints procedure as well as pursuing a complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman. 29. Turning to the effect of this activity, the letter of 27 June 2018 complained that a great deal of time been spent responding to “multiple and overlapping requests”, which had placed “a huge strain on time and resources”. It was said that the requests were the work of “a number of requestors acting in concert as part of their campaign” and that the disruption caused was out of proportion to “any wider valuable public interest in making the requested information publicly available”. In the circumstances, the Council contended that it was justified in refusing the request. In doing so, it acknowledged the need for a balancing exercise between “the serious purpose and value of the requests, the requestor’s aims and motivation and the wider public interest against the detrimental effect on the authority”. It added that its position would, “of course”, be kept under review. 30. In a further letter to the Commissioner, dated 30 July 2018, the Council set out in table form some information concerning the 10 information requests submitted by Mr C and the five by Mr Rattray, but (although it is clear that all requests related to flooding and drainage aspects) the detail is too sparse to enable one to assess the extent if any to which requests were duplicated or overlapped. In support of the assertion of a concerted campaign, the Council drew attention to the fact that Mr Rattray had copied certain correspondence to Mr C. The Council’s letter made it clear that its reliance on the ‘vexatiousness’ defence was confined to part of Mr C’s last request and Mr Rattray’s last request. 31. The Council’s response to the appeal, dated 4 January 2019, develops the points made in the earlier documents already reviewed. It acknowledges that the prior assertion that Mr C was a member of the BFG was wrong but insists that his activities are nonetheless relevant to the defence of Mr Rattray’s claim. It complains of the length and detail of Mr C’s correspondence, citing in particular a 79-page document prepared by him in support of Mr Rattray. It passes similar comment on Mr Rattray’s response to the Local Plan Review Preferred Options Public Consultation, attached as part of his written case. 32. In the response, paras 21-26, the Council is also critical of the “accusatory tone and manner” in which, it is said, Mr Rattray’s case has been pursued (a charge 8also levelled at Mr C). Reference is made to emails sent in November and December 2018 (ie well over a year after the request under consideration) in which he referred to the Council making “bogus claims”, offering a “dubious fictional account” and, making allegations of vexatiousness and malicious time-wasting “as a convenient tactic to discourage interested residents.” The Council also quotes an article written by Mr Rattray and an email sent by him to a representative of a local newspaper, The Champion, both of which, again, appear to post-date the November 2017 request by a considerable period, which express anger and frustration at the perceived failure of the Council to deal with flooding problems locally. The Council draws attention to his remarks such as, “… as you’d expect battling to get Burscough’s flooding acknowledged by WLBC is going badly as normal.” The Council also places reliance on an anonymous social media post dated 4 October 2018 by the West Lancashire Record entitled, “If At First You Don’t Succeed, Become Vexatious”. It is evident that the piece was composed by someone with knowledge of the request of 27 October 2017 and the subsequent response of the Council and adjudication of the Commissioner. It is deeply critical of the Council’s perceived failure to deal with the flooding problems in Burscough and its response to the request. It ends by ironically congratulating “the complainant” for the successful outcome conveyed in the Commissioner’s subsidiary finding that the Council was in breach of the freedom of information legislation by failing to respond within the statutory 20 working days period, adding, “you’ve proved that those bureaucrats ARE accountable!” Despite its title, however, the post does not advocate the presentation of further requests for information, vexatious or otherwise. If anything, its general tenor is that no good would come of doing so. 33. At para 38 of the response, the Council says this: Whilst the Council understands the Appellant’s concerns regarding flooding in Burscough, it considers that Mr Rattray has exhausted the use of FOI/EIR and that other more appropriate routes should be used to feed in his concerns and those of residents about flooding issues namely through the planning application process and local plan consultation. The Commissioner’s case 34. The Commissioner explicitly acknowledges a clear public interest in favour of the disclosure of the requested information but concludes that it is outweighed by the public interest in favour of upholding the reg 12(4)(b) exception, on the basis that the burden of complying with the request would be disproportionate when compared with the benefit to the public of doing so. The Commissioner largely adopts the Council’s narrative of events, although very properly acknowledging that she is not in a position to resolve factual conflicts to which Mr Rattray has drawn attention. 9Mr Rattray’s case 35. Mr Rattray agrees that he has been an active and vociferous campaigner on planning and, in particular, flooding issues over an extended period. At some point before 2012 he joined the Burscough Action Group (BAG), a large body of local residents opposed to plans for local development and took on the informal role of ‘researcher’. He was involved in the preparation and submission of freedom of information requests on behalf of BAG directed to the Council, LCC and the EA. He also used the Council’s formal complaints procedure to complain about the behaviour of a particular councillor at a meeting with residents and pursued an appeal against the Council’s decision to take no action against him. 36. BAG was closely involved in local debate concerning the West Lancashire 2012 Local Plan. Mr Rattray submitted to the Planning Inspector documents obtained through freedom of information requests. Contrary to the Council’s case, he maintains that the Inspector imposed conditions in respect of two developments the effect of which was to prohibit any net increase in the burden on the surface water and sewer systems resulting from those developments. Moreover, in the course of public examination of the Plan, UU gave assurances about the longer term, promising to apply in 2015 for funding for the expansion and improvement of the sewer network. 37. BAG was disbanded as soon as the Local Plan was approved and Mr Rattray had very few dealings with the Council over the next three years or so, hoping that the favourable events of 2012 would lead to an end to the flooding and drainage problems. These hopes were disappointed. UU did not secure the anticipated funding and the sewer network was not improved. Frequent episodes of flooding, now exacerbated by the recent construction activity, continued. 38. In 2016 Mr Rattray was one of a handful of individuals who formed the Burscough Flooding Group (‘BFG’). The body, which has five members, describes itself as a non-political volunteer flood action group. It was established at the behest of the Burscough Parish Council (‘BPC’). It has a proper constitution and is a member of the National Flooding Forum. Mr Rattray was and is its secretary. 39. BFG has been an energetic and articulate advocate for local people concerned about drainage and planning matters in the area. It often provides advice to residents and makes representations to relevant bodies on their behalf. At the invitation of BPC, it prepares submissions on planning applications. It pursued formal complaints to the Council in respect of two particular developments and, when both were rejected, took the matter, at the Council’s suggestion, to the Local Government Ombudsman (‘LGO’). That proved a fruitless exercise 10because, as BFG discovered in due course, LGO can only entertain cases brought by persons directly affected by the matter complained of. 40. BFG has been instrumental in achieving successful outcomes for local residents on occasions. One such, in or about 2016, was to secure the agreement of the developer of the Booths site at Ringtail Retail Park to abandon plans for a proposed connection of a surface water overflow to the Lordsgate Lane sewers, which was judged likely to create a significant additional flooding risk. 41. Another notable piece of work carried out by BFG was the publication in May 2017 of the Burscough Flood Records Report, prepared at the request of the BPC. It documents incidents of flooding between 2008 and 2017 and includes maps, photographs and an exceedingly detailed commentary. The executive summary states: The [Burscough Flooding] Group has found that the causes of flooding were predominantly water discharging from United Utilities surface water and foul sewers in the urban areas; and inadequate capacity of ordinary watercourses, fed with urban surface water run-off, in the downstream rural areas. The report, and the work of BFG generally, have been strongly commended by BPC. In 2018 LCC requested that the report, and further contributions from the BFG be included in a government-funded study of Burscough’s drainage problems. 42. The freedom of information request which gives rise to this appeal was the fifth addressed by Mr Rattray to the Council. The first four spanned a period from 28 February to 22 May 2017 and all concerned flooding and drainage issues in the Burscough area. The Council responded to all of them. The Respondents contend that the requests overlapped to a certain extent and although the material before us does not enable us to verify that assertion we think, given the narrowness of the subject-matter, that it is more likely than not that there was a degree of overlap. Mr Rattray does not appear to say otherwise. He does, however, deny repeating requests for information. He says that the only exception occurred in 2017 when he re-issued a request concerning UU which had been refused some time before on, he says, what he came to realise was an unsustainable ground, namely commercial confidentiality. 43. Mr Rattray accepts that his requests were (at least in some instances) “voluminous”, but stresses that they were necessarily so given the complexity of the subject matter. 44. The purpose of the freedom of information requests is explained by Mr Rattray in these words: 11BFG’s aim, in using FOI legislation, is to reveal information which would otherwise be hidden from the public, so that real change can be implemented to the benefit of the community. He maintains that, without the information secured through freedom of information requests, it would have been impossible to secure the changes to the local plan in 2012, to produce the BFG report in 2017 and to protect local residents in other ways, such as through the amendment to the plan affecting the Lordsgate Lane sewers. 45. Contrary to the Council’s case, Mr Rattray states that he, and BFG as a whole, have been and remain willing to attend meetings with the Council and that it is the Council which has refused to engage. He says that the Council also ignores his correspondence. Generally, he complains that the Council’s stance has consistently been obstructive and characterised by an inappropriate preoccupation with secrecy. In that regard he cites a freedom of information request by BAG, again presented through the local MP, which took the Council 12 months to answer and, when it was answered, was accompanied by a request that the information be not released to BAG. 46. As the Respondents now accept, Mr C is not, and has never been, a member of BFG. He is a local resident and shares many of the concerns and aims pursued by BFG (and others) relating to drainage and flooding problems. Mr Rattray agrees that he has on occasions exchanged information and correspondence with him. 47. Mr Rattray denies the general charge of adopting an “accusatory tone”, but does not dispute using robust language on occasions. He explains that the reference to “bogus claims” and a “dubious fictional account” responded to the untrue assertions of the Council about Mr C being a member of BAG and BFG and submitting freedom of information requests on behalf of BFG. He denies that the West Lancashire Record post was written by him or any other member of BFG. As for the email to The Champion, he protests that his message was intended to be private and not for public dissemination, but he stands by what he said and defends his (and BFG’s) right to inform the public on flooding issues and put pressure on public authorities to bring about change. Analysis and conclusions 48. Rightly, the parties agree that EIR is the applicable regime. 49. We preface our conclusions by observing that the agreement for the case to be decided on the papers may have operated to the disadvantage of the Council, on whom the onus rests to justify its reliance on reg 12(4)(b). Had we heard evidence from Mr Rattray and seen him tested in cross-examination, we might (or might not) have been persuaded to take a less indulgent view of his motivation in making the request of 27 October 2017 and/or in some at least of 12his prior agitation. Likewise, we might (or might not) have been more impressed by the Council’s protestations concerning the burden of the request and its predecessors, the pressure on resources generally and related points, had we heard from a witness on those matters and seen his or her evidence tested.3 50. Even with common ground that the matter was to proceed as a ‘paper hearing’, the Respondents could have presented evidence in written form, signed and dated, from an officer of the Council suitably qualified by experience and qualifications, adding hard facts to the general assertions contained in their formal documents. Evidence might, for example, have addressed such topics as (a) the amount of time spent on prior requests (and why); (b) the amount of time likely to be required to comply with the current request (and why); and (c) the extent to which dedication of resources to dealing with Mr Rattray’s requests has prejudiced, or would be likely to prejudice, the Council’s capacity to discharge its numerous other duties (and why). 51. We make these observations because they are important. We fully understand that the right to disclosure of information is not untrammelled and we are mindful of the fact that local authorities bear an unforgiving load of statutory duties which they are expected to discharge with diminishing resources. The Council is entitled to a sympathetic hearing. But cases are made out on evidence, not mere assertion. The Council’s case before us consists very largely of assertion. 52. There is one further prefatory observation which must be made. The papers before us disclose some points of fact on which Mr Rattray and the Council disagree. These include matters such as the nature and effect of the Planning Inspector’s adjudication in 2012 and the dispute as to which ‘side’ is responsible for the sad fact (apparently agreed) that meetings do not take place between them. Without evidence we are in no position to resolve such conflicts and we have not attempted to do so. 53. The Commissioner asks us to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. As already explained, we think that this ignores the prior question whether the exception is shown to be applicable. We answer that question in the negative. We have seven main reasons for our conclusion. These correspond to a large extent with the points identified in the guidance provided in Dransfield at Court of Appeal and UT level, but we have been careful not to apply it mechanically or to treat it as a substitute for the statutory language. We are mindful of the need to consider all the circumstances and to adopt a rounded and holistic approach. 3 The potential disadvantages of ‘paper’ hearings were commented upon by the UT in Craven (para 73). 1354. The first reason is that it is not shown that the request has no reasonable foundation (see the judgment of Arden LJ in Dransfield, para 68, cited above). Rightly, the Respondents made no such suggestion. 55. Second, it is not shown that the request under consideration, seen in isolation or in the wider context of prior requests, had a malign or improper purpose or motivation. On the material presented to us we find it quite impossible to say that Mr Rattray is or has ever been actuated by any improper motive. It is plain that the concerns which he has been raising over many years are serious and that the flooding and draining problems locally continued to be unresolved at the time of his most recent request. It is also plain that he genuinely believes that the Council has consistently neglected its risk management obligations. Moreover, he is clearly right to point out that, given the subject-matter, it is in the nature of things that circumstances change, new problems develop, new information is generated and new questions arise which can legitimately be directed to responsible bodies. Here, it is demonstrated that episodes of flooding have continued to occur and local developments over the years have put added pressure on water management systems generally. In such a case, the Council’s objection that Mr Rattray is unduly persistent is not persuasive. The Tribunal would look much more critically at a request directed to an historical event which had already been fully explored (through information requests and otherwise), but in this case, we are concerned with something quite different, namely a long-standing but developing controversy. Lastly on the question of motivation, we think it significant that Mr Rattray had very few dealings with the Council for about three years from 2012 to 2015, hopeful that the successes (as he saw them) of 2012 would pave the way for a resolution of the problems. This argues against the suggestion of an obsessive or malicious mind-set on his part. 56. Third, it is not shown that the request was excessive in scope. The Council’s own case appeared to acknowledge that the specific request, in itself, could not be characterised as excessive and that it was the wider historical context which made it so. That is plainly right. Having examined the evidence carefully, we are not persuaded that the requests for information presented by Mr Rattray, viewed collectively, have been excessive. We accept that some requests have overlapped to a degree, but the Council’s case on this aspect (as generally) lacks sufficient clarity to enable a proper assessment to be made. Moreover, it is in the nature of things, given the subject-matter of the requests, that a degree of overlap will be hard to avoid and we remind ourselves that the freedom of information provisions are intended to be available to all (see generally Craven, UT, para 96) and must not be treated as demanding the drafting skills of the High Court practitioner. Moreover, to the extent that any request overlaps with a prior request there is little or no prejudice to the Council: it can refer to a previous answer rather than producing the information afresh. The evidence presented does not substantiate the Council’s vague assertion that Mr Rattray has repeated requests for information, other than on the single occasion which 14he has admitted and explained. We accept that it is legitimate in principle for a public authority to have regard to requests for information made by persons other than the requester. We also accept that the Council’s case on this aspect is not defeated by the simple fact that Mr C is not and has never been a member of BFG. But its problem is that, for want of specifics and detail, and for the other reasons already given in respect of overlap with Mr Rattray’s prior claims, the complaint of a cumulatively excessive set of requests is not sustained. We bear in mind here that the Council answered Mr Rattray’s first four requests and Mr C’s first nine without objection. 57. Fourth, it is not shown that the effect of the request would be to impose an excessive or disproportionate burden upon the Council. As already stated, in relation to the request viewed in isolation, that proposition is more or less conceded. Having regard to the context, and specifically the history of prior requests, we are satisfied that the same conclusion applies. We have already commented on the sparseness of the Council’s case and in particular the absence of hard facts and evidence. We are not provided with any detail as to, for example, the number of hours of staff time which would need to be devoted to answering the current request, the hours spent on prior requests, the impact on other services, and so on. A case based on assertion and hand- wringing alone will not prevail. 58. Fifth, we are troubled by the logic of the Council’s case, which it does not shrink from expressing in plain language, that the door must now be closed on any further request for information related to flooding risk in and around Burscough. That logic runs counter to the entire spirit of the freedom of information legislation. It seeks to deprive Mr Rattray and, by extension, other concerned individuals who might be seen as associated with him, apparently for ever, of an important constitutional right to seek information in order to hold a public body to account on a matter of obvious public significance. In addition, it ignores the point already made (see our second ground above) that the subject-matter of Mr Rattray’s concerns is not an historic, cut-and-dried event but a phenomenon which recurs with notable frequency, the causes of which, and possible solutions for which, are prone to change as time passes and circumstances, in particular those that bear on the capacity of existing waste water management systems to cope with increasing demand, evolve. 59. Sixth, the fact that there may be other means (such as engaging in planning consultations) through which Mr Rattray is free to ventilate his concerns does not warrant an outcome denying him access to his right to freedom of information. 60. Seventh, on the material presented, and excluding points in dispute which we could not resolve without evidence, we reject the Council’s contention that Mr Rattray’s manner and tone in airing his concerns, through requests for information or otherwise, warrant the conclusion that the request under 15consideration is “manifestly unreasonable.” It is certainly true that he has complained vociferously that the Council has failed to live up to its responsibilities and has tried to minimise the problems to which he draws attention. He has also not hesitated to rehearse the history going back to 2012 and before but there is of itself nothing vexatious about that. Indeed, without doing so he would struggle to make his essential complaint, namely that responsible bodies have had ample time to get to grips with the serious flooding problem and, far from doing so and resolving it, have overseen a state of affairs in which, if anything, it has deteriorated. His comments may be unwelcome and perhaps uncomfortable on occasions for Council decision- makers but in a democratic society those who hold public office must accept robust challenge from time to time. It is not shown that he has said or done anything before the request or since 4 amounting to, or coming close to, harassment or abuse. There is no suggestion of distress or harm being suffered by Council staff. Outcome and postscript 61. We do not suggest that any of these reasons is individually determinative of the appeal. But we are satisfied that, taken together, they lead irresistibly to the conclusion that reg 12(4)(b) was not correctly applied. It follows that the appeal must be allowed. 62. Finally, we think that Mr Rattray would do well to think carefully before having further recourse to the freedom of information legislation. With every new request the risk of the Council meeting it with a successful defence under EIR, reg 12(4)(b) is likely to increase, particularly if our observations about the need to substitute evidence for mere assertion are taken on board. We would suggest that before any decision to present a further request for information he should ask himself in particular the following questions. (a) Does the proposed request repeat, or overlap (to any extent) with, any previous request? (b) Is the information reasonably necessary for the purposes of furthering any legitimate goal or objective? (c) Is the information available from some other source? (d) Does the proposed request for any other reason expose him to a real risk of being legitimately accused of a misuse of the freedom of information provisions? (e) Even if he is satisfied that the proposed request is proper in principle can it be improved by (i) making it more concise and/or (ii) narrowing its scope and/or (iii) clarifying the language in which it is couched? Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dated: 27 June 2019 4 The evidence relied upon by the Council is on its face irrelevant, since it post-dates the request. 16"
"5","Procedural Refusal","EA/2018/0273 Between: NICK QUINN Appellant: and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent: and MID DEVON DISTRICT COUNCIL Second Respondent: Before: Brian Kennedy QC, Paul Taylor LLM BA (Hons.) & Anne Chafer LLM BA (Hons.). Sitting in London on 28 May & 3 July 2019. DECISION Introduction: 1[1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”) The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“DN”) dated 15 November 2018 (reference FER0742219). The Appellant requested that this Notice not be published prior to the conclusion of the appeal, as in his view it contained personal information, the publication of which he had not provided consent and the Tribunal orders no publication of this Decision until such times as all appeals as are entitled to be sought have been exhausted. Factual Background to this Appeal: [2] Full details of the background to this appeal, the request for information and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the DN and not repeated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether the Mid Devon District Council (“the Council”) was correct to determine that the request was manifestly unreasonable under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the Environmental Information Regulations. CHRONOLOGY: 3 Dec 2017 Request for minutes of all meetings of the Council’s Capital Strategy Asset Group since its inception, to include any documents referred to 3 Jan 2018 Council rejects request on the basis that compliance would exceed FOIA time limits, but advised it could provide 2 years worth of information within the time limit 4 Jan 2018 Appellant refines request to include all minutes already in electronic form from 2012, or in the alternative just the minutes with the option of later requesting specific reports 11 Jan 2018 Council indicates to Appellant that it will consider the revised request 23 Feb 2018 Council refuses, citing EIR reg.12 (5)(e) commercial confidentiality and 212(4)(e) internal communications. Appellant immediately requests an internal review. 26 April 2018 Internal review refuses disclosure and adds reliance on reg.12 (4)(d) material in the course of completion and 12(5)(d) confidentiality of proceedings 29 April 2018 Appellant complains to the Commissioner 15 Nov 2018 Decision notice holding that the Council breached regs.5 (2) for delay in responding to the initial request, reg.14(2) for the delay in citing the correct exception and reg.9(1) in failing to provide adequate advice and assistance RELEVANT LEGISLATION: Environmental Information Regulations 2004 9. Advice and assistance (1) A public authority shall provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to applicants and prospective applicants. (2) Where a public authority decides that an applicant has formulated a request in too general a manner, it shall - (a) ask the applicant as soon as possible and in any event no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the request, to provide more particulars in relation to the request; and (b) assist the applicant in providing those particulars.

(4) Where paragraph (2) applies, in respect of the provisions in paragraph (5), the date on which the further particulars are received by the public authority shall be treated as the date after which the period of 20 working days referred to in those provisions shall be calculated. (5) The provisions referred to in paragraph (4) are - 3(a) regulation 5(2); (b) regulation 6(2)(a); and (c) regulation 14(2). 12. Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. (3) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that – (a) it does not hold that information when an applicant’s request is received; (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable; (c) the request for information is formulated in too general a manner and the public authority has complied with regulation 9; (d) the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data; or (e) the request involves the disclosure of internal communications. (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect – (a) international relations, defence, national security or public safety; (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; (c) intellectual property rights; (d) the confidentiality of the proceedings of that or any other public authority where such confidentiality is provided by law; (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest; 4(f) the interests of the person who provided the information where that person – (i) was not under, and could not have been put under, any legal obligation to supply it to that or any other public authority; (ii) did not supply it in circumstances such that that or any other public authority is entitled apart from these Regulations to disclose it; and (iii) has not consented to its disclosure; or (g) the protection of the environment to which the information relates. 14.

COMMISSIONER’S DECISION NOTICE: 5[3] The requested minutes represent a record of transactions and decisions regarding sites sold or developed within the Council district. The minutes were not intended for publication. The Council argued that while it had not explicitly cited reg.12 (4)(b) to the Appellant initially, it had stated in February 2018 that acquiring the necessary consents to release “historic minutes” would exceed the time limits. It also informed the Commissioner that the minutes in question contain information pertaining to numerous properties belonging to various parties; it also advised “the items are regarding matters that may not have yet or may never happen and pertaining to complex legal negotiations”. Reviewing and redacting the minutes would, in the view of the Council, run in excess of 50 hours work. [4] The Commissioner reviewed the material, and accepted that it would have to be manually reviewed. As specific sites and properties are identified within the minutes, a review of each set of minutes would have to carry out in regards to 3rd party personal data, and the Commissioner accepted that the Council’s time estimates were reasonable. As such, this would exceed the FOIA time allowance for the consideration of requests. The Commissioner detailed how this provision, while not directly applicable to the Appellant’s request, was instructive for how public authorities could consider the burden of requests under EIR. In this instance, the Commissioner was satisfied that compliance with the request would require a “significant diversion” of resources, leading to a “disruption in the delivery of core services”. [5] Turning then to the public interest test, the Commissioner considered the arguments put forward by the Appellant, namely the importance of ensuring that elected officials engage in robust and meaningful discussions about the dealings with Council assets. He claimed that public confidence in the Council was low, and that the annual increases in Council Tax increase the importance of accountability for the Council in this regard. [6] The Council focused its submissions on the public interest around the issue of commercial confidentiality; an issue that the Commissioner pointed out was irrelevant to the consideration of an excessive burden caused by compliance. The Commissioner considered that the burden would be excessive. She placed reliance on the Appellant declining the Council’s suggestion to limit his request to two years’ worth of minutes, deciding that this resulted in his request being “insufficiently targeted”. She did however concede that narrowing the time frame would not permit 6the Appellant to achieve his stated aim, namely tracking outcomes of the committee over a period of time. [7] The Commissioner did criticise the Council for agreeing to consider the Appellant’s request even after he had declined to narrow the time frame, as this did not help the Appellant to submit a less onerous request. Similarly, in citing the wrong exceptions, the Council failed in its duty under reg.9 to provide appropriate assistance. She also stated that, contrary to the Council’s assertions, she was unable to find that the request had been vexatious as the Appellant’s motivations were not sufficiently clear from the information she had been provided. GROUNDS OF APPEAL: [8] The Appellant argued seven broad grounds of appeal: Ground I – Factual errors in the Decision Notice The Appellant pointed out errors in paragraph numbering and dates, but also claimed that the DN repeated statements made by the Council that the Appellant considered “factually incorrect and contain personal, and confidential information which is not relevant to the decision”. Ground II – procedural unfairness The Appellant stated that the correspondence with the Council regarding his request never raised reg.12 (4)(b) and to allow the Council to raise it eleven months after the request and six months after the refusal was inappropriate. He criticised the Commissioner for failing to “find fault” with the Council’s failure to identify the correct legislative exception, and was of the view that it was “wholly inappropriate” for the Commissioner to conduct a public interest balancing exercise as the Council had never purported to do one. Ground III – failures in the Commissioner’s investigation In declining to characterise the request as vexatious, the Commissioner noted that she did not have enough information to determine whether the Appellant’s motives were legitimate. The Appellant claims that the Commissioner did not attempt to clarify with him his motives, nor to check the accuracy of certain assertions by the Council with him. The Appellant argued that the Commissioner had failed to consider adequately the Council’s failings in the handling of his initial request, particularly in relying on the 7incorrect legislation as a basis to refuse the request. He also stated that she had not given sufficient weight to his willingness to refine and reduce the scope of his request. The Commissioner appeared to have characterised his revised request as a ‘rejection’ of the Council’s suggestion, and the Appellant disputed this; he stated that this was an attempt to engage with the Council, who had failed to provide him with adequate and meaningful assistance. This was also supported by the fact that the Council had ‘accepted’ the revised request. Ground IV – request not manifestly unreasonable The Council informed the Commissioner that 20 sets of minutes fell to be considered, and the work required to examine, redact and acquire the necessary consents would run in excess of 50 hours. The Commissioner had examined only one set of minutes, and had found 31 entries that would require review for 3 rd party information or exceptions. The Appellant argued that in basing her determination in regards the reasonableness of the request on one single set of minutes, the Commissioner could not be satisfied that the sample she had been given was fair or representative of the remaining minutes. He referred again to the Council’s “acceptance” of the scope of the revised request to argue that it shows that it was not unreasonable. COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE: [9] The Commissioner began by outlining the EIR definition of environmental information and the stages of analysis for the determination of any request. She also referred the Tribunal to the well-known cases of Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC), Craven [2012] UKUT 442 (AAC) and the combined appeal Dransfield and Craven v ICO et al [2015] EWCA Civ 454. In that line of case law, it was affirmed that the cost of compliance alone or in part could not render a request vexatious, but it was a factor for consideration in determining whether a request was manifestly unreasonable. In that situation, the decision-maker must balance the burden placed on the authority against the value or serious purpose of the request. There is therefore a higher threshold to be reached in order to justify refusing a request under EIR than FOIA, but the FOIA cost limits can be used as a guideline for the consideration of EIR requests. Ground I – Factual errors in the Decision Notice The Commissioner denied that she had made any errors, and the errors of which the Appellant complained were merely her reiterating the arguments of the Council about 8why they considered the Appellant’s request vexatious. She did not consider that the information contained in the reiteration of the Council’s statements was the Appellant’s personal information from which he was identifiable as he had “neither particularised nor evidenced” this. Ground II – procedural unfairness The Commissioner accepted that she had not criticised the Council for referring to the incorrect regime in its first response to the request, but noted that this error was rectified by the Council in the course of its dealings with the Appellant. The Council had explained to the Appellant in the outcome of the internal review that such matters could fall under either legislative regime. As for the other exceptions that the Council had relied upon in refusing the request, the Commissioner determined that those had been “effectively withdraw[n]” by the Council’s final reliance on reg.12(4)(b) and as such she was not obliged to consider them. It is settled practice that public authorities can claim reliance on new exceptions or exemptions during an appeal to the Tribunal: Birket v DEFRA [2011] EWCA Civ 1606, and ICO v Home Office [2011] UKUT 17 (AAC). It was this practice that allowed the Commissioner to consider reg.12 (4)(b) as raised by the Council, even at that late stage. Even though the Council had not explicitly laid out its arguments in regards the public interest, the Commissioner is still obliged under the legislation to perform that balancing exercise, using the arguments about the costs that the Council put forward as well as her own analysis of the situation. Ground III – Failures in the Commissioner’s investigation The request that the Commissioner considered was the Appellant’s revised request of 4 January 2018; this is because she considered that the Appellant had appeared to accept the Council’s refusal to consider the original request. The Decision Notice outlines the evolution of the Appellant’s request and explicitly criticises the Council’s failures to provide appropriate advice and assistance. The Commissioner noted that she had explicitly declined to find that the Appellant’s request was vexatious for want of evidence, so she did not see how contacting him to clarify his motivations would have advanced his case beyond the conclusion that she had already come to. She asserted that she was not required to clarify anything with the Appellant if she considered there to be sufficient evidence upon which to ground a decision, and in any event, should it be considered that there is any breach of 9natural justice, this is remedied by a full rehearing before the Tribunal. The Tribunal’s powers are limited to the consideration of whether the Decision Notice was in accordance with the law, and there is no mechanism for the regulation or review of how an investigation was conducted. Ground IV – Request not manifestly unreasonable A public authority is not required to collate all the requested information before refusing a request under reg.12(4)(b), and the Commissioner had no reason to doubt the Council’s position after considering the sample minutes. APPELLANT’S REPLY: [10] Ground I – Factual Errors in the Decision Notice The Appellant asserted that the Council had failed to issue their refusals in compliance with the statutory requirements of either regime, and the Commissioner ought not to have accepted that they had done so. If the Council’s allegations about the Appellant’s motives were immaterial to the decision, he argued that they ought not to have been included in the DN. They were highly critical of the Appellant’s conduct, and he took great issue with not only their necessity but also their accuracy. He went to great lengths in his reply to refute the various allegations repeated by the Commissioner in the DN. The Commissioner also claimed that the Council had informed the Appellant in February 2018 that one of the reasons that the request would exceed the time and costs limits was because consent needed to be obtained for the release of information. The Appellant provided the communication in question, which showed that the Council never argued this. The Appellant cited the Code of Practice on the Discharge of Obligations of Public Authorities under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, referring to Part VII on Consultation with Third Parties. This statutory instrument makes it clear that while public authorities may commit to consult relevant third parties about disclosure, they are not obliged to do so and this does not relieve their obligations of disclosure under EIR. Ground II – Procedural unfairness 10The Commissioner asserted that in refusing the request on 23rd February 2018 the Council had cited EIR – this is not entirely correct. The refusal document does make reference to “regulation 12(5)(e) and 12(4)(e)” but nowhere in the document does it cite the Environmental Information Regulations by name, and the covering email with which it was sent confirmed to the Appellant that his request “has been dealt with under the Freedom of Information Act 2000”. It also did not cite cost as a factor for refusing the request. While accepting that in principle a party can rely on an exception or an exemption late in the process, the Appellant quoted extensively from APPGER v ICO and MoD [2011] UKUT 153 (AAC) to the effect that time and cost limits are not to be treated as other exceptions are, and must be taken early in the process to have any meaning: “[96]...Belated reliance on s12 is therefore inappropriate and inconsistent with the statutory purpose of protecting a public authority against the incurring of future unreasonable costs in meeting an information request. These costs have already been incurred.” The Appellant argued that it was a necessary implication that the Council had already done the work, hence its purported reliance on the various exceptions it initially cited prior to its reliance on reg.12 (4)(b). Ground III – Failures in the Commissioner’s investigation In finding that he had rejected the Council’s offer of a revised two year time request, the Appellant argued that the Commissioner had ignored the wording of his communications with the Council, in which he explicitly queried whether his revised request “has been reduced sufficiently to now be achievable”. Rather than an outright rejection, the Appellant understood this to be a process of dialogue about advice and assistance. It was the Council’s acceptance of the request without requesting or recommending further refinement that brought that process to a close, and it is therefore unfair to penalise the Appellant for the Council’s approach. Ground IV – Request not manifestly unreasonable 11The Commissioner’s assertion that the compilation of all material is unnecessary when an authority is relying on reg.12 (4)(b) does not apply in this instance, as the Council did indeed gather all the minutes subject to the revised request. It was inappropriate to take one sample as indicative, especially when the Council’s own case was that this particular sample contained entries in excess of the average contained in the others. The Appellant was concerned that the Commissioner had decided the public interest question separately to the consideration of the Council’s conduct in dealing with the request, especially when relying on the alleged burden it would place upon the Council without factoring in that the dialogue about narrowing the request was terminated by the Council. COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE: [11] The Commissioner declined to serve a response to the Appellant’s replies, save to cite McInerney v ICO and Dept for Education [2015] UKUT 0047 (AAC) to support the contention that s12 FOIA can indeed by raised at a late stage. TRIBUNAL FINDINGS and REASONS: [12] Although it does not appear to be an issue between the parties, the Tribunal agrees that EIR is the appropriate regime under which the Appellant’s request should be considered. The minutes of the meetings in question refer to plans and policies for dealing with land, and thus fall under the definition in Reg.2(1)(c). [13] We agree with the Commissioner that Mid Devon District Council breached Regulation 9 as it did not provide sufficient advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the public authority to do so. It is clear from the evidence that the Appellant was at all times prepared to negotiate with the Council. For example, having already restricted the scope of his request from fourteen to just five years, in his email of the 11th January 2018, timed at 10:06 (p.74), the Appellant enquires: “Can you please let me know whether… this request has been reduced sufficiently to now be achievable within the FOIA timeframe?” It was entirely open to the Council to respond to the Appellant, informing him that further reduction in scope would be necessary, but it did not do so. [14] The Tribunal were provided with the copy of minutes from the Capital Strategy and asset Management Group Meetings dated 12 March 2014. These are the 12minutes reviewed by the Information Commissioner in order to assess the accuracy of the time estimates provided by the Council. [15] The Tribunal considered that it would assist their deliberations if they viewed additional copies of relevant minutes. Case Management Directions were issued on the 28 May 2019 to join the Council as Second Respondent and to require all minutes of any meetings of the CSAG between 01 April 2017 until 03 November 2017 (the date of the request). We would then be able to test the Council’s claim that it would take 2.5 hours to review each set. [16] Having assessed the minutes provided, the Tribunal firstly noted that on average it took circa. six minutes to read one set. The Tribunal then noted, from the sequential minutes provided, that many items continued to be discussed from one meeting to the next. Consequently the status of each specific item under the ‘Key points discussed’ or ‘Actions’ columns’ was obvious; there would be no need therefore to separately review each item, taking account of the current situation, as claimed by the Council, particularly when starting to assess from the most recent minutes. [17] We found that, due to the way in which the minutes are written, any entries which may need to be redacted could easily be anonymised by removing the name or location of the site under consideration, which is often just a road name and town/village. In our view this is not an onerous and time-consuming task, particularly taking into account the fact that only a brief synopsis is provided in relation to each item discussed. [18] We noted that there was no reference to any additional reports or spreadsheets referred to in the minutes, apart from two relating to the Capital Programme for 2016/2017 and the Medium Term Financial Plan for 2017/18 – 2020/21. The Council has now published both these documents, although we are not able to determine the date of publication. [19] It follows that we find the Council’s assessment of the amount of time, it would take to process each set of minutes for disclosure, to be excessive. It seems to us that the minutes could easily be redacted at face value without the need for extensive background research as to arrangements, negotiations, discussions and so forth. Explanations of the redactions can be done on an exception-by-exception basis rather than individually for each item. We are satisfied that appropriate, fully justified redactions, could be applied consistently by knowledgeable staff, allowing 45 minutes per set, totalling circa.15 hours. As we find that this exception is not engaged, 13considerations of the public interest test therefore do not apply in this instance, as refusal to disclose was based on an erroneous reliance on an excessive estimate of the time required. As we now consider the request to be achievable within the hourly limit, it is our view that the Commissioner was incorrect to uphold the Council’s reliance on reg.12 (4)(b). and it seems to us has erred on the facts. For the reasons above, we allow the appeal, and direct the Council should reconsider the Appellant’s revised request and issue a fresh response, which cannot seek to rely on regulation 12 (4)(b). [20] We have not gone on to consider the propriety of any of the exceptions alleged by the Council throughout its initial dealings with the Appellant. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is limited to an assessment of the legality of the Commissioner’s Decision Notice, and reg.12 (4)(b) was the sole exception by which the refusal to disclose was upheld. [21] That being said, we acknowledge the Appellant’s disquiet in regards to the inclusion of the details of the Council’s allegations of vexatiousness in the DN. Importantly, the Appellant hotly disputes their accuracy; hence we make the Order (at [1] above) pertaining to publication subject to any final appeal process being exhausted.

"6","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2018/0250 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50721457 Dated: 4th October 2018 Appellant: Elisha Manasseh Respondent: The Information Commissioner Date of hearing: 13 March at Field House, London Date of decision: 2 May 2019 Before Anisa Dhanji Judge and Suzanne Cosgrave Pieter de Waal Panel Members Subject matter FOIA section 31(1)(g) - whether disclosure would or would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs; section 2(2)(b) whether in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure.IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2018/0250 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS DECISION The appeal is allowed. We direct that the Regulator of Social Housing must provide the disputed information (as defined in our decision), to the Appellant within 35 working days of this decision being promulgated. Except as set out above, the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is upheld. Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-Case No. EA/2018/0250 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Mr Elishah Manasseh (the “Appellant”), against a Decision Notice (“DN”), issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 4 October 2018. 2. It concerns a request (the “Request”), made by the Appellant for disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The Appellant wanted to know what information the Regulator of Social Housing (“RSH”) used, when deciding his complaint about his regulated social landlord, Selwood Housing (“Selwood”). 3. The RSH disclosed some information to the Appellant, but refused other information, citing various exemptions in FOIA. RSH’s Role 4. It may be helpful to begin by explaining what RSH does. The following summary is based on the Commissioner’s Response, which in turn, is drawn from explanations provided by RSH. It is not in dispute. 5. RSH is a statutory committee responsible for the regulation of social housing under section 92B of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (“HRA 2008”). It was formerly part of the Homes and Communities Agency (“HCA”), but became a separate entity from the HCA (now Homes England), on 1 October 2018. 6. RSH has two key statutory objectives, namely economic regulation, and consumer regulation. It has powers to set regulatory standards, and to monitor compliance with those standards. It also has enforcement powers, and a statutory duty to exercise its functions in a way that minimises interference, and is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable. 7. RSH has internal procedures which it operates to determine whether a registered provider of social housing has breached the relevant standards. Consumer matters are considered by a Consumer Regulation Panel (“CRP”), made up of representatives from different teams within the RSH. CRP is mandated to reach decisions about whether there may be a breach of the consumer standard and a serious detriment, as a precondition to certain actions on the part of the RSH in relation to consumer standards, and to determine whether or not a matter warrants further investigation. All decisions are recorded in the CRP notes to create an audit trail of its decisions. 8. RSH also undertakes reactive engagement work which falls outside its planned programme of engagement if there is reason to believe that a particular registered provider may be failing to meet an economic standard. -3-Details of the decisions taken by the RSH in the course of any reactive engagement are recorded in the Reactive Engagement Decision (“RED”) log. Background to the Request 9. On 17 July 2017 and 21 August 2017, the Appellant complained to RSH about Selwood. The RSH investigated the complaints and produced documents to assist in its investigation. These included CRP notes dated 3 August 2017 and 4 September 2017, a RED log dated 23 August 2017, and an email from an in-house solicitor dated 10 August 2010. 10. Amongst other things, the Appellant complained about the way Selwood’s accounts were presented, that a subsidiary had been set up in 2007 with only two directors, and without proper approval, and that Selwood had failed to provide information he had requested, including lists of company members, and details about certain processes. The specific complaints are more fully set out in the CRP notes dated 3 August 2017. 11. RSH considered the complaints. It concluded, however, that the relevant regulatory standards had not been breached. RSH communicated this to the Appellant on 20 September 2017. It also provided an explanation of the assessment it had carried out in relation to the relevant standards. 12. HCA carried out an internal review of the handling of the Appellant’s complaints by RSH. On 19 December 2017, it concluded that overall, the Appellant’s concerns had been properly considered by the regulator. The Appellant was informed that if he was not satisfied with this outcome, he could refer the matter to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. The Request 13. The Request, was made on 13 November 2017, on the following terms: Your organisation reviewed a complaint about my RSL [Registered Social Landlord] Selwood Housing. I wish to make a Freedom of Information Request and would be grateful of copies of all the information the regulator used when making is [sic] conclusions. 14. RSH replied on 5 January 2018. It released some information falling within the scope of the Request, namely incoming complaint referrals, papers RSH generated when considering the complaints, and two documents created for research purposes. RSH redacted certain information from this material in reliance on the exemptions in sections 31(1)(g), 40 and 42 of FOIA. It explained that some of the information redacted was the Appellant’s own personal data, which would be known to him, but had to be redacted because disclosure under FOIA was to the world at large. 15. RSH also withheld some information comprised within correspondence from the Appellant, the CRP notes dated 3 August 2017 and 4 September 2017, and the RED log. In so doing, RSH relied, in particular, on: -4-• section 40(1) in respect of the Appellant’s own personal data, and section 40(2) in respect of third party personal data. • section 31(1)(g), read with section 31(2)(c) (the law enforcement exemption) in respect of some information within the two CRP notes and RED log. 16. RSH also relied on section 42 (legal professional privilege), in respect of an email from an in-house solicitor dated 10 August 2017. However, RSH now relies on section 31(1)(g) in respect of this information. 17. At the Appellant’s request, RSH carried out an internal review of its response, but maintained its position. 18. Following the internal review, RSH explained, however, that some information which had been redacted was because that information did not fall within the scope of the Request. In addition, it explained that a small amount of information had been incorrectly redacted, and it released this to the Appellant. Complaint to the Commissioner 19. On 19 January 2018, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner. The Commissioner accepted the complaint on 10 April 2018, after RSH’s internal review had been completed. 20. The Commissioner then investigated the complaint. On 4 October 2018, she issued a DN, upholding RSH’s decision to withhold the disputed information. She found, inter alia, that RSH had correctly relied on the exemptions in section 40(1) and 40(2), as well as section 31(1)(g). 21. She also found that some information (comprising points for RSH to include in its response to the complaint), was not within the scope of the Request, which concerned information on how RSH made its decision. Appeal to the Tribunal 22. The Appellant has appealed against the DN under section 50 of FOIA. 23. His appeal is limited to the Commissioner’s findings in relation to section 31. He has not appealed against her findings in relation to section 40, and accordingly those findings are not in issue in this appeal. 24. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal from a DN is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the DN is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, she ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 25. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Decision Notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the -5-Commissioner, and indeed, as in this case, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. 26. The parties have lodged an agreed open bundle comprising some 455 pages and some further 40 pages lodged separately. In addition, we have been supplied with a closed bundle which includes the disputed information. 27. RSH has not been joined as a party, although we have considered its responses to the Commissioner’s investigations. 28. The parties have requested that this appeal be determined on the papers without an oral hearing. Having regard to the nature of the issues raised, and the nature of the evidence, we are satisfied that the appeal can properly be determined without an oral hearing. Disputed Information 29. We will refer to the information still withheld by RSH under section 31(1)(g) as the “disputed information”. 30. A number of the redactions have been made in respect of personal data of the Appellant or of third parties. Those redactions are not in dispute, and do not form part of the disputed information. 31. The information that has been identified as falling outside the scope of the Request (which the Appellant has not disputed), also does not form part of the disputed information. 32. The disputed information is relatively limited, in quantity, and in our view, also in significance. As already noted, it comprises some information within a CRP note dated 3rd August 2017, a CRP note dated 4th September 2017, and a RED log. 33. It also includes e mail correspondence in respect of which RSH had previously indicated that it was relying on section 42(1) (legal professional privilege), but which it has since said it is now relying on section 31(1)(g). The emails concern a chronology of various housing organisations’ registrations/de-registrations with the Housing Corporation, and relevant name changes. In particular, they concern the registration history of Selwood and its subsidiary Silcoa, with Companies House. 34. The closed bundle comprises some 29 pages. Pages 1 to 26 are unredacted versions of documents already provided to the Appellant. Pages 27 to 29 are the internal e mail correspondence referred to above. Statutory Framework 35. Under section 1 of FOIA, any person who makes a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed if the public authority holds that information, and if it does, to be provided with it. 36. The duty on a public authority to provide the information requested does not arise if the information is exempt under Part II of FOIA. -6-37. The exemptions are either “absolute”, meaning that there is no obligation to disclose the information, or “qualified” meaning that there is an obligation to disclose the requested information, unless “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” (section 2(2)(b)). This balancing exercise must be undertaken as at the date of the refusal. 38. As already noted, this appeal only concerns the exemption in section 31(1)(g). This is a “qualified” exemption. It is part of a series of exemptions under the broad heading of “law enforcement”. So far as relevant, it provides: (1) Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— … (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2) … (2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are— … (c) the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise… 39. This is a prejudice-based exemption. The public authority must show that in the event of disclosure, the prejudice specified in the exemption would, or would be likely to arise. These indicate different levels of likelihood. RSH has relied on the first limb, namely, would be likely to. The Parties’ Position The Commissioner 40. The Commissioner’s position is set out primarily in the DN, and in her Response to the Appellant’s grounds of appeal. 41. The Commissioner noted that RSH is formally tasked with ascertaining whether circumstances would justify regulatory action. The Commissioner considered that information held for that purpose falls within the scope of section 31(1)(g). 42. She accepted that disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to cause real and significant prejudice to RSH’s regulatory functions. In particular, the Commissioner found that RSH’s ability effectively to ascertain whether circumstances would justify regulatory action is dependent upon it being able to gather information, and correspond with providers and interested parties efficiently, whilst it looks into performance. Releasing the disputed information would allow other providers to see how RSH reaches its conclusions in complaint cases that are brought to it, for example, as to what intelligence it considers. It might also deter organisations from cooperating with RSH in the future. On this basis, the Commissioner accepted that disclosure would be likely to result in the prejudicial effect to RSH’s purposes -7-described in section 31(2)(c) of FOIA. She concluded, accordingly, that RSH had correctly applied the exemption. 43. The Commissioner then went on to consider the arguments put forward by RSH and the Appellant as to the public interest balance. The public interest in favour of disclosure is the need for transparency and accountability regarding how RSH carries out its functions. The public interest against disclosure is in ensuring that RSH’s regulatory functions are not prejudiced, in particular, that social housing providers perform to the standards set by the RSH, that the public have confidence in regulation, and that co-operation with RSH is not discouraged. The Commissioner also noted RSH’s position that a safe space was needed to consider and record its processes. 44. The Commissioner considered the Appellant’s concerns about Selwood Housing and RSH’s performance. However, she was not aware of any more widespread concerns about Selwood Housing or RSH. Such concerns might have tipped the balance in favour of disclosure. She noted that RSH had considered the complaint and disclosed some information to the Appellant associated with his complaint. She considered that this step, and other steps RSH takes (such as publishing reasons for its regulatory decisions in specific cases, as happened in this case, publishing reports on lessons learned, annual reviews, and a range of information about how it conducts its regulatory activity), satisfies RSH’s duty to be transparent. 45. On balance, and in the absence of any broader concerns about Selwood Housing, the Commissioner concluded that the public interest in favour of disclosure was outweighed by the public interest in favour of maintaining the exemption. The Appellant’s Position 46. In his grounds of appeal, the Appellant says that disclosure of the disputed information would not prejudice RSH in carrying out its regulatory functions within the meaning of section 31(2)(c), because RSH does not need co- operation from providers, given that it has powers to call for information from them. 47. He also says that there is no evidence to support the assertion that RSH needs a safe space to carry out its duties. He argues that other regulators, such as Ombudsmen and the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, do not require a safe space in which to operate. 48. He further says that the public interest test favours disclosure of the information because it is in the public interest to show how RSH’s regulatory process is carried out. Disclosure is necessary for public confidence in the system. Withholding the information does not allow confidence in the system, nor in its fairness. 49. He says that in this case, by refusing to disclose the information, RSH is covering up its incompetence. He further says that RSH has received other complaints and has dismissed every complaint. -8-50. He also says that without disclosure, he cannot address his concerns regarding RSH’s handling of his complaint, for example in any arbitration process. He says that the Commissioner did not address this point in the DN. Findings 51. As already noted, the Appellant has not appealed against the Commissioner’s findings in relation to section 40, and RSH is no longer relying on section 42. The Appellant has also not taken issue with the Commissioner’s finding that certain information falls outside the scope of the Request. 52. In his grounds of appeal, the Appellant takes issue with the way in which RSH handled his original complaint about Selwood Housing. However, the matters he raises in that regard fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and we make no findings about them. 53. The only issue properly before us concerns section 31(2)(c). Is the exemption engaged in relation to the disputed information? If so, does the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweigh the public interest in disclosure? We will consider these questions in turn. Is the exemption engaged? 54. The first question is whether section 31(2)(c), is engaged. Would disclosure be likely to prejudice the exercise, by RSH, of its functions for the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action by it, exist or may arise? 55. As the Commissioner points out in her Guidance Note on section 31, the exemption in 31(2)(c) is one of the more frequently claimed exemptions in section 31, reflecting the fact that many activities and sectors of the economy are subject to statutory regulation. Determining that a statutory requirement has been breached, compelling a breach to be remedied, or imposing fines or other sanctions, are all measures constituting “regulatory action”. There is no suggestion here that RSH is not empowered to take regulatory action; clearly it is. 56. Is the claimed prejudice made out? For the exemption to be engaged, disclosure of the disputed information must be likely to cause prejudice to the interest that the exemption protects. In the present case, this means prejudice to the ability of the regulator to determine whether any regulatory action should be taken. There must be a causal link between the disclosure and the prejudice. 57. It is not necessary to show that the prejudice would be significant (although the extent of the prejudice is relevant to the public interest balance). However, disclosing the information must have “a very significant and weighty chance” of causing prejudice that is “real, actual or of substance”: Hogan and Oxford City Council v the Information Commissioner (EA/2005/0026 and EA/2005/0030); Department for Work and Pensions v the Information Commissioner and FZ [2014] UKUT 0334 (AAC); and -9-R (Lord) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWHC 2073 (Admin). 58. The likelihood of prejudice must be based on the particular information in issue. It is not an exercise based simply on a generic factors. Those may be relevant, but the likelihood of prejudice must be borne out by the particular information in issue. 59. It has been argued that the disputed information would allow other providers to know how RSH reaches its conclusions in complaint cases that are brought to it. As already noted, the disputed information is relatively limited, in quantity and significance. We find it difficult to see how releasing the disputed information would be likely give rise to the claimed prejudice. In our view there is nothing unique about RSH’s processes in this regard, nor indeed has it been suggested that there is. RSH’s response to complaints, as indicated by its response to the Appellant’s complaint, suggests that it already discloses information about how it assesses a complaint. 60. It has also been argued that the disputed information would also allow other providers to know what intelligence RSH considers in dealing with complaints. However, the evidence before us indicates that such investigations as RSH carried out in this case were entirely desk based. There is no indication that RSH contacted Selwood; rather, it made its findings on the basis of whether the Appellant’s evidence supported his complaint. In finding that it did not, RSH gave the Appellant a detailed response. In our view, the disputed information does not add much to that that could be said to substantiate the claimed prejudice. 61. As to the claimed prejudice in terms of reducing cooperation from the providers RSH regulates or third parties, the Commissioner says, and we accept, that if RSH had to rely on formal investigatory powers in all cases, it would be inconsistent with its statutory duty to exercise its functions in a way that minimises interference and is proportionate. However, this is not a case in which RSH relied on cooperation. Also, while we recognise that cooperation is preferable, we consider that the fact that RSH has statutory powers it is able to exercise in the event of non-cooperation, would itself encourage cooperation. In short, we are not persuaded that disclosure would have a material or adverse effect on cooperation. 62. We are also not persuaded that disclosure would have the chilling effect claimed on information from providers and third parties because of fear on their part that any information provided would be released to the public. There is no evidence to indicate that either Selwood, or any other regulated social landlord, was asked for any information in relation to the Appellant’s complaint. That being the case, we cannot see how disclosure of the disputed information supports the chilling effect argument that RSH has made. 63. As to the argument that RSH needs a safe space in which to consider and record the information it holds about providers’ performance, and to be able to test arguments for and against regulatory action, free from scrutiny, those are not considerations that arise in the present case where the finding was that the Appellant’s complaint did not evidence any breach. That was a - 10 -decision that appears to have been reached entirely or largely on the basis of the complaint itself. 64. In short, we find there is a disconnect between the arguments made by RSH and the Commissioner, and the content of the disputed information. We do not consider that the evidence supports a finding that disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to result in the prejudice asserted. The Public Interest Balance 65. Having reached the finding that the likelihood of prejudice has not been made out, it is not necessary to go on to consider the public interest balance. Nevertheless, we will do so, albeit relatively briefly, for completeness and in case we are wrong about the exemption not being engaged. 66. In all the circumstances of the case, would the public interest in maintaining the exemption claimed by RSH outweigh the public interest in disclosure of the disputed information? 67. Under FOIA, there is, of course, no presumption in favor of disclosure. The burden lies on the public authority to establish that the harm that would likely be caused by disclosure of the information is such that it outweighs the considerations in favour of disclosure. 68. The correct approach to the application of the public interest balancing exercise, is set out in the Upper Tribunal’s decisions in APPGER v ICO and FCO [2013] UKUT 0560; Department of Health v Information Commissioner and Lewis [2015] UKUT 0159 (AAC); and Home Office v IC and Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law [2015] UKUT 0308 (AAC). The public interest balance must be undertaken by reference to specific public interest factors relating to the content of the information. This does not mean that generic factors are not relevant, but they need to be borne out by the particular information in issue. 69. As to the public interest in maintaining the exemption, the Commissioner considered that there was a very strong public interest in protecting the ability of the public authority to enforce the law. In our view, however, as already indicated, we do not consider that the nature of the disputed information in this case would compromise that ability in any material way. Indeed, there has been no evidence in the form of a witness statement from RSH or otherwise as to how disclosure of the disputed information would have that effect. 70. As to the public interest in disclosure, we agree with the Commissioner that the Appellant’s argument that disclosure would allow him to address his concerns about RSH’s handling of his complaint through a dispute resolution process, is primarily a private interest. In any event, we are not satisfied that the Appellant would be constrained in addressing his concerns about RSH’s handling of his complaint. RSH has provided the Appellant with a detailed explanation for finding that his complaint was not made out. If the Appellant submitted the dispute to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, or any other relevant body, it would be for RSH to respond to any allegations the - 11 -Appellant were to make. If it chose to do so without disclosing the relevant information, it would be for that body to take a view about that. 71. We also agree with the Commissioner that the comparison between the way RSH deals with complaints, and the Grenfell inquiry, for example, is misconceived. By its very nature, that inquiry is public, and is in no way comparable to RSH’s investigation of an individual complaint. 72. Nevertheless, we consider that there is clearly a public interest in disclosure. We agree with the public interest considerations set out by the Commissioner at para 58 of her Response. In brief, there is a public interest in decisions taken by the RSH on complaints being transparent to promote greater understanding of its decision making, and for the public to know whether such decisions are being properly made. This is particularly so, if as the Appellant claims (which has not been disputed), that there has been a trend of complaints made to RSH being dismissed. 73. If there was a greater public interest in maintaining the exemption, then the balance may well have been in favour of doing so. However, we consider that public interest to be limited, and although we do not regard the public interest in disclosure as being particularly strong, we find that it outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in this case. Decision 74. For all these reasons, we allow this appeal. 75. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge Date: 2 May 2019 - 12 -"
"7","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0086 Heard at Sheffield MC On 28 August 2018 Promulgation date 2nd May 2019 Before: JUDGE HOLMES ANNE CHAFER MALCOLM CLARK Between: LIAM HARRON Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS DECISION The Tribunal allows the appeal, and for the decision notice dated 28 March 2018 is substituted the following: The public authority is required, within 20 working days of receipt of this substituted Notice, to provide to the Appellant the information requested in his FOIA request of 6 April 2017, ref. No. 21 – 17. REASONS 1. In this appeal the Appellant, Liam Harron, appeals against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner on 28 March 2018, in which she determined that (save for delay in responding to the requests within the prescribed period) the public authority, Rotherham MBC 1(“RMBC”), had correctly applied s. 14(1) of the FOIA, on the grounds that the Appellant’s request was vexatious. 2. The appellant appealed the Decision Notice by a Notice of Appeal dated 24 April 2018. In his Notice the appellant indicated that he was content with a paper decision. 3. The Commissioner filed her response to the appeal on 7 June 2018. The Appellant filed a response to the Commissioner’s response dated 21 June 2018. The Commissioner too agreed to a paper hearing. 4. The Registrar issued case management directions on 11 May 2018 that this appeal, and that in EA/2018/0090, be considered together with two on -legal members. Whereas the Appellant had agreed to a paper hearing, on 21 June 2018 he withdrew that consent, and on 22 June 2018 the Registrar ordered that there be a hearing. 5. The Commissioner did not attend the hearing, but submitted written submissions in each appeal. RMBC was not made a party, and made no representations. Its responses to the ICO’s enquiries are contained in the bundles before the Tribunal. 6. The Appellant attended the hearing, and addressed the Tribunal. There was a Hearing bundle. To differentiate between references to the bundle before the Tribunal in linked appeals, the Tribunal will use the format “[0086/XXX]” to refer to page numbers in the bundle in this appeal. The Tribunal reserved its Decision, which is now given, with apologies to the parties for the delay in its promulgation, occasioned by a mixture of pressure of judicial business, technological issues, and family medical circumstances experienced by the Judge. 7. The Judge would, however, like respectfully to point out to the parties, particularly the party responsible for preparing the hearing bundles, which was presumably the ICO, that the Tribunal’s task has been made rather more difficult and time consuming than it need have been by the fact that each linked appeal has a separate bundle presented to the Tribunal. They all contain much the same material, and could, in hindsight, been reduced to one core bundle for all four linked appeals. As will be apparent, the Tribunal has, on occasion, had to resort to referring to documents contained in a bundle for one of the other appeals to fill the gaps in the bundle prepared specifically for this one. Where this has occurred the appropriate bundle reference number will be given in the same format. 8. It is further an unfortunate feature of the bundle in this appeal that the whole of section 9, the documents that the Appellant served with his response of 21 June 2018 is unpaginated. Where any of this material also 2appears (though it may be in redacted form) in the paginated section of the bundle, it will be referred to, but otherwise the Tribunal will only be able to reference it by identifying it in as being in section 9. 9. It is similarly unfortunate that the Appellant’s document entitled “FOIA Request made to Rotherham MBC on 16.9.15 – Summary of Chronology and Documents” authored by the Appellant on 25 May 2016, at pages [0086/18-19] has not been reproduced in the bundle for this appeal in its entirety, with attachments, as the Appellant has helpfully set out the history of his requests, using footnote annotations, which have not been included, and copy documents from 1 to 13b, and the responses of RMBC. That would have been a highly useful framework for the Tribunal to use, but it has not been replicated in full for its benefit. 10. Be that as it may, the Tribunal has, it considers been able to extract the necessary relevant facts and information from the documents supplied to it in the bundles. The Decision Notice. 11. The Decision Notice that is the subject of this appeal is dated 28 March 2018 (No. FS50703869). It this relates to the Appellant’s FOIA request of 6 April 2017, given the reference FOI 21 -17 by RMBC. 12. The Appellant approached the ICO about the request on 11 October 2017 [0086/60 - 64]. In his complaint he stated that he considered that the denial of the requested information was part of a wider context of an attempt to deny him other related information. The Background. 13. The background to the FOIA request in question, and those which preceded it is as follows. 14. The Appellant is a retired headteacher. In the aftermath of serious Child Sexual Exploitation (“CSE”) in Rotherham, which led to the publication in August 2014 of the Jay Report into CSE in Rotherham between 1997 to 2013, he and a colleague Chrissy Meleady, saw a need to give victims, survivors and their families a voice, to assist them in dealing with their experiences, and to help inform the establishment of systems and procedures that would gain support of those directly affected by CSE. 15. Consequently, the Appellant and Chrissy Meleady between November 2014 and February 2015 received and compiled contributions from victims, and others affected by CSE, and on 15 February 2015 published them in a 44-page A4 softback booklet, entitled “Voices of Despair 3Voices of Hope” (hereinafter “Voices”). The Tribunal was provided with a copy of the publication, a copy of which is also enclosed in section 9 of the bundle. The Appellant and Ms Meleady worked in close consultation with RMBC and South Yorkshire Police in the production of this work. David McWilliams was appointed in January 2015 as Director of Commissioning and Performance for Children and Young People’s Services at RMBC. The Appellant consulted with him during production of the publication. 16. The Appellant funded the production of Voices himself. It was not intended to be a commercial product. The initial production run of the publication was 500 copies. 17. On 10 March 2015 RMBC ordered 1500 copies of Voices. This was unexpected, and the Appellant had to arrange increased production to meet this order. It was anticipated that RMBC would distribute the publication. 18. The 1500 copies were produced and delivered to RMBC in or around March 2015. The Appellant kindly provided the Tribunal with a hard copy of the publication at the hearing. 19. Around February 2015 RMBC the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government exercised his powers to suspend the Council, and its functions were thereafter carried out by Commissioners, appointed by the Secretary of State. Accordingly, ultimate control of RMBC functions lay in the hands of these Commissioners, and it was to them that RMBC officers reported from February 2015. 20. On 24 July 2015 the Appellant, Chrissy Meleady and David McWilliams met. By then the latter had been appointed Assistant Director Early Help & Family Engagement, but he re-affirmed RMBC’s intention to distribute the publication through a planned workforce distribution programme, likely to commence that autumn. 21. On 5 September 2015 far right - wing activists came to hold a demonstration in Rotherham, seeking to exploit the fact that the perpetrators of the CSE that had been uncovered were from ethnic minority groups. This had led to clashes with the Police and anti-fascist groups who had demonstrated against the right - wing groups. 22. Against this background, and to promote racial harmony, the Appellant, still working with Chrissy Maleady, proposed a second edition of the publication, in which he hoped to defuse racial tensions, and to present a more conciliatory approach, to bring together communities. He was concerned that racism was now becoming as big a problem in 4Rotherham as CSE had been, and the purpose of the next edition of Voices would be to listen to the voices of victims, survivors, and their family members and others adversely and directly affected by racism. 23. He therefore sent an e-mail [section 9 of the bundle] to David McWilliams and Ian Thomas, the Strategic Director of Children and Young People’s Services at RMBC, on 11 September 2015 impressing upon them that the second edition of Voices was now a very high priority for himself and Chrissy Maleady. In that email he also asked for a breakdown of the distribution of the 1500 copies of the original publication that had been supplied to RMBC. 24. On 15 September 2015 David McWilliams replied in an email to the Appellant. He summarised the distribution of Voices up to that point, which was around a couple of boxes. In that email, however, he informed the Appellant of RMBC’s decision not to distribute the first edition of Voices any further. He explained this decision in these terms in his email: “However, before I took this any further we sought independent, expert guidance on the content and after consideration Commissioner Newsam and Ian [Thomas] agreed to keep any further distribution limited to those already mentioned and or any individuals that we felt should be sighted on the publication. 25. He went on: “I thought you might find it helpful if I shared some of the feedback we received:” 26. David McWilliams then set out some seven paragraphs of issues that RMBC apparently had with the publication, which were the reasons that the decision had been taken not to distribute it any further. The full text of this email is in section 9 of the bundle, although extracts from it are quoted in several other documents. The first two paragraphs are in Arial font, but the text of seven paragraphs which followed the words “. the feedback we received:” are in italic, until the end of the email, where the sign – off “Best wishes. Dave” reverts back to Arial, non – italic, font. 27. The Appellant replied to him by email later the same day expressing his concern at the change in position. He asked whether there had been any positive feedback. Later the same day Chrissy Meleady wrote an extensive (four and a half pages in print) email in which she addressed the issues that he had raised, and effectively seeking to rebut the negative feedback, particularly by reference to distribution issues, where she argued that some of the concerns expressed could have addressed by selected distribution to professionals and other bodies, 5with suitable accompanying material to address some of the issues raised. 28. The Appellant on 16 September 2015 raised his first FOIA request to RMBC in these terms: “The email from David McWilliams yesterday about Voices of Despair, Voices of Hope is both baffling and distressing. I think it is essential, for the public record, to get to the bottom of all the mistakes that have been made. As a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request, I am asking for a copy of all communications relating to Voices of Despair, Voices of Hope from 2 December 2014 up to 16 September 2015.” 29. The actual document making this request does not appear to be included in this bundle (though it might be), but the terms of the request are repeatedly quoted in many other documents [e.g. page 0086/54]. This was the beginning of the Appellant’s attempts to obtain an explanation of why RMBC, having purchased 1500 copies, had changed its mind about distributing so many copies of Voices, with no warning that this was likely to happen. His reasons for seeking this explanation were, he told the Tribunal, which it accepts, that he felt in a difficult position in relation to those who had contributed to Voices, who had been led to believe that RMBC would be widely distributing it, and who could perceive this decision as a yet further instance of not being listened to by the establishment, one of the central issues in the CSE affair that the publication of Voices was intended to address. 30. This request was given the internal reference no. by RMC of FOI 600. This, of course, would be of 2015. The request of 16 September 2015 was also given the reference FOI 714, but this was clearly at a later stage. Confusion as to allocation of numbers to requests has been apparent throughout these appeals. 31. RMBC responded to that request on 23 October 2015 (outside the time limit, but nothing turns on that). The Appellant was provided with some copy documents, but did not consider that his request had been adequately responded to, so he sought, on 26 October 2015, and again on 7 December 2015, a review of the information provided to him under this Request. In this particular request of 26 October 2015 [0086/107 – 108] the Appellant had requested, at part 3: “Information sent out with the Voices of Despair Voices of Hope publication to those taking part in any appraisal or evaluation.” 6He also asked, at part 4, for: “... the information generated when processing this FOI request (the metadata) which includes the internal notes, emails etc...” In this document he set out 5, non – exhaustive, categories of documents which he considered should be disclosed. It appears to be at this stage that this was treated as a new request and given the reference FOI 714 see [0086/107]. 32. RMBC did not treat this as a review, but as a request for clarification. It responded by letter of 19 November 2015 informing the Appellant that it was being so treated, and that he would receive a further response by 23 November 2015. In fact, he received a further response on 7 December 2015, when he was supplied with further information. Try as it might, the Tribunal has been unable to find the actual response sent to the Appellant in the bundle, although a draft of it appears at [0086/121 – 124] It is, however, clear that the Appellant did receive this on 7 December 2015 further information, because that day he made a request for a review of the response he had received. 33. Further, he responded to it in a document entitled “Comments on the information received on Monday 7 December 2015” dated 15 December 2015. It is, however, unclear precisely what the Appellant received, other than a request for further clarification of three areas of six that he had previously referred to. From subsequent documents it appears that he was given the information that two copies of the Voices publication were sent to the “expert”, with an explanation about why an independent review was being sought. 34. The further information that the Appellant received appears to have been that which had been provided in draft to Commissioner Manzie for comment, and was sent then to Jean Imray for further comment before being released to the Appellant. 35. The Appellant also on 7 December 2015 had sought a review of his request, in the sense of his original request, which he considered had not yet been dealt with. It is clear, however, that in that email he used the reference number 714, the one assigned by RMBC in response to what had been his review request of 26 October 2015. 36. Linton Steele, a solicitor with RMBC, was appointed by RMBC to undertake an internal review on or about 11 December 2015. He conducted that review, and sent the results to the Appellant on or about 15 January 2016. His review document is at not in this bundle 737. It is, however, contained in the bundle for another appeal, at [0090/148 – 155]. It is erroneously dated 15 January 2015 on the last page. This is entitled FOI – 714 – Internal Review Decision, but Mr Steele acknowledges that there has been some confusion over assigned FOI request numbers, and refers to FOI 600 as well. He reviewed the information that had been provided to the Appellant on 23 October 2015, and the Appellant’s response to it of 26 October 2015, which was treated as further clarification of his original request, though also assigned number 714 by RMBC. 38. He confirmed his provisional view, expressed to the Appellant on 17 December 2015, that RMBC had indeed failed to comply with the Appellant’s request, within the statutory deadline, and substantively, in that RMBC had not provided the Appellant with, at the very least, a copy of the “expert appraisal” as it was termed that the Appellant had asked for. 39. He went on, however, [0090/150 - 151] to set out the results of his enquiries with Jean Imray, the Interim Deputy Strategic Director of CYPS. He relayed her account of how she had received the expert opinion by telephoning a sexual violence practitioner, and had asked for his or her comments on the Voices publication. This person agreed to provide comment, but on the strict basis that he or she would not be identified. 40. Jean Imray had explained to Linton Steele how these comments had been received by her on her personal iPad device, and how she then forwarded the same to herself at her RMBC email address. This was on 2 August 2015, and Linton Steele included in his Internal Review document the email of 2 August 2015 that Jean Imray had sent to herself [0090/151 - 153]. 41. Linton Steele went on to consider whether non - disclosure of the identity of the expert who had provided these comments would be justified under the statutory exemptions under s.40(2) and 41 of FOIA. He concluded that disclosure would not be just and lawful, and that the absolute exemption under s.40(2) was engaged. Nothing in this appeal challenges that view. 42. The Appellant thus received, by way of this Review, more information, and became aware, he says for the first time, of Jean Imray’s involvement, what information she received, and how she had received it. 843. The Appellant emailed Jean Imray directly on 15 January 2016 to ask her some further questions. She, by email of 15 January 2016 [0086/133] told Linton Steele, and others in RMBC that she had no intention of replying to the Appellant. 44. On 18 January 2016 the Appellant made his next FOIA request. In was in these terms: “Please can I have a copy of all communications about Voices of Hope following the meeting with David McWilliams on 5 March 2015 up to Fiona Radford’s email of 10 March and any subsequent communication relating to Voices of Despair Voices of Hope up to and including 26 March 2015” 45. This was allocated number 989 by RMBC. 46. On 29 January 2016 Kelly Harrison of RMBC sent an email to a number of RMBC colleagues, including Jean Imray and David McWilliams, referred to the Appellant’s FIO request no. 714, and asking for all information generated (the metadata) generated when processing the first FOI request. After some initial querying as to whether this had not already been done, it was confirmed as being outstanding, but Jean Imray said on 31 January 2016 that she was pretty sure this had been done and she had nothing to add [0047/86-87]. 47. On 14 March 2016 the Appellant received a response to this request. It revealed that a meeting of the Directorate Leadership Team (“DLT”) had been held on 9 March 2015, at which the decision to purchase Voices was made, attended by David McWilliams and Ian Thomas. The Appellant considers that this was information that should have been included in the response to his first FOIA request of 15 September 2015. 48. On 16 May 2016 the Appellant received further information from RMBC. Amongst this were copies of email exchanges on 14 September 2015, including one of that date from David McWilliams. That was very similar to the one he sent to the Appellant on 15 September 2015, but it contained additional wording, in that between the words “However, before I took this any further and “independent , expert guidance on the content and after consideration Commissioner Newsam and I...” there appeared the words: “.. I shared this with DLT and it was agreed we should seek some......” 49. This was therefore slightly different wording from that used in the email sent to the Appellant on 15 September 2015, and suggested that the matter had been discussed at the DLT. 950. On 15 August 2016 the Appellant received redacted minutes of that meeting. 51. Ultimately, after further activity in 2016, the Appellant made a further request, dated 30 September 2016, which was in four parts. It is to be found at [0009/46-47]. In part 3 the Appellant recited the first paragraph of David McWilliams’ email to him of 15 September 2015, and the reference to the feedback on the Voices publication that then ensued. He went on to refer to a document sent to the ICO on 25 May 2016. He then made this request: “Please can I have a copy of any email exchanges led to David McWilliams receiving the so – called independent expert guidance. If there are no email exchanges, please can an explanation be provided as to how David McWilliams received the so-called expert guidance.” 52. This request (i.e all of it) was given the reference number 740-16 by RMBC. RMBC’s response, dated, if only by a handwritten note, 1 November 2016, is (for the first time) contained in the 0009 bundles at pages [0009/49 – 50]. 53. In their response RMBC responded to part 1 of the request by referring to an email provided to the Appellant on 3 October 2016, to part 2 by referring to the Appellant’s three previous FOIA requests, referenced as 600, 714 and 989, and the email exchanges disclosed pursuant to those requests, and, in response to part 4 by reference to a response from RMBC sent to the Appellant on 16 May 2016, and to a meeting held between the Appellant and RMBC on 18 July 2016. 54. In response to part 3, RMBC again referred to the disclosure made in response to the three previous FOIA requests referred to, and went on to say: “No further information is held.” 55. By letter of 23 December 2016 [0009/51 – 52] the Appellant sought an internal review. In relation to part 2 of his request, he said: “There is already overwhelming evidence of how the response to the first ever FOIA Request I submitted to RMBC on 16.9.15 (600) was totally inadequate. To date there is strong evidence that no one in RMBC has shown any serious intent to get to the complete truth. Yesterday I received: SAR 242 – Liam Harron – Information from Rotherham MBC. This has provided further evidence of evasion, procrastination and dishonesty by officers of RMBC 10On page 63, under Q3, there is reference to an email from Jean Imray: ........ subsequently forwarded from her RMBC account to Ian Thomas on 4/8/15 This email should have been provided as part of my first FOIA request on 16.9.15 and directly relates to part 2 in my FOIA Request on 30.9.16. It clearly shows that information has been withheld. The nature of that information indicates that it has been deliberately withheld. 56. That, however, it should be noted, relates to part 2 of his request, not part 3. In relation to part 3, the Appellant said this: “The same applies to part 3 in my request on 30.9.16, namely: [the request is repeated] and he added: “I believe there is overwhelming evidence of dishonesty here.” 57. At the Appellant’s request, RMBC provided carried out an internal review of the response to request 740-16. It provided the Appellant with its response, which is unhelpfully undated, but appears to have been prepared on 2 February 2017 [0086/105 – 106]. In relation to part Question 2, in which the Appellant had complained that email exchanges he had been provided with should have been provided as part of the response to his first FOIA request on 16 September 2015, the outcome provided was: “The information was part of a 3-page email thread and was a forwarding on email header, the information it contained was the sender’s and the recipient’s name together with the date and heading. The content of the emails before and after this header have been disclosed to you in previous responses. This information was not withheld intentionally and Rotherham had no reason to exempt this from disclosure. The reason for the non – disclosure was human error.” 58. The same day as he received this Review of his request 740-16, 2 February 2017, the Appellant made a further request, which was given reference number 1124-16 by RMBC. 59. RMBC apparently (for the Tribunal cannot find a copy in the bundle for this appeal) on 16 February 2017, as required by s.17(5) of FOIA a notice 11to the Appellant that it was relying upon s.14 FOIA to exempt it from the requirement to provide the information requested. 60. The Appellant then referred the matter to the ICO by letter of 5 April 2017 (0086/125-126). In that letter he set out the history of his FOIA requests to RMBC from 16 September 2015 onwards. Whilst he made reference to all the requests he had made, he made it clear that the purpose of his letter was to ask the IC to ask RMBC: “... for an explanation as to how officer David McWilliams received what on 15.9.15 he referred to as “feedback” from a so-called (but still unnamed) “independent expert”. In an email on 15.9.15 David McWilliams included what appeared to be a long extract from information he had received, either directly or from a colleague at RMBC. However, RMBC state that David McWilliams did not receive this information by email. In my strong view there is very strong evidence that David McWilliams received this information by email and there is evidence that David McWilliams does not want to reveal the contents of this email.” 61. He went on to provide the ICO with some documents, setting out his previous requests, and the responses, and internal reviews, of RMBC to them. 62. In conclusion, he said this: “In summary, there remains a further critical piece of information that I believe has been withheld by RMBC – that of how David McWilliams received what he referred to in his email of 15.9.15 as “feedback” from the so-called (but still unnamed) independent expert.” He reiterated his request for the ICO to ask RMBC for an explanation. 63. On 6 April 2017 the Appellant made a further request of RMBC, in these terms. Firstly, he recited the email from David McWilliams of 14 September 2015, referred to at para. 47 above. The terms of his request, which is at [0086/50] were, after he recited the contents of the email of 14 September 2015: “This FOI Request is for a copy of any information relating to the highlighted comment ‘I shared this with DLT and it was agreed that we should seek some independent, expert guidance on the content.’ DLT stands for Departmental Leadership Team.” 1264. It is this request which is the subject of this appeal. It was given reference number 21 – 17, and was considered by the ICO to be the sixth FOIA request made by the Appellant. 65. Marie Buxton, head of Information Management of RMBC responded further to this request on 8 June 2017, [0086/51 – 52]. This was in fact a document with two purposes, for it responded to the Appellant’s request for a review of the Refusal Notice dated 16 February 2017, but, more pertinently for this appeal, it responded to the Appellant’s FOI Request of 6 April 2017, referred to as 21-17. In fact, the previous Refusal Notice of 16 February 2017 was withdrawn, as it was not in response to a request under FOIA. The Appellant’s request of 6 April 2017, however, was, and that was thereby refused under s.14 of FOIA. 66. The response was that the request had been deemed vexatious under section 14(1) of FOIA. Marie Buxton went on say that RMBC had evidence that the appellant’s past behaviour suggested that a response would only serve to encourage follow up requests. She cited the ICO guidance on Dealing with Vexatious Requests, and under the heading “Frequent or overlapping requests”, she went on to refer to the six FOI requests that the appellant had made since September 2015, and the internal reviews that had been carried out when requested. RMBC had evidence of frequent and overlapping requests. The Appellant was informed of his right t seek a review of this refusal. 67. The Appellant duly did seek an internal review by letter of 14 August 2017 [0086/54]. In it he said (his emphasis): “I believe it is self – evident that I should have been provided the information I requested on 6.4.17 as a response to my FOI request on 16.9.15”. 68. He went on to suggest that the response that his request was vexatious provided evidence of “significant incompetency by the decision maker.” 69. The response to the Internal Review by RMBC was (apparently, for it is only hand dated, and is not attributed to any author) provided on 13 September 2017 [0086/55-58]. The findings on the review were that there had been frequent and overlapping requests made by the Appellant, and the refusal was upheld. 70. The Appellant referred the matter to the ICO by letter of 11 October 2017 [0086/60]. He enclosed various documents, and ended his letter by stating that he believed the denial of the requested information was part of a wider context to deny him other related information, which he asked the ICO to take into account. 1371. The ICO assigned case reference no. FS50703869 to the complaint, and contacted RMBC on 27 October 2017. 72. There was then some delay in the complaint being investigated, but on 1 February 2018 Deborah Clark notified the Appellant and RMBC that she was the case officer. She asked Marie Buxton on behalf of RMBC to supply further information as to why the Appellant’s request had been deemed to be vexatious [0086/70-73], asking her in particular to address: • Details of the detrimental impact of complying with the request; • Why this impact would be unjustified or disproportionate in relation to the request itself and its inherent purpose or value; • And, if relevant, details of any wider context and history to the request if the council believes that this background supports application of section 14(1). Please provide any relevant documentary evidence/background evidence to support such a claim. • Please ensure the above includes details of the 6 previous FOI request relating to the subject of this request, including whether such requests were responded to in full in a timely manner. 73. She also asked Marie Buxton to provide comments on the Appellant’s assertions that: • There are significant gaps in the information that has been provided in response to the first request dated 16.09.15 and each of his requests since then have been a follow up to the ‘inadequate’ response to his first request. • He believes that information was, and still is being, deliberately withheld. • His request on 26.10.15 for “Information sent out with the Voices of Despair Voices of Hope publication to those taking part in any appraisal or evaluation” received the response “Two copies of the document were sent with an explanation about why an independent view was being sought” but this was proved to be an untrue statement when the council stated that “no explanation about why an independent view was being sought”. • The council has refused to reveal the identity of the “independent expert” and no original information has been provided to show that this person event exists. 74. On 1 March 2018 Marie Buxton provided the ICO with her responses to the ICO’s letter of 1 February 2018 [0086/89 – 93]. In this document Marie Buxton replied to each bullet – pointed query, giving it a number. 14Under 1, “Details of the detrimental impact of complying with the request” she referred to the response to the Appellant’s request within FOI 600 given on 23 October 2015, and then the “follow up response on 16 May 2016.” 75. Under 1.2, where details of the detrimental impact of complying with frequent and overlapping requests were sought, Marie Buxton referred to the disproportionate amount of RMBC officer time spent in attempting to satisfy the Appellant, his persistence that additional information was held, and how officer need to spend their time dealing with the large number of legitimate requests. She went on to refer to the Appellant’s accusations of dishonesty by Council Staff. 76. Under 2, why the impact of the request would be unjustified or disproportionate, she said that pursuing this line of enquiry would serve no further purpose or value to the public. 77. In answer to point 3, which asked for details of any wider context and history to the request if the council believes that this background supports application of section 14(1), Marie Buxton referred to the previous 6 requests relation to the same subject that RMBC had responded to. She went on to explain how RMBC had sought clarification of some requests, and the Appellant’s contact after receiving what he considered were inadequate responses. She went on the suggest that in hindsight RMBC should have logged these as further FOIA requests, as not within the original request. She conceded that due to the “complex nature and breadth” of some requests, RMBC did struggle to meet the statutory timescales. She also suggested that RMBC, again in hindsight ought to have applied the cost limit exemption in some instances. 78. She also made reference to the BAU arrangements, and the Appellant’s requests thereunder. She attached [0086/85 – 88] a copy of the document in which questions posed by the appellant were set out as part of this process, and the responses. She pointed out that these were repeat questions. 79. Under section 4, where RMBC is asked to comment upon the Appellant’s assertions, the response was firstly that it is not accepted that the responses to FOI were inadequate. Comment is then made about the BAU approach, and the contention was made to the overlapping/repeat nature of some of the requests, and the referral by RMBC to previous responses to previous requests. 80. Reference was then made to the availability of internal review. This section then contains this comment [0086/92]: 15“The Council appreciates that on some Internal Reviews further information may have been identified, however this could have been avoided if the Council sought clarification of the complex information requests.” 81. Marie Buxton then went on to refute any suggestion that information was, and was still, being deliberately withheld, and referred to the additional attempt at a BAU approach. 82. The remaining comments relate to the identification of the “independent expert”. 83. Thereafter, Marie Buxton submitted more material to the ICO. This appears to have been by email of 6 March 2018 [0086/97], to which a Briefing document, dated on its face 1 March 2017, but upon which a handwritten annotation “6 March 2018” has been added was attached [0086/98 – 102]. 84. This document does two things. It sets out a chronological background of the requests, the responses and the internal reviews, and also sets out, under various headings, RMBC’s further submissions in support of its contention that this request is vexatious. Those headings are: Aggressive Tone Burden on the authority Personal grudges Unfounded accusations Scattergun approach No obvious intent to obtain information 85. Reference is then made [0086/101] to an online Petition submitted by the Appellant on 14 July 2017, in which the Appellant, and any signatories, called upon Sharon Kemp, the Chief Executive of RMBC to write to all employees of RMBC to impress upon them the importance of truthfulness in their communications with representatives and advocates of victims and survivors of CSE in Rotherham. Reference is made in this Petition to an email from the Rotherham Truth Campaign of 30 June 2017 in which there was an allegation of dishonesty involving RMBC officers and commissioners. 86. The Appellant wrote further to the ICO on 21 March 2018 [0086/127] making reference to his previous complaint relating to the internal review of request 740-16, which he had referred to the ICO. He submitted more material on 22 March 2018 [0086/132], namely emails from RMBC received on 22 November 2016. 1687. The IC issued her Decision Notice on 28 March 2018, in short, accepting largely RMBC’s grounds for holding that the request fell within the exemption of vexatious requests in s.14(1) of FOIA. Reference is made to the previous requests, how they have been dealt with and subsequently considered by the ICO, the burden on the authority, and the limited value in consuming yet further public resources in responding to this request. 88. The Appellant appealed on 4 January 2018. The Law. 89. Section 14(1) of FOIA provides: “Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious.” In terms of the caselaw, the ICO’s submissions set out extensive extracts from the caselaw, particularly The Information Commissioner v Devon CC & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440, and the Court of Appeal judgment in the same proceedings, and Colin Parker v. Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 0427, which it is not intended to repeat here. The Tribunal accepts that these passages accurately reflect the law on how section 14(1) is to be applied, the Tribunal would highlight the following principles are established in determining whether a request falls to be considered vexatious within the meaning of s.14(1): • A holistic and broad, or rounded, approach must be taken to the issue; • Whilst motive on the part of the requester was not directly relevant, the history of past requests, and a previous course of dealings between the request and the authority were relevant considerations; • The starting point is to consider whether the request has no reasonable foundation, that there was no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value; • That is not, however, determinative, as, even if the information was important and potentially in the public interest, if the request for it was made by a vengeful requester, it could still be vexatious to request it; • The hurdle of satisfying the test of vexatiousness is a high one. 90. Applying those tests to the facts before us, a number of factors are apparent. Firstly, there is clearly nothing abusive or vengeful in the particular request that the Appellant made. It was in simple, temperate terms, and, as with all his dealings with the authority, he has used polite and civil modes of communication. Secondly, whilst he had, it is 17true suggested previously that information had been deliberately withheld, and that there had been dishonesty, he does not repeat that allegation in this request. Further, other than to make that suggestion, he has not imputed any other form of particular improper motive or misconduct on the part of the authority, he has simply continued to press for information which he believed, and probably still believes, exists and should be disclosed. 91. This Tribunal accepts, as is manifestly correct, that previous requests are highly relevant. There is, of course, no magic number whereby a requester runs the risk of a finding of vexatiousness because his requests exceed that number, but it is of some concern to this Tribunal that the authority has on a number of occasions referred to the Appellant as having made six previous requests. This is not strictly accurate. By the time of the request under appeal on 6 April 2017 he had, in fact, made five. RMBC had not, however, treated these consistently, and there are issues with the reference numbers that were assigned to them, but they accepted and dealt with five, not six. The IC appears to have understood this, as she refers to five previous requests. 92. It is also to be noted that in its response to the ICO, RMBC suggests that in hindsight it ought to have treated the Appellant as having made more requests than it had done, as it considered that some of his further requests fell outside the scope of his previous requests. The converse of this, however, the Appellant argues, is that information was not provided that should have been, or at the time that it should have been, but was released piecemeal. An example of this is the 14 September 2015 email from David McWilliams, which was not provided pursuant to his first request of 16 September 2015, and only emerged on 16 May 2016. The Appellant’s point is that this should not have required a further request, but was what should have been provided from the outset. 93. Thus, whilst the Tribunal accepts fully that the Appellant’s previous requests are highly relevant, so too must be the responses to them. A further relevant consideration, therefore, the Tribunal considers, is the concession, made in the Internal Review of Request 740-16 of 2 February 2017 [0086/105] that some information was not provided when it should have been “due to human error”. It is also of relevance, the Tribunal considers, that this Review document also enclosed further emails, which, it seems implicit, should also have been provided in response to the Appellant’s previous request or requests. 94. RMBC’s contentions to the ICO were that the Appellant’s requests under FOIA were related to his “dissatisfaction” with the authority’s decision not to purchase significant numbers of Voices. RMBC also 18contended that the request (i.e this one) has been made “in order to express anger at the Council’s decision”. Further, the ICO’s approach to this case seems to us to imply that the Appellant was aggrieved at the decision of RMBC not to purchase the number of copies of “Voices” that it had said it would, as if he were some type of commercial supplier. Para. 36 of the ICO’s Decision Notice refers to it being reasonable for her to conclude that there was no “known requirement for the Council to publish the Book, and that any business decision to do so rests with the Council”. 95. With respect to the ICO, she misses the point. The Appellant’s concerns are not “business” concerns, nor was he dissatisfied with the decision from a business point of view. RMBC did in fact purchase 1500 copies of Voices, what it changed its mind about was whether to distribute them. What the Appellant has sought has been an explanation from RMBC as to why it changed its mind. He has done so not from personal “dissatisfaction”, but from his sense of obligation to those who contributed to the publication in good faith, and with raised expectations that their “voices” would indeed be heard, whose expectations were then dashed, leading some of them to feel that they had yet again not been listened to. That, this Tribunal finds, has always been the Appellant’s motivation, and purpose of all his requests. 96. His contention that there has, or may have been, dishonesty on the part of RMBC officers, or others, is not a wild allegation, made from the beginning, but one that has been his reaction to the piecemeal, and as he sees it, less than satisfactory manner in which information has been released in response to his requests. He does not assert any improper motives such as personal gain or greed, merely that there has been less than open and frank disclosure. 97. That, of course, does not mean that this is not a vexatious request, but it is important, if a holistic and rounded approach is to be taken, to put this request in context. 98. This request is said to be significantly similar to previous requests, and the Tribunal agrees that it is, but it is highly specific, and relates solely to the information, which the Appellant did not receive until 2016, pertaining to the DLT when David McWilliams apparently discussed the issue of Voices with them. This is thus not a wide-ranging request, but is highly specific, and arises out of information that the Appellant only received long after his initial FOI request. Further, whilst it is true that the Appellant made requests that there were overlapping requests, the Tribunal considers that this was only necessary because of the failure of RMBC to provide in full the information sought in previous requests, a point made forcibly by the Appellant. 1999. Further, the Tribunal considers that RMBC’s response document of 1 March 2018 [0086/89-93] is somewhat mealy – mouthed. In section 4.1, for instance, the concession is made that on some Internal Reviews further information “may have been identified”, but then this is excused or explained by the need for clarification of the “complex information requests” 100. Firstly, there is no “may have” about it. It is clear that further information was provided on Internal Review. In one instance, the review of request 740-16, on 2 February 2017, resulted, 4 months or more after the request was made, in the release of emails passing between the Interim Deputy Strategic Director following amendments made by Commissioner Manzie, and an email header not provided in response to the requests made in September and October 2015, because of “human error”. Additionally, in Linton Steele’s Internal Review of January 2016 further information was disclosed. The Tribunal notes that despite the Appellant’s references to it, and inclusion in various documents he has submitted, a copy of this particular review does not appear in the bundle for this appeal at all. 101. Further, the Tribunal would like to address the oft – repeated assertion by RMBC that the Appellant’s requests were “complex”. They were not. They were often no more than a paragraph. Their subject matter encompasses a relatively short timescale, from March 2015 to October 2015, and a single issue, what was the reason that RMBC decided not to distribute the 1500 copies of Voices that it had purchased? The information that the Appellant has been seeking is simply who took that decision and why? Any complexity that has arisen, it seems to the Tribunal has arisen because of the piecemeal and unsatisfactory manner in which information has been elicited from RMBC. This has inevitably led to a train of further enquiry. RMBC can hardly complain when the Appellant raises a further request because a piece of information that it has disclosed suggests that there may be more information that has not been disclosed. 102. The Tribunal has considered the ICO’s reasoning at para. 41 of the Decision Notice, wherein she makes reference to her determination of a similar request, to the effect that no such information was held. She argues that this lessens the public value in the request being complied with. That may be so, but the Tribunal’s concern is that the Commissioner is thereby seeking to determine vexatiousness of the request in the light of subsequent events. To that end, the Tribunal considers that the online Petition of 14 July 2017 is of little relevance. It is, of course, after RMBC informed the Appellant that it would not respond to any further FOI requests as they would be considered 20vexatious. That may have increased the Appellant’s animosity towards RMBC and its officers, but it can hardly be evidence that he was so motivated at the time of this request when made in February 2017. 103. The caselaw, as far as the Tribunal is aware, is silent as to when the test is to be applied, but the Tribunal’s view is that the test whether a request is or is not vexatious is to be applied at the time it was made, and not in the light of subsequent events. That is the natural meaning of the wording of the section, and is consistent with the duty under the FOIA upon an authority to respond within a specified period of time. Thus, whilst a factor, this Tribunal does not consider that any evidence of subsequent conduct is of any real relevance to the issue of vexatiousness at the time of the request. 104. Further, the similarity of the Appellant’s requests was because of the incomplete and unsatisfactory responses of RMBC – admitted on at least two occasions – to previous requests, and as may also be observed, for this has been a consistent finding, repeated failures to deal with previous requests within the specified time limits. 105. With respect, the Tribunal cannot agree with the submission made at para. 49 of the IC’s response to the appeal [0086/38] to the effect that the delay in obtaining the information relating to the previous FOI request dated 16 September 2015 is not a relevant consideration as to whether this request is vexatious. RMBC have rather made it so, because RMBC have referred to and relied upon the repeated and overlapping nature of the Appellant’s previous requests in support of the contention that this request is vexatious. If a holistic approach is to be taken, the adequacy of previous responses, as well as the number, frequency and content of previous requests must be equally relevant considerations. 106. In terms of the burden upon the authority, it has to be observed that this request is of a very specific nature, and is unlikely to burden RMBC unduly. It relates to information as to how David McWilliams shared information relating to Voices with the Departmental Leadership Team sometime between March and September 2015. This is unlikely to result in extensive paperwork, or copious email traffic, given what has been disclosed thus far, the Tribunal would have thought. As the involvement of the DLT was something which only emerged sometime after the original response to the first request, the Tribunal considers that there is indeed a public interest in this issue being explored further, and that it is proportionate to do so by seeking the limited information requested in this request. 21107. The remaining headings referred to in RMBC’s Briefing document referred to in para.84 above have not been relied upon by the IC, and the Tribunal does not consider them germane. To the extent that any personal grudge is alleged, the Tribunal does not agree, and discounts this. For the reasons given above, the after the event online Petition is similarly of no weight. 108. Thus, for all these reasons, this Tribunal finds that the high hurdle of establishing that this was a vexatious request has not been satisfied, the appeal is allowed. 109. The Tribunal will accordingly issue a substituted Decision Notice. That may, however, be of academic benefit, as the authority may well still respond to the request in terms as to whether such information is held, with the same results as previously. We consider, however, that the appellant is entitled to a finding that the request in question was not vexatious, and so rule. Signed: Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dated: 1 May 2019. 22"
"8","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0078 Decided without a hearing On 19 November 2018 Before JUDGE BUCKLEY MELANIE HOWARD MARION SAUNDERS Between ANTHONY MORLAND Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent THE CABINET OFFICE Second Respondent OPEN DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the Tribunal allows the appeal against Decision Notice FS50588594 and issues the following substitute decision notice. 12. All parties consented to the matter being determined on the papers and the Tribunal considered that it was appropriate to determine the appeal without an oral hearing. 3. There is also a closed annex in order not to undermine the Tribunal’s decision on what information should be disclosed in accordance with rule 14. The annex will remain closed until after the latest date for applying for permission to appeal or until the conclusion of any appeal. A redacted version of the annex will be released after that date. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: The Cabinet Office Complainant: Anthony Morland The Substitute Decision – FS50588594 1. For the reasons set out below s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) are engaged but the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in relation to the parts of the withheld information identified in the closed annex. 2. For the reasons set out below s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) are engaged and the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the exemption in relation to the remainder of the withheld information identified in the closed annex. Action Required 1. The Public Authority is required to respond to the complainant’s request within 42 days of the promulgation of this judgment by supplying the information identified in the closed annex. REASONS Introduction and procedural background 1. The request for information arises out of a campaign for the introduction of. National Defence Medal (‘NDM’) to recognise the service of Armed Forces members who did not serve in specific conflicts. The request dated 8 April 2015 asks for minutes of the Honours and Decorations Committee (‘HD Committee’) held on 23 February 2015. 22. This is Mr Morland’s appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice of 1 March 2016 FS50588594 which held that the Cabinet Office was entitled to rely on s 37(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and that the public interest favoured withholding the information. 3. Mr Morland’s appeal was heard by a differently constituted first tier tribunal which allowed the appeal. That first-tier tribunal will be referred to in the decision as the ‘2017 Tribunal’. It concluded on 16 January 2017 that: 3.1. The scope of the request was limited to item 3, paragraph 4 of the 23 February 2015 HD Committee minutes headed ‘National Defence Medal”. 3.2. Section 37 was not engaged because it applied only to the conferral of existing Honours and Decorations, not the creation of new Honours and Decorations. 3.3. Section 35 was not engaged because the 2017 Tribunal was not satisfied that policy was still being formulated or developed. 4. The Cabinet Office’s appeal of that decision was allowed by the Upper Tribunal on 1 March 2018. The Upper Tribunal concluded that: 4.1. The 2017 Tribunal had been entitled to find as a matter of fact that the process of policy formulation and development was over by the time Mr Morland made his request. It did not follow that the s 35(1) exemption was not engaged and the 2017 Tribunal should have found that it was. 4.2. The 2017 Tribunal should also have found that the exemption in s 37(1)(b) was engaged. 5. The matter was remitted to this Tribunal. In accordance with the Upper Tribunal decision we must proceed on the basis that s 35 and 37 are engaged and decide where the balance of public interest lies. 6. Four appeals arising out of a similar factual background have been heard by the Tribunal on the same day. They are: EA/2016/0078 (Morland v IC and Cabinet Office); EA/2017/0295 (Cabinet Office v IC and Scriven); EA/2016/0281 (Cabinet Office v IC and Farrar); and EA/2018/0098 (Cabinet Office v IC and Halligan). Much of the factual background appears in each decision. Factual background 7. The National Defence Medal (‘NDM’) proposed by campaigners is a medal in recognition of service which, subject to certain criteria, would be awarded to 3all Regular and Reserve servicemen and women who have served in the Armed Forces since the end of the Second World War. It is intended to honour veterans who did not participate in a specific conflict, but who stood ready to do so as members of the Armed Forces. Mr Morland is the co-chair of the NDM campaign. 8. A medal review was carried out by the Ministry of Defence in 2011. This review is described as ‘flawed and discredited’ by the UK NDM campaign for the reasons set out at pp5-8 of their NDM submission dated 3 May 2012. On 30 April 2012 the Prime Minister announced a further independent review. 9. In May and June 2012 Sir John Holmes conducted an independent review of the policy concerning military medals including the case for a National Defence Medal. The review team received over 200 submissions and spoke to more than 50 individuals including representatives from veteran groups. 10. The report was published in July 2012 (‘the Holmes Report’). In relation to NDM Sir John Holmes recommended that it was ‘worthy of consideration’ and that: Its merits, and examples from other countries, should be looked at by a Cabinet Office- led working group in the first place, before consideration by the reconstituted HD Committee and its sub-committee. Any recommendations should be made initially to the government, rather than The Queen, and would then need to be the subject of wider political and other consultation, since this is a decision of broad national significance which would require a broad political and public consensus. (P123 of the Holmes Report) 11. Paragraph 17, p 10 of the Holmes Report reads as follows: … the current system of decision-making is vulnerable to the charge of being a “black box” operation, where those outside have no knowledge of what is being decided or why and have no access to it; and where the rules and principles underlying the decisions, while frequently referred to, have never been properly codified or promulgated. 12. With specific reference to the HD Committee, the Holmes Report stated, on p27: The process is also largely invisible and inaccessible to those outside the system, which has substantially added to the frustration of veterans and other campaigners, unable to penetrate beyond bland official statements that a particular decision has been taken. 13. Under the United Kingdom Constitution, honours and decorations are created and conferred by Her Majesty the Queen in her personal capacity as Monarch rather than on behalf of the Government. The ‘HD Committee’ (the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals) is a sub-committee of the 4Cabinet. It is a permanent standing committee established in 1939 at the request of George VI to provide advice to The Sovereign on policy concerning honours, decorations and medals. It operates under the direction of the Head of the Civil Service, who nominally chairs the Committee, and its current terms of reference are: To consider general questions relative to the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals; to review the scales of award, both civil and military, from time to time, to consider questions of new awards, and changes in the conditions governing existing awards. 14. The HD Committee directly advises The Queen on policy relating to the grant of individual honours, decorations and medals. It also considers general questions relating to this topic, including the introduction of new awards. The Committee’s more general recommendations are also put forward for The Sovereign’s formal approval. 15. The HD Committee meets typically two or three times a year. The role of chair of the HD Committee is currently formally delegated to Sir Jonathan Stephens, Permanent Secretary to the Northern Ireland Office. The members of the HD Committee are: Private Secretary to HM The Queen Principal Private Secretary to the PM Permanent Secretary, FCO Permanent Secretary, Home Office Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence Defence Services Secretary Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of the Knighthood. 16. Following the Holmes report, the Prime Minister asked Sir John Holmes to lead a second stage of work to make further recommendations using the principles he had proposed to implement his findings. Reviews of certain claims for medallic recognition were undertaken by an independent review team, and Sir John Holmes’s recommendations in relation to these were put before the Advisory Military Sub-Committee (the ‘AMSC’ – a sub-committee of the HD Committee set up in response to the Holmes report) at the first meeting of the AMSC, on 12 December 2012 and 29 August 2013. An NDM paper, prepared by Cabinet Office officials was put before the AMSC on 29 August 2013. At that meeting on 29 August Sir John Holmes outlined 21 further claims for medallic recognition which had not yet been looked at by the independent review team, and gave recommendations as to the way forward, i.e. whether or not these should be reviewed. 17. All these claims, including the NDM, came before the HD Committee on 29 January 2014 and/or on 9 June 2014. 518. On 29 July 2014 a written ministerial statement from Baroness Stowell informed the House of Lords that the review was complete, stating that: Sir John was therefore commissioned to review independently a number of cases which had been brought to his attention as possible candidates for changed medallic recognition. The aim was to draw a definitive line under issues which in some cases had been controversial for many years… Each of the reviews has been subject to detailed discussion by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals and its conclusions submitted for Royal Approval….The outcomes where detailed reviews were carried out are listed in the Annexe to this statement. 19. In relation to the NDM Baroness Stowell stated that the HD Committee was ‘not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time but has advised that this issue might usefully be considered in the future’. This was in contrast to other historic claims for medallic recognition where it was stated that there would be no possibility of reconsideration in the absence of significant new evidence of injustice. 20. The NDM options paper that was considered by the HD Committee at the point that it made its recommendations was placed in the Library of the Lords. We accept the Cabinet Office’s assertion that although it is dated after the HD Committee meeting, that is merely the date of publication and that it is the same options paper that was before the Committee. 21. Correspondence subsequently took place between the Cabinet Office and the NDM campaign and the HD Committee considered that correspondence at a meeting on 23 February 2015, concluding that the time was not right for a review. These minutes are the subject of the request in this appeal. 22. Following that meeting the co-chair of the NDM campaign, Colonel Scriven, was informed of the conclusion by letter dated 4 March 2015: …I brought our recent correspondence on the National Defence Medal to the attention of HD Committee at its last meeting. The Committee had a further discussion, carefully noting the points that you have made. It was particularly concerned that some veterans have gained the impression that it made its decision on the basis of a diluted submission. It has therefore asked me to reassure you that its discussion have taken proper account of the arguments put forward by many veterans and in your own letters. However, the Committee remained unpersuaded of the case at this time’. 23. In an email to Mr Morland dated 8 April 2015, Gary Rogers of the Cabinet Office stated, in relation to the meeting of 23 February 2015: HD Committee had before it recent correspondence from Colonel Scriven, Co- Chairman of the UK National Defence Medal Campaign, but whilst the Committee noted the points made by Colonel Scriven, members remained unpersuaded of the case for an NDM at this time. In light of this, there are no plans for further work on this issue… You will be aware that Stephen Gilbert’s Private Member’s Bill on the 6National Defence Medal which was due to have a second reading on 27 February, we not reached. 24. There was a House of Commons Debate on NDM on 12 April 2016. The HD Committee considered reopening the NDM issue again on 1 February 2017 and remained unconvinced. 25. By letter dated 14 February 2017 Colonel Scriven made an official complaint under the Cabinet Office complaints procedure to the minister for the Cabinet Office, Ben Gummer MP. The complaint alleged failures by the head of the Honours and Appointments Secretariat to appropriately oversee the Cabinet Office responsibilities of the Holmes review and the alleged provision of misinformation about the veracity of the medal review process. Mr Gummer tasked Sir Jonathan Stephens, the chair of the HD Committee, with carrying out an investigation into the complaint. 26. Sir Jonathan Stephens asked a retired former senior civil servant to consider the complaint. His conclusions were that the review was handled entirely properly, but that the figure used in the Westminster debate on 12 April 2016 for the cost of introducing NDM (£475m) was wrongly attributed to the Holmes review, whereas it was an MOD estimate. The error was repeated in a Written Parliamentary Answer on 25 April 2016. Colonel Scriven was informed of the outcome and sent a copy of the report by letter dated 28 July 2017. In that letter Sir Jonathan Stephens apologised for the error of attribution and indicated that the parliamentary record would be set straight. He concluded ‘I am afraid I will not be able to correspond further with you on this issue. As you know, the Minister decided in July 2014 not to introduce a National Defence Medal. That remains the position and unless, or until, there is change of policy there will be nothing more to add.’ 27. Colonel Scriven wrote again to Sir Jonathan Stephens on 15 January 2018. He asserted that the investigation and its conclusions were flawed. His letter requests either that the military medal review is reopened or that the matter is referred to the parliamentary ombudsman for an in-depth evaluation of the whole process, with a view to reopening the review. Request, Decision Notice and appeal Request 28. This appeal concerns the following request made on 8 April 2015 in the context of an exchange of correspondence about the National Defence Medal. It is important to note that it forms part of a reply to an email from the Cabinet Office informing Mr Morland that the NDM had come before the HD Committee again on 23 February 2015 and that members remained unpersuaded of the case for an NDM at this time. The request from Mr Morland, in response to that email was: 7Perhaps you could also pass on (under the FOI Act) a request to see the minutes of the HD Committee meeting which reached this conclusion. At least we will then be able to address the perceived weaknesses in the case, and you can stop fielding the same questions. Reply and review 29. The Cabinet Office responded on 1 May 2015, refusing the request on the basis of s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b). It upheld its decision on internal review on 27 May 2015. Mr Morland referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 5 August 2015. Decision Notice 30. In a decision notice dated 1 March 2016 the Commissioner decided that the Cabinet Office was entitled to rely on s 37(1)(b) and that the public interest favoured withholding the information. The Commissioner did not go on to consider s 35. In balancing the public interest, the Commissioner accepted the need for a level of confidentiality to provide a safe space which allows free and frank discussion of proposals, and that disclosure of views and opinions made in confidence is likely to have a chilling effect in future. 31. In relation to the minutes that did not relate to the National Defence Medal the strong public interest in protecting a safe space outweighed the public interest in transparency. In relation to the minutes relating to the National Defence Medal, the Commissioner found that there was a strong public interest in transparency and in particular in understanding why the UK has an approach which differs from other Commonwealth nations. Further weight was added to the public interest in protecting a safe space by the fact that the matter was not completed. The Commissioner found that the public interest was finely balanced but that, by a narrow margin, the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption in relation to this section of the minutes. Notice of Appeal 32. Mr Morland appealed against the Commissioner’s decision notice. In summary, the relevant parts of the notice of appeal challenge the Commissioner’s decision notice on the grounds that the public interest favours disclosure. He also asserts that the decision-making process was criticised for its lack of transparency by Sir John Holmes in the Military Medals Review and that the Military Sub-Committee stage was not independent. The Commissioner’s response 833. The ICO’s response dated 29 April 2016 submits that the Commissioner took proper account of the public interest in disclosure. The alleged lack of independence from government was not evidenced, nor was it relevant to the public interest balance. The Appellant’s reply to the Commissioner 34. In his replies dated 10 and 11 May 2016 Mr Morland makes the following points: 34.1. Confidentiality should have less weight in the case of the NDM because of the large number of people affected. 34.2. A redacted copy, including removing names, would preserve confidentiality. 34.3. The decision-making process has been criticised in the Holmes Report for being a ‘black box’ where outsiders have no knowledge of what is being decided and why. 34.4. It is in the public interest to know if matters were properly considered, how long the attendees took to reach a conclusion, how many members attended, what influence was exercised, whether it was unanimous or a close-run thing. 34.5. The government has made it clear that they have no intention of revisiting the case. 34.6. It is important to know what figures on the cost of the medal influenced the decision, in the light of debate around the accuracy of the figures relied upon. If the debate is not closed, it is important to know this to inform a decision on what new evidence should be brought forward on cost. 34.7. The references to Sir John Holmes’ ‘recommendations’ on the NDM in a debate on 12 April 2016 raise questions as to what was before the HD Committee. Providing the minutes would clarify this. The Cabinet Office’s reply 35. In its reply dated 28 June 2016 the Cabinet Office makes the following points: 35.1. The confidentiality of the honours system is important in ensuring its effective and efficient operation. 35.2. It would be a considerable departure from the general approach of the Commissioner to order disclosure. 35.3. The high level of public interest and emotion in the NDM proposal is a key reason why there is a particular need to preserve a safe space. 35.4. S 35 should be considered in the alternative. 35.5. The perception of a lack of independence is irrelevant. 35.6. The Appellant has significantly overstated the extent to which consideration of the NDM proposal has been kept private. It is not a secretive and undemocratic process. A lot of information is in the public domain. The conclusions on the NDM of the Ministry of Defence 9Advisory Military Sub-Committee of the HD Committee have been made public. The HD Committee conclusions were made public. Only the detail of the HD Committee deliberations has been withheld. The Appellant’s reply to the Cabinet Office 36. In his reply dated 9 July 2016 Mr Morland makes a number of points including: 36.1. The need for a safe space is acknowledged but outweighed because no judgment can be made on the fairness of the decision without detailed rationale. 36.2. This is a matter of great national importance. 36.3. The decision was made by only four unelected representatives out of the 14 strong committee. 36.4. It was not independent: all four had a duty towards supporting the government position 36.5. It was not an in-depth review. Less than 5-6 minutes were spent discussing each submission including the NDM. 36.6. Because the Queen has already approved a similar award for Australia and New Zealand, the rationale needs to be transparent. 36.7. The considerable interest in and emotion surrounding NDM is a factor that supports disclosure rather than the withholding of the information. 36.8. Once a decision is taken the need for a safe space diminishes. 36.9. Scrutiny strengthens or allows challenge of decisions. Legal framework 37. The relevant parts of s 1 and 2 of the FOIA provide: General right of access to information held by public authorities. 1(1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. Effect of the exemptions in Part II. ....... 2(2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 38. Section 35(1)(a) of FOIA provides as follows: 35 Formulation of government policy, etc. 10(1) Information held by a government department or by the Welsh Assembly government is exempt information if it relates to— (a) the formulation or development of government policy 39. The question of whether the policy-making process is still ‘live’ is an issue that goes to the assessment of the public interest balancing test (Morland v Cabinet Office [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC). 40. The inter-section between the timing of the FOIA request and its relevance to the public interest balancing test is helpfully analysed by the First-tier Tribunal in Department for Education and Skills v Information Commissioner and the Evening Standard (EA/2006/0006) (“DFES”) at paragraph 75(iv)-(v) (a decision approved in Office of Government Commerce v Information Commissioner [2008] EWHC 774 (Admin); [2010] QB 98 (“OGC”) at paragraphs 79 and 100-101): (iv) The timing of a request is of paramount importance to the decision. We fully accept the DFES argument, supported by a wealth of evidence, that disclosure of discussions of policy options, whilst policy is in the process of formulation, is highly unlikely to be in the public interest, unless, for example, it would expose wrongdoing within government. Ministers and officials are entitled to time and space, in some instances to considerable time and space, to hammer out policy by exploring safe and radical options alike, without the threat of lurid headlines depicting that which has been merely broached as agreed policy. We note that many of the most emphatic pronouncements on the need for confidentiality to which we were referred, are predicated on the risk of premature publicity. In this case it was a highly relevant factor in June 2003 but of little, if any, weight in January 2005. (v) When the formulation or development of a particular policy is complete for the purposes of (iv) is a question of fact. However, s. 35(2) and to a lesser extent 35(4), clearly assume that a policy is formulated, announced and, in many cases, superseded in due course. We think that a parliamentary statement announcing the policy, of which there are examples in this case, will normally mark the end of the process of formulation. There may be some interval before development. We do not imply by that that any public interest in maintaining the exemption disappears the moment that a minister rises to his or her feet in the House. We repeat – each case must be decided in the light of all the circumstances. As is plain however, we do not regard a “seamless web” approach to policy as a helpful guide to the question whether discussions on formulation are over. 41. The public interest can wax and wane and the need for a safe space changes over time in relation to development of policy. If disclosure is likely to intrude upon the safe space then there will, in general terms, be significant public interest in maintaining the exemption, but this has to be assessed on a case by case basis. 42. S 37 FOIA provides where relevant as follows: 1137 Communications with Her Majesty, etc. and honours. (1) Information is exempt information if it relates to – … (b) the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity. 43. Sections 35 and 37 are not absolute exemptions. The Tribunal must consider if, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 44. In considering the factors that militate against disclosure the primary focus should be on the particular interest which the exemption is designed to protect, in the case of s 35 this is the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy (see e.g. para 57 in the FTT decision in HM Treasury v ICO EA/2007/0001). 45. The Upper Tribunal in Morland v Cabinet Office [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC) held that: …the purpose of section 37 itself is to protect the fundamental constitutional principle that communications between the Queen and her ministers are essentially confidential. Section 37(1)(a)-(ad)…specifically protects the actual communications with the Sovereign and certain other members of the Royal Family and the Royal Household. Section 37(1)(b) must be concerned with activities other than communications with the Sovereign. The logical purpose of section 37(1)(b) is to ensure candour and protect confidences in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and medals. 46. The balance of public interest should be assessed as it stood at the time of the outcome of the internal review (Savic v ICO AGO and CO [2016] UKUT 0534 (AAC) at para 10). 47. The APPGER case gives guidance on how the balancing exercise required by section 2(2)(b) of FOIA should be carried out: … when assessing competing public interests under FOIA the correct approach is to identify the actual harm or prejudice that the proposed disclosure would (or would be likely to or may) cause and the actual benefits its disclosure would (or would be likely to or may) confer or promote. This … requires an appropriately detailed identification of, proof, explanation and examination of both (a) the harm or prejudice, and (b) benefits that the proposed disclosure of the relevant material in respect of which the exemption is claimed would (or would be likely to or may) cause or promote. 48. The public interest is not the same as being of interest to the public. 49. When a qualified exemption is engaged, there is no presumption in favour of disclosure. The proper analysis is that, if, after assessing the competing public 12interests for and against disclosure having regard to the content of the specific information in issue, the Tribunal concludes that the competing interests are evenly balanced, we will not have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption (against disclosure) outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (as section 2(2)(b) requires) (Department of Health v Information Commission and another [2017] EWCA Civ 374). The role of the Tribunal 50. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Evidence 51. The Tribunal read and took account of a closed and an open witness statement dated 11 May 2018 of Helen Ewen, Head of the Honours Secretariat, on behalf of the Cabinet Office. The contents of this statement will not be summarised here, but it has been taken into account, where relevant, in making findings on the factual background and in our conclusions below. Mr Morland’s assertions as to the accuracy of this statement and the Cabinet Office’s response have been noted and taken account of where relevant. 52. We note for example that the Cabinet Office accepts an error in paragraph 12 which states ‘The conclusions of Sir John Holmes report (HE10/1-70) (to which I refer below) were put before The Sovereign for approval’. This is intended to state that the Options Paper was put before the Sovereign for approval. 53. The Tribunal was referred to and took account of a large number of documents. Submissions 54. The Tribunal read closed and open submissions from the Information Commissioner and the Cabinet Office and open submissions from Mr Morland. All the submissions were read and taken account of where relevant. There are a large number of submissions in this case and we do not repeat all the points here. 55. The closed submissions were short and dealt with certain specific details in the withheld information which both the Commissioner and the Cabinet Office agreed increased the public interest in maintaining the s 37 exemption. We cannot provide further information on the gist of those submissions without undermining the effect of this decision. 13Submissions from Mr Morland dated 12 April 2018 56. FOIA revelations have disclosed substantial discrepancies in the way the NDM submission and the medal review process was handled. The indication of alleged wrongdoing having been committed impacts on the credibility of the HD Committee. This invalidates the safe space argument. 57. The myriad of FOIA requests submitted demonstrate the significant dissatisfaction with the military review process and disclosure of apparent wrongdoing within government. 58. Policy formulation was no longer in process. 59. The close relationship between the disputed information and the whole medal review of the NDM means that the Tribunal should take account of the public interest relating to the whole military medal review process. There is significant public interest in: 59.1. knowing who decided, and why, that the AMSC would be located within the MoD and that it would not include independent members; 59.2. knowing why the finalised minutes of the AMSC meeting on 5 December 2012 were lost or not produced, whether action was taken to deal with this and if it was brought to the attention of the HD Committee; 59.3. knowing why, in the HD Committee meeting on 29 August 2013, some medal submissions were not reviewed fully or at all, why the secretariat did not rectify this and if the HD Committee were aware of this; 59.4. knowing how many HD Committee members did not attend meetings dealing with the military medals review findings; 59.5. knowing if the HD Committee were aware that the Secretariat was sending misleading correspondence claiming that the HD Committee had carried out lengthy, full and careful discussions prior to making decisions. 60. Further Mr Morland asserts that: 60.1. the Secretariat failed to exercise due diligence; 60.2. the investigation of Colonel Scriven’s complaint was a cause of concern. 61. Given the loss of the AMSC minutes; the failure of the AMSC to review every medal submission properly or at all and a lack of substance in the comments on other medal submissions shown in the minutes of 29 August 2013, the HD Committee could only have made unsound decisions and recommendations. 14It is in the public interest to know why the HD Committee took no action in the February 2015 meeting. 62. The HD Committee’s attention was drawn to the misinformation and overestimates in relation to cost of the NDM and it is in the public interest to know what was discussed in the February meeting in relation to cost. Release of the February minutes would show if the erroneous attribution of £475m had influenced the HD Committee’s position, contrary to the conclusion in the report on the investigation of Colonel Scriven’s complaint. 63. Mr Morland alleges wrongdoing by the government as follows: 63.1. MoD becoming gatekeeper of the advice submitted to the HD Committee 63.2. The loss of minutes 63.3. Failure to appropriately or at all review all the medal submissions 63.4. Failure of all members of HD Committee to attend vital decision meetings 63.5. Failure to account for expenditure of tax payers' money on legal representation to keep details of the medal review out of the public domain 63.6. Misinformation given about the veracity of the medal review 63.7. Lack of due diligence by the HD Committee secretariat 63.8. A flawed investigation into Colonel Scriven’s complaint resulting in a fudged report endorsed by the Chair of the HD Committee on behalf of the Cabinet Office. 64. The HD Committee meeting which took place on 9 June 2014 should have allowed plenty of time for the ministerial statement to be factored into Parliament’s order of business prior to its summer recess. It was presented the day after Parliament had risen on 29 July 2014. The delay avoided debate by MPs about the decision not to institute the NDM. 65. The options paper is dated 28 July 2014. This casts doubt on whether or not HD Committee members saw it or were aware of its contents prior to promulgation. 66. The Tribunal is asked to consider directing that the right to claim a ‘safe space’ is invalidated in cases where it can be shown that unsound decisions have been reached based on inaccurate and/or erroneous advice. Open submissions from The Cabinet Office dated 11 May 2018 Aggregation 67. Where more than one exemption is relevant in a case, then the exemptions should be aggregated, so that the Tribunal considers whether overall the public interest in maintaining the exemptions outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Office of Communications v IC [2009] EWCA Civ 90 at para. 35- 1543, confirmed by the CJEU in Case C71-10 [2011] 2 Info LR 1, [2012] CMLR 7; Home Office and Ministry of Justice v the Information Commissioner [2009] EWHC 1611 (Admin) para.25; Department of Health v IC (EA/2013/0087) at para. 49-58. 68. This is so even if the exemptions are unrelated, because of the impact of s 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 see Office of Communications v IC para.37. The exemptions are in any event related because there is a clear overlap. Aggregation is an intellectual not a mathematical exercise. Public Interest in disclosure 69. The public interest in disclosure is minimal. A substantial amount of information was in the public domain. Disclosure of one section of the minutes of one meeting does little to serve the public interest to see that the HD Committee functions effectively and properly. The content of the withheld information would add nothing to the public understanding of the issues related to NDM. It will not identify the perceived weaknesses in the NDM case. None of the arguments advanced by Mr Morland in para. 41 of his additional submissions of 12 April 2018 are relevant to the particular information in scope of this request. 70. The requested information will add very little to public understanding of the functioning of the committee or of the debate on NDM. Public interest in maintaining the exemption 71. Under s.35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) taken alone, the public interest favours withholding the information. Aggregated together, they clearly outweigh the public interest in disclosure. S 35(1)(a) 72. The information falls within the exemption for two reasons: it relates to ongoing handling of the policy on NDM (macro) and it relates to policy in relation to responding to recent correspondence from the NDM campaign (micro). 73. The fact that policy development has ceased does not mean that the public interest in maintaining the exemption disappears although it may be reduced. 74. The Cabinet Office accepts the factual finding of the 2017 Tribunal that policy in relation to NDM was not still being formulated or developed but that is only part of the picture. The meeting on 23 February 2015 was about whether there was any case for reviewing the previously announced policy position which continues to arise. The question of whether a policy should be reviewed is a 16question of policy. There was still a live issue on macro policy issue at the relevant date and so considerations of ‘safe space’ remain relevant to NDM policy and considerations of NDM policy by the HD Committee. With a long- running campaign it is important to have a safe space for the frank exchange of views before an agreed position is communicated publicly. 75. The fact that the agreed position is communicated publicly does not remove the need for a safe space because the public interest in maintaining the safe space in which that decision was taken and in which future decisions will be taken remains (see HE para 34-55). Those involved thought they were operating in a safe space because of constitutional conventions and the way in which the minutes were expressed. There would be a chilling effect on the way in which views were expressed and in the way in which minutes were taken to the detriment of the administrative and historic records. S.37(1)(b) 76. It is a fundamental constitutional principle that communications with the Sovereign are confidential, reflected in the absolute exemption in s 37(1)(a). In considering the weight to be given to s 37(1)(b) its close relationship with s 37(1)(a) must be appreciated. The purpose of s 37(1)(b) is to protect confidences and ensure candour in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and medals, a process which involves making recommendations to the Queen. There is potential for the constitutional principle to be undermined if the deliberations of the Queen’s advisors in the form of the HD Committee are made public. There is a strong expectation, in accordance with the constitutional principle that these deliberations should also be confidential. 77. The maintenance of confidentiality in the entire process is important because it ensures that participants are free to express their views with complete frankness and candour. There is significant interest in the quality of debate and and in these views being reflected in the historical record (s 37(1)(b) being time- limited to information under 60 years old). This would be affected if information falling within the s 37(1)(b) were routinely disclosed. 78. Therefore, the public interest in maintaining the exemption will only be outweighed where there is a clear public interest in disclosure. 79. The safe space and chilling effect submissions made under s.35 apply equally to s 37(1)(b). 80. Under s.37(1)(b) taken alone, the public interest favours withholding the information. Open submissions from the Commissioner dated 25 May 2018 1781. S 35 (1)(a) adds very modest weight to the public interest in maintaining the exemptions in this case because policy formulation had effectively ceased. There is therefore little public interest in maintaining a safe space for policy formulation. The remaining public interest considerations are similar to those in maintaining the s 37 exemptions and must not be double counted. 82. The interest that lies at the core of s 37 is the protection of the fundamental constitutional principle of the confidentiality of communications between the Queen and her ministers. S37(1)(b) protects a distinct aspect of this principle: the process of considering honours, dignities and medals because communication with the Sovereign is at the core of this process. However, the purpose of s.37(1)(b) is not to protect the entire honours process per se, but to ensure candour and confidences during the process. The public interest in maintaining the exemption will be weightiest where the requested information consists of or reveals the content of confidential information or candid discussions. 83. The Commissioner accepts that the requested information in this case engages this fundamental purpose because it is a record of a confidential discussion and there is a risk that the candour of future discussions would be compromised by disclosure. The Commissioner accepts the points made at paras. 44-45 of its submissions and in para 39 of Ms Ewen’s witness statement. 84. The Commissioner does not accept that there is a general rule to the effect that it should only be in cases that there is a clear public interest in disclosure that the public interest in maintaining the exemption will be outweighed. Where information does not reveal something confidential or candid discussions the public interest in maintaining it may be weak and only modest interests in its disclosure would be required for the balance to fall in favour of release. 85. In the absence of any current review or plan to review it, the policy on NDM cannot be regarded as under development in any meaningful sense. If there were a live question of whether to review a policy, it would give rise to a weaker public interest in protecting information than that relating to the original policy formulation. 86. In the meeting of which minutes are requested, the committee confirmed its earlier decision not to institute an NDM. This was communicated by letter dated 8 April 2015: ‘there are no plans for further work on this issue’. The position at the time of the request was that a decision had been taken and there were no plans to review it. Although non-government actors continue to press for consideration to be re-opened there is no indication that the Government regards it as a live question. There are therefore no compelling public interests in maintaining the s 35(1)(a) exemption that relate to preservation of a safe space for policy formulation. The interests in maintaining the exemption in 18relation to confidentiality and candour have already been weighed in the balance in consideration of the s 37(1)(b) exemption. Submissions from Mr Morland dated 2 June 2018 87. Mr Morland submits that Ms Ewen’s witness statement misrepresents the military medal review process in a number of significant ways, set out in detail in the submission. The Cabinet Office responded to this by email dated 15 June 2018. We have considered all the points made by both parties and the supporting evidence and taken account of them in our decision and in the summary of factual background where relevant. 88. The content of the exchange of correspondence between November 2014- January 2015 which was to be discussed in the HD Committee meeting of 23 February 2015 should have ‘set alarm bells ringing’ about the soundness of decisions/recommendations and should have led to a wish to address deficiencies. Disclosure of the minutes is of public interest, particularly if such discussion did not take place, or if few members attended the meeting. 89. Policy development in relation to NDM is not live: no further arguments have been put forward in support of the NDM since the original submission. The correspondence has related to re-opening the review. 90. Ms Ewen’s statement refers to a further previous meeting at which the policy position to be adopted in relation to correspondence was discussed. This adds to the public interest in disclosure. 91. The redaction of specific names with comments attributed would ensure confidentiality and candour and would counter the chilling effect of full disclosure. 92. The integrity and robust nature of the honours system has already been dented by the way in which the medal review has been carried out. 93. In summary, the public interest favours disclosure because: 93.1. The NDM could embrace realistically 2-4 million recipients and up to 7 million recipients. 93.2. There has been a concerted effort to conceal unfairness in this flawed medal review. 93.3. Redactions of attributability could counter the chilling effect of full disclosure and protect confidentiality and candour. Open submissions from the Cabinet Office dated 14 August 2018 94. The Cabinet Office notes that the Commissioner agrees that the requested information does, on the facts, engage the fundamental purpose of s 37(1)(b) in 19that it is a record of confidential discussions and there is a risk that future candour would be compromised. The Cabinet Office was not addressing cases where anodyne information fell within the scope of s 37(1)(b) and has no difficulty with the limitation that the Commissioner seeks to put on the Cabinet Office’s submissions in this respect. 95. The Commissioner is in effect contending that once the process of policy and formulation and development is complete there is never any public interest in maintaining the exemption. This is wrong. There may continue to be public interest in maintaining confidentiality in order to preserve the safe space for future policy formulation or for other reasons such as to avoid unnecessary distraction or diversion of public funds. 96. The information requested relates to a point at which policy formulation and development was still ‘live’ and there has been a public commitment to Parliament that the NDM might be considered again in the future. The fact that there were no specific plans to reconsider has to be seen in the context of (i) that public indication (ii) the ongoing campaign that needed careful handling and response (iii) that fact that the issue has been looked at subsequently which casts light on how the position should be viewed at the time. S35 does therefore make a material contribution. 97. Release of the closed material will not add materially to the public understanding and debate around NDM. 98. Redacting individual names would not affect the public interest in maintaining the exemption in this case. Submissions from Mr Morland dated 31 August 2018 99. Mr Morland criticises the way in which the bundle has been compiled, submitting that the order of the documents portrays his case unfairly. He asserts that Ms Ewen’s open statement is misleading and inaccurate, and so, it is reasonable to assume, is her closed statement. 100. It is astonishing that the HD Committee had been informed of the shortfalls of the medal review process and how the NDM submission has been dealt with but had decided to take no remedial action. 101. Ms Ewen’s comments in para 29 that disclosure of the HD Committee meeting minutes will not identify perceived weaknesses in the NDM case or add materially to the public understanding and debate around the case for NDM and her comments on the public interest in maintaining the exemptions at para 33, 35, 36 and 40 give a different representation of the content of the discussions to the information on the discussions given by Mr Tilbrook in his letter dated 4 March 2015. This difference adds weight to the public interest in disclosure. 20102. Paragraph 36 of Ms Ewen’s statement leads to reasonable questions about whether the decision by the HD Committee was influenced by political interventions by those present at the meeting. This heightens the public interest in disclosure. 103. The Cabinet Office highlights a reduction of almost two thirds of estimated veterans from seven million to 2.5 million. This questions the validity of the Ministerial Statement on 29 July 2014 and increases the public interest in understanding what correspondence was placed before the HD Committee on 23 February 2015, which can only be achieved by disclosure of the requested minutes. 104. There is no evidence to support the claim that policy discussions were still live. The assertion that the NDM campaign requires ‘careful handling and response’ is not a valid reason for claiming that policy formulation is still live. 105. Release of the minutes would alleviate public feelings of ‘a cover up’. If disclosure would increase those feelings, that is not a reason for withholding the information. 106. The ‘safe-space’ is not relevant to the issues raised by the NDM campaign which have related to the inadequacies of the process and the way the NDM submission was dealt with. 107. The letter from Mr Tilbrook dated 4 March 2015 suggests that the content of discussions in the relevant meeting was such that redaction of the minutes to remove names would be appropriate. 108. There is clear evidence that information and advice presented to the HD Committee was incorrect and lacked veracity. The decisions of the HD Committee on NDM have been shown to be unsound. The Cabinet Office are continuing to refuse to confirm how many members of the Committee attended the meeting on 23 February 2015. In these circumstances it is untenable to rely solely on the maintenance of the safe space under s 37 on the balance of public interest. 109. Mr Morland agrees in principle that there is a need to protect candour and confidences but submits that the free and frank discussions and advice proffered should have substance if good government is to be achieved and the protection of a safe space appropriately applied. 110. The military medal review was to be open and transparent, this should include the HD Committee deliberations. Her Majesty would expect the advice from the HD Committee to be sound, based on fact and therefore free from criticism. 21There is a public expectation that members of the HD Committee would be present and play an active part in discussions on the military medal review. 111. The protection of the ‘safe space’ should not be used where information before the HD Committee lacked veracity, most members of the Committee were absent, there are conflicting versions of what happened at the meeting of 23 February 2015 and decisions and recommendations were unsound. 112. In conclusion, the number of FOI claims and requests show that the review has not been open and transparent, nor has it addressed the inconsistency and injustice nor drawn a line in the sand. The situation is worse than before the 2011 review. 113. The minutes were requested so that Mr Morland could address the perceived weaknesses of the case for NDM in any future submission. Much has since been revealed about the deficiencies in the review. Most occurred prior to the request. They weigh heavily in the balance of public interest. The areas of neglect are highlighted in the submission of 12 April 2018. They are added to by the matters outlined in this submission. 114. A lack of accountability and questionable performance of the HD Committee have dented the integrity of the honours system. It is in the public interest to know why. Discussions and Conclusions 115. We agree with the 2017 tribunal that the scope of the request is limited to item 3 (paragraph 4) of the minutes. Aggregation 116. We note the parties' submissions in relation to aggregation. We do not need to decide whether or not exemptions need to be related in order to be aggregated: they are related in this case. We have looked at the aggregate effect of the exemptions in an impressionistic rather than mathematical way, considering where the different exemptions add weight and, conversely, where they overlap. While carrying out this exercise we have kept in mind the different interests protected by the different exemptions. The relevant date at which to assess the public interest 117. The public interest balance has to be assessed at the time of the request or at the latest at the date of the outcome of the internal review which took place in this case on 27 May 2015. The Tribunal cannot take account of matters that have happened since then, save where they shed light on the position at the relevant 22date. This includes some of the factors listed at paragraph 45 and detailed elsewhere in Mr Morland’s additional submission dated 31 August 2018. A contents-based approach 118. In our view it is not appropriate to assess the public interest in relation to a particular category of document (here, ‘minutes of the HD Committee’), irrespective of content. We find the following paragraphs in the Upper Tribunal’s judgment in Department of Health v Information Commissioner [2015] UKUT 159 to be of assistance in relation to a contents-based approach to public interest: 30. So a contents based assertion of the public interest against disclosure has to show that the actual information is an example of the type of information within the class description of an exemption (e.g. formulation of policy or Ministerial communications or the operation of a Ministerial private office), and why the manner in which disclosure of its contents will cause or give rise to a risk of actual harm to the public interest. It is by this route that: i) the public interest points relating to the class descriptions of the qualified exemptions, and so in maintaining the exemptions, are engaged (e.g. conventions relating to collective responsibility and Law Officers’ advice) and applied to the contents of the information covered by the exemption, and ii) the wide descriptions of (and so the wide reach of) some of the qualified exemptions do not result in information within that description or class that does not in fact engage the reasoning on why disclosure would cause or give rise to risk of actual harm (e.g. anodyne discussion) being treated in the same way as information that does engage that reasoning because of its content (e.g. examples of full and frank exchanges). 31. That contents approach will also highlight the timing issues that relate to the safe space argument. The timing issues are different to the candour or chilling effect arguments in that significant aspects of them relate to the likelihood of harm from distracting and counterproductive discussion based on disclosure before a decision is made. 32. Finally, I record that I agree that a contents approach does not mean that the information is not considered as a package (see Foreign and Commonwealth Office v Information Commissioner and Plowden [2013] UKUT 275 (AAC) at [16]). Indeed, such a consideration accords with the nature of a contents-based assessment because it reflects the meaning and effect of the content of the relevant information. 119. These parts of the judgment remain binding on us. Further the Court of Appeal [2017] EWCA Civ 374 approved a contents-based approach at para 46 (my emphasis): I agree with Charles J that, when a qualified exemption is engaged, there is no presumption in favour of disclosure; and that the proper analysis is that, if, after assessing the competing public interests for and against disclosure having regards to 23the content of the specific information in issue, the decision-maker concludes that the competing interests are evenly balanced, he or she will not have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption (against disclosure) outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (as section 2(2)(b) requires.) 120. We note the decision in Plowden referred to by the Upper Tribunal above, and we look at the information in context, i.e. on the basis that it appears in the minutes of discussions of the HD Committee. However, this does not mean that we must treat the document as a whole without regard to its contents. The FOIA regime is concerned with information not documents. When considering the public interest, we must look at the particular information contained in the document (see e.g. paras 33-36, DBERR v Information Commissioner and Friends of the Earth EA/2007/0072). Timing and the public interest 121. The question of the timing of the request is important because of the risks of the adverse effects of premature publicity on the particular interest which s 35 is intended to protect: the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy. 122. We do not consider that the question of the ‘liveness’ of a policy nor the question of the effect on the public interest should be seen as binary. Looking firstly at the effect on the public interest, it is clear that the public interest waxes and wanes with the circumstances: it is not a question of any public interest in maintaining a safe space disappearing the moment a policy is announced. The corollary of this, in our view, is that a policy’s liveness can also wax and wane. We do not accept that the policy development process should be seen a seamless web, because this suggests that the policy development process is always live. Nor do we accept that a policy development process is necessarily ‘dead’ the moment a policy is announced publicly. 123. All the circumstances must be taken into account in order to assess, at the relevant point in time, whereabouts on the spectrum the facts fall: a policy in the very early stages of development or at a critical point in its development process would fall near the live end of the spectrum and consequently the weight of the public interest in maintaining the exemption would be much greater. A policy which is announced with no intention of further work would fall near the other end of the spectrum. Somewhere in between lie policies which have been placed ‘on the backburner’, or that are due to be reviewed after a certain period of time. The policy development process does not move smoothly from one end of the spectrum to the other – as stated above, its ‘liveness’ waxes and wanes. The task for the Tribunal is to consider, taking into account the facts before it on the state of policy development at the relevant date, what impact the disclosure of this particular information at the relevant time might have on the particular interest of protecting the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation of government policy. 24124. On the facts we find that, at the relevant time, there was no ongoing process of policy formulation and development in terms of the substantive consideration of whether or not to introduce the NDM. The question of whether, at some point, that process would be rekindled was explicitly left open. On occasion, the decision on whether or not to re-open that substantive process was considered and taken. For example, the question of whether or not to re-open the process was considered and taken at the meeting of the HD Committee on 23 February 2015. We also accept that it was likely that the question of whether or not to re-open the substantive discussion on NDM would have to be considered again in the future. Further, a decision on how to respond to recent correspondence from the NDM campaign was taken at the meeting on 23 February 2015 and acted upon. There is nothing in the minutes of 23 February 2015 to support the suggestion that the discussions in that meeting related to any ongoing consideration of a policy on how to respond in general to correspondence from the NDM campaign. The Tribunal accepts that the question of how to respond to correspondence from the NDM campaign was something that was likely to have to be considered again in the future. We accept that the public interest in maintaining the exemption does not disappear the moment that a policy is announced. 125. Leaving aside the broader chilling effect arguments, which we consider below, we have asked ourselves whether, in the light of all the circumstances, the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy would be harmed or prejudiced by disclosure of this information in May 2015 because it was likely that these issues would have to be considered again. This is not a situation where disclosing the information requested would lead to the ‘threat of lurid headlines depicting that which has been merely broached as agreed policy’. The decision on how to respond had been made and acted upon at the time of the request. Further, the minutes, as redacted, contain no discussion of policy options, whether safe or radical. We cannot see how the disclosure of the requested information, as redacted, could have any adverse effect on the future policy formulation or development in this area. We cannot see how the release of this particular information at this particular time could undermine the Committee’s ability to respond appropriately and effectively to lobbying by groups with particular interests. The public interest under s 37 and s 35 126. The purpose of s 37(1)(b) is to ensure candour and protect confidences in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and medals. We accept that the HD Committee is a Committee that makes recommendations that are put before The Queen. We accept that underlying s 37 as a whole is the fundamental constitutional principle that communications with The Queen are confidential. 25127. We do not accept that this means that minutes of the HD Committee should never be disclosed. In our view, the content and context of the information will affect the public interest balance. Where the information contains or reveals confidential information or candid discussions, the public interest in maintaining the exemption will be stronger. Where that confidential information or those candid discussions result directly in recommendations to The Queen, the public interest in maintaining the exemption will be stronger. 128. We accept in relation to part of this information that revealing that information might compromise the candour of future discussions. Further reasons for this are provided in the closed annex. We find that this carries significant weight in the public interest balance. We accept that this effect on the candour of future discussions might also have an adverse effect on future policy formulation under s 35 in this area in terms of a more general chilling effect. There is a greater expectation of confidentiality in this sphere compared with other areas of policy development because of the role of The Sovereign and the underlying constitutional principle. We are therefore prepared to accept the risk of a chilling effect, even taking account of the robustness expected of civil servants. We find that the s 35 ‘chilling effect’ mainly overlaps with the matters set out above and therefore only adds limited additional weight. It does however add some weight: it is policy that is being discussed rather than a one-off decision on whether to award an individual a medal, and that has been statutorily recognised as a particular interest which is worthy of specific protection under s 35. 129. In relation to most of the information, we do not accept that revealing the information could compromise the candour of future discussions. It is a fairly anodyne description of the issue and an outline of the action that would be taken. It does not contain any substantive discussion of whether or not and NDM should be introduced, or whether any individual should be awarded a medal. It does not lead to a recommendation which would be put before The Sovereign. We conclude that the public interest in maintaining the exemptions, taken together, in relation to this part of the information is consequently very limited. 130. In terms of the public interest in disclosure there are many matters raised in this case that we do not think weigh in the balance, because they are not interests that would in fact be served by the disclosure of the particular information. We will not list all these irrelevant factors but, for example, disclosure of the information would not show who attended the meeting and therefore that is irrelevant to the public interest balance. 131. We find that the following matters add weight to the public interest in disclosure and that there is some public interest in disclosure. 26132. Firstly, it is not for us to judge whether or not the allegations made by the NDM campaign and Mr Morland about the review are well-founded. However, the medals review potentially impacted on a large number of people and we accept that allegations about the improper handling of medals review were put before the HD Committee. We find that there is some public interest in knowing what was said or not said about those allegations and that this public interest would be served, to a fairly limited extent, by the disclosure of this paragraph of the minutes. 133. Secondly, whilst we accept that much other information relating to the medals process has now been put in the public domain, we find that the general public interest in transparency in decision making in the medals process is heightened because the process was said, in the Holmes Report, to be ‘vulnerable to the charge of being a “black box” operation, where those outside have no knowledge of what is being decided or why’. It is clear that matters have moved on since the Holmes Report to some extent, but we find that there remains an enhanced general public interest in transparency in relation to the operation of the entire process. 134. In conclusion, for the reasons set out above we decide that in relation to part of the information the public interest in maintaining the exemptions is very limited. For the reasons set out above we decide that there is some public interest in disclosure of this information and in our view, it outweighs the very limited public interest in maintaining the exemption. In relation to part of the information, the public interest favours maintaining the exemption. Further reasons for this are contained in the closed annex. 135. Our decision is unanimous.

"9","Substantive Refusal","Amended on 18 March 2019 pursuant to the slip rule on Mr Peters' application First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/ 0142 Decided without a hearing Before JUDGE DAVID THOMAS TRIBUNAL MEMBERS MARION SAUNDERS AND ALISON LOWTON BETWEEN JOHN PETERS Appellant AND THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent AND THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONS NB Numbers in [square brackets] refer to the bundle The Tribunal’s decision The Tribunal substitutes a fresh decision notice to the effect that the University of Bristol (the University) was not entitled to rely on section 40(2) Freedom of Information Act 2000 and should therefore disclose the requested information to Mr Peters within the later of 35 days or the outcome of any appeal to the Upper Tribunal (see below as to the scope of the request). 1Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Mr Peters against the rejection by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 10 July 2018 of his complaint that the University had wrongly refused to disclose certain information to him under section 1(1)(b) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 2. The parties are content that the appeal be determined on the papers. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly do so within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009. 1 3. The University has sent material to the Tribunal on a closed basis. Factual background 4. Mr Peters suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The term CFS is often, but not always, used interchangeably with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). The Tribunal will refer compendiously to CFS/ME. Mr Peters and others are much exercised by some of the research carried out into the condition. In brief and probably crude summary, he and his fellow campaigners believe that the condition’s aetiology is physiological rather than psychological; they dispute research findings which indicate the contrary. For example, they regard research at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) known as PACE as methodologically flawed and its conclusions unwarranted. Mr Peters has made a number of FOIA requests in relation to that research, at least two of which have reached the Tribunal. 5. Mr Peters and others also question the validity of research into CFS/ME at the University; hence his FOIA request. The research is known by the acronym SMILE (Specialist Medical Intervention and Lightning Evaluation). It involves the Lightning Programme (LP), which is developed from osteopathy, life coaching and neuro-linguistic programming. The trial recruited 100 participants aged 12 to 18 with mild or moderate CFS/ME. Mr Peters says that recruitment started some eight years ago. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: one received medical care only and the other medical care plus LP. All the participants were asked to complete questionnaires at regular intervals about their levels of physical function, fatigue, pain, anxiety and school attendance. According to the University’s press release dated 20 September 2017 [91], those in the LP group had improved physical function at six months (improving further at 12 months); fatigue, anxiety and depression were reduced at six and 12 months; and school attendance also improved at 12 months. 1 SI 2009 No 1976 26. The press release also explains that CFS/ME affects at least one per cent of secondary school children in the UK. Around 250 children with the condition use LP each year. The principal investigator for the trial, Professor Esther Crawley, is professor of child health at the University and consultant paediatrician at the Royal United Hospital in Bath (RUH). The release says that the RUH is the largest paediatric CFS/ME clinical service in the UK, providing assessment and treatment for over 400 children from across the UK and Western Europe every year. A briefing produced by the University about the trial says that it recruited participants from a specialist paediatric CFS/ME service in the south west of England, and the University’s Response 2 confirms that the service was based at the RUH. Prof Crawley was the corresponding author in an open access article in Archives of Diseases in Children published in September 2017 [97] summarising the trial results (but not at the level of detail that Mr Peters has requested). 7. In his witness statement dated 9 December 2018, Mr Peters says that the study has been criticised, in particular for the ‘folding’ of a feasibility study into a full study and the switching of primary and secondary outcomes. It is not, of course, for the Tribunal to resolve the scientific disputes. Its role is limited to determining whether Mr Peters is entitled to the information he has requested. The request and the University’s response 8. On 26 September 2017, Mr Peters made this request of the University [55]: ‘These requests concern “Comparing specialist medical care with specialist medical care plus the Lightning Process for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME).: a randomised controlled trial (SMILE Trial)”. I have previously requested the trial data, your reference: FOQ17 193. In each instance following, the request is for anonymized data with personal identifiers removed. Please provide the following patient-level data at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year assessments, where available 1. SF-36 physical functioning scores. 2. School attendance in the previous week, collected as a percentage (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%). 3. Chalder Fatigue Scale Scores. 4. Pain visual analogue scale scores. 5. HADS scores 6. SCAS scores 7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health 8. Health Resource Use Questionnaire. I am happy to receive this information in electronic format’. 2 Para 12 3The scope of the request 9. In FOIA appeals, the Tribunal’s first task is to determine the scope of the request. Only then can an assessment be made whether the requester is entitled to some or all of the information. In his witness statement, Mr Peters indicated, as he had in his Reply to the University’s Response, that he would be content for the age and gender of participants to be removed from the data. This would, he said, have little impact on the value of the data. In fact, it does not appear that age and gender are within the scope of his carefully-calibrated request. Rather, Mr Peters wishes to know various outcome scores (including school attendance) and questionnaire responses. Construing a request is an objective task for the Tribunal but its conclusion here is fortified by Mr Peters’ confirmation that he does not want to know age and gender. The Tribunal will therefore determine whether he is entitled to the requested information on the basis that it does not extend to age and gender. 3 10. In relation to parts 7 and 8 (two questionnaires), it appears that what Mr Peters wants is the information in statistical form (as with parts 1 – 6). In its email of 22 June 2018 to the ICO [90], the University said in relation to these two parts: ‘In order to provide you with these two fields, the raw data would need to be processed, sanitised and prepared in order to extract what has been requested. This would take a large amount of time and effort due to the volume of raw data involved and the fact that it is not labelled in a way according directly with what is being asked for …’. The Commissioner quotes the passage in paragraph 14 of her Response. It is clear from Mr Peters’ Reply to that Response, and in particular his reliance on the ruling of the House of Lords in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner (Common Services Agency) 4 that barnardisation (a form of statistical presentation) does not create new information, that he was not expecting the raw data (i.e. the original answers in the questionnaires). The University did subsequently process the information into statistical form and sent it to the Commissioner (see paragraph 27 of its Response). The University’s Response 11. The University responded to the request on 3 November 2017 [59]. It confirmed that it held the requested information but refused to disclose it, relying on the exemption in section 40 FOIA (personal information) (in its form prior to the amendments made in 2018 to give effect to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 5). Although the University did not say so, it was clearly relying on subsection (2) (third party personal data): the information constituted the personal data of the research participants. It explained that, although the research data had been anonymised, it was derived from sensitive source material: information about the 3 See para 26 4 [2008] 1 WLR 1550 5 Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 4physical and mental health of children. Neither the research participants nor (where they were too young) their parents had consented to the release of ‘this detailed, individual-level patient data into the public domain’. However, the University was, it said, making the data available to the research community, with appropriate safeguards. This was in line with the Commissioner’s Code of Practice on Anonymisation: Managing Data Protection Risk (the Code) 6 which suggested that limited access was particularly appropriate for the handling of anonymised data derived from sensitive source material, ‘as it maintains control over further disclosure or use of the data and reduces the risk of exposing the data to attempts to re-identify the information’. 12. Mr Peters was not happy with this response. On 7 November 2017, he asked for a review [58], supporting his application with some of the arguments he has later run in the appeal. The University maintained its position on 5 December 2017 [57], arguing that it had to be certain that release of the requested information could not lead to the re-identification of the research participants. The Commissioner’s decision 13. Mr Peters made a complaint to the Commissioner on 16 December 2017 [63]. 14. The Commissioner gave her decision on 10 July 2018 [18]. She decided that the University was entitled to rely on section 40(2) FOIA. The information constituted ‘personal data’ within section 1 Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 1998). The Commissioner said she understood that each line of data referred to one individual trial participant. She applied the ‘motivated intruder’ test (see below) and her own guidance. 7 She distinguished the Tribunal’s decision in Matthees v Information Commissioner and Queen Mary University of London, 8 which concerned data from the PACE trial, on the basis that the database at issue there was a large national one of adults whereas the SMILE study covered 100 schoolchildren aged 12-18 in a very limited geographical area (which she described as Bristol). 15. The kernel of the Commissioner’s reasoning on the personal data issue is found in paragraph 27: ‘…having had the opportunity to review the detailed fatigue and anxiety score details and the school attendances in the withheld information, the Commissioner considers that it is more than remote and reasonably likely that individual children could be identified by combining this information which “relates to” individuals receiving specialist 6 https://ico.org.uk/media/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf 7 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1554/determining-what-is-personal data.pdf and https://ico.org.uk/media/for- organisations/documents/1549/determining_what_is_personal_data_quick_reference_guide.pdf 8 EA/2015/0259 5medical care for [CFS/ME] with information from other sources, such as school attendance records’. (The phrase ‘more than remote and reasonably likely’ is taken from the judgment of Mr Justice Cranston in R (Department of Health) v Information Commissioner (Department of Health). 9 16. The Commissioner then considered whether any of the data protection principles would be breached by disclosure and decided that the first (DPP1) would be. Disclosure would not be fair, particularly given that the patients had not given their consent. She also held that the information constitutes ‘sensitive personal data’ (for which there are additional barriers to disclosure) because it relates to physical or mental health of individuals. The pleadings 17. In his Grounds of Appeal [15], Mr Peters’ main argument was that there was no basis for the University’s fear that a motivated intruder could identify trial participants from a combination of the trial data and school attendance records. He argued that the intruder would need access to the records, for the three years the trial lasted, of every pupil in some 60 schools (his estimate of the number of schools in the trial catchment area, which he took to be Bristol and Bath). School attendance records were confidential and protected and the Commissioner, the ultimate guardian of the protection of data, should not have made a decision on the premise that protection of confidential data by public bodies (i.e. schools) was inadequate. Participants could only be identified with prior knowledge, one of the criteria of the motivated intruder test is that the intruder should not have such knowledge. 18. In her Response [20], the Commissioner said that she recognised that ‘the issue of whether the withheld information in this case is truly anonymised is not beyond argument and is finely balanced, particularly given the limited information provided by the public authority in this matter, the University of Bristol as to the means by which other information could be obtained that would enable individuals to be identified from the withheld information’. She had not expressed such reservations in her decision, which indicates that she is now less confident about the application of section 40(2). It is perfectly proper for the Commissioner to reconsider during the course of an appeal: it is not her function to defend her decision at any cost. 19. Because of the uncertainty she now felt, the Commissioner suggested that the University should be joined as a party. She is not, however, formally supporting Mr Peters’ appeal. She continues to maintain that all the requested information constitutes personal data and that disclosure would breach DPP1. She suggested 9 [2012] EWHC 1430 (Admin) 6that there might be a stronger argument that the information within parts 7 and 8 of the request (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health and Health Resource Use Questionnaire respectively), which she had not seen at that point, was personal data on the basis that it was ‘less anonymised’ than other data; alternatively, that information might not be held for the purposes of FOIA, given that public authorities have no obligation to create information to meet a request. She pointed out 10 that paragraph 27 of her decision contemplated the use of information from sources other than school attendance records, and suggested online blogs and forums (for example, with parents contributing) might reveal information from which a link could be made. She invited the University to make further representations on the risk of reidentification. 11 20. Mr Peters submitted a Reply to the Commissioner’s Response [39] on 25 September 2018. He questioned whether anyone would be motivated to try to identify the participants: there was no need to do so to criticise the trial, which was the objective of campaigners. There did not exist information in blogs and forums which could be used to identify participants, bearing in mind that the information about how a participant was feeling was now up to eight years old. 21. The University was indeed joined as a party. In its Response [45], it argued that the requested information was linked to the impact of a child’s illness on parental ability to work. It corrected Mr Peters’ misapprehension that the trial took place in Bristol: the recruitment centre was based, it said, in Bath and most of the children were recruited from Bath. The true figure of the number of schools from which pupils were recruited was believed to have been between three and nine at any one time, mainly from the Bath area. Mean school attendance for teenagers attending a specialist CFS/ME service is 40% (two days a week), an exceptionally low individual attendance rate such that the children would stand out clearly in any school attendance records. Access to attendance records was possible from various sources including teachers responsible for attendance, special needs teachers and Education Welfare Officers. Whilst attendance records were confidential, schools were regularly asked to review or submit records by a range of professional persons and authorised bodies. Personalised records were regularly obtained by parents and carers and a request made by, or on behalf of, a motivated intruder might be complied with unwittingly or inadvertently through human error. The University considered that there was a real risk that a motivated intruder might be able successfully to identify some, if not all, of the trial participants by obtaining school attendance records and comparing them to the SMILE data. Boys would be particularly easy to identify, since CFS/ME disproportionally affects girls after the age of 13. 10 Para 46 11 See paras 38 and 47 722. The University submitted that there was likely to be a ‘determined person with a particular reason to want to identify the individual’ within the public at large who would be motivated and able to identify the children to whom the SMILE data relates; even a small risk of reidentification of a single child participant would be unacceptable. 23. The University explained that it had categorised the requested information in its central research data repository as ‘Controlled data’: ‘Controlled data has a large degree of sensitivity involved. For example, research participants have not given explicit consent to share as open data and the risk of reidentification of participants is medium to high. Requests for Controlled data are referred to an appropriate Data Access Committee for approval before data can be shared with bona fide researchers, after their host institution has signed a Data Access Agreement’. The University argued that the provision of controlled data to researchers under carefully controlled conditions satisfied any legitimate public interest in the data whilst protecting the interests of participants. The University thereby complied with the Code, which suggested that making research data available to researchers (only) was ‘particularly appropriate for the handling of anonymised data from sensitive source material or where there was a significant risk of reidentification’. 24. Finally, the University sought to distinguish the Tribunal’s decision in Matthees: in addition to the fact that PACE was much larger and countrywide, data from SMILE had been made available to researchers from the moment the trial results were published, thereby facilitating legitimate scientific debate: that had not happened with PACE. 25. Mr Peters submitted a Reply to the University’s Response on 14 October 2018 [52]. He questioned why the various bodies listed by the University as having access to school records would wish to know trial data. They were allowed access to school records precisely because they were considered responsible and trustworthy. He said that he had read a number of documents all of which, as far as he was aware, referred to Bath and Bristol as being the catchment area. 26. The University made Further Submissions on 13 November 2018. It said it was not suggesting that Mr Peters himself was a motivated intruder but the unusually low attendance records associated with CFS/ME would enable a match to be made with age and gender in the trial data. The number of individuals (including parents) and organisations with access to school attendance records might enable a motivated intruder using investigative techniques or advertising to access the records. Removal of age and gender would make the data worthless. 827. Mr Peters responded by his witness statement. He said he was not aware of any attempts to identify participants in the SMILE trial (or indeed of PACE participants, including after some PACE data was released). Those who had self-identified as participants in PACE had, he believed, met only with support from other patients, and those who used pseudonyms had faced no pressure to identify or attempts at identification. The Commissioner had accepted that school attendance records had a motivated defender 12 and her finally finely balanced decision therefore depended on the University explaining how information from other sources could be used. It had not done so. Similarly, the University had not explained what investigation techniques or advertising could lead to reidentification. To suggest that someone entrusted with school records would hand them over on seeing an advertisement was implausible to say the least, Mr Peters argued. Discussion The legislation 28. At the time of the request, section 40 FOIA read: ‘(2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if – (a) It constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) Either the first or the second condition below is satisfied (3)The first condition is- (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene – (i) any of the data protection principles …’ 29. Section 1(1) DPA defined ‘personal data’ as: ‘data which relate to a living individual who can be identified – (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual’. It is paragraph (b) which is in issue in the present case. Paragraph (a) does not apply because Mr Peters has asked for the information in anonymised form. 12 See para 44 of the Commissioner’s Response 9(The definition refers to data which can be ‘identified’. However, the parties sometimes use the term ‘reidentified’, presumably on the basis that the trial participants have already been identified (to those running the trial), and the Tribunal will therefore also use ‘reidentified’ and ‘reidentification’). 30. ‘Data controller’ was defined as ‘… a person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be processed’. ‘Processing’ included disclosure. There is no dispute that the requested information falls within the definition of ‘data’. A ‘data subject’ is a person who is the subject of personal data. 31. Section 2 defined ‘sensitive personal data’. It related to personal data consisting of information about, inter alia, physical or mental health or condition. It follows that data which is not personal cannot be sensitive personal data. Does the requested information ‘relate to’ a living individual? 32. It clearly does. This part of the definition of ‘personal data’ therefore applies. The key question is that of reidentification. The reference to ‘data controller’ in paragraph (b) of the definition of ‘personal data’ 33. On its face, paragraph (b) of the definition of ‘personal data’ only applies where reidentification is possible from a combination of the data in question (here, the requested information) and data which is in, or likely to come into, the possession of the data controller. Where data is held by an organisation, the data controller will, almost inevitably, be an employee. The reference to other data in the data controller’s possession (or likely to become so), not on other data which might be generally available or at least accessible by a motivated intruder, appears to suggest that the circumstances in which reidentification could apply via the paragraph (b) extension are limited. That in turn would narrow the definition of ‘personal data’, which would then mean that the protection of privacy rights via the data protection principles in the DPA 1998 would be correspondingly limited. 34. However, caselaw has determined that one must ask whether reidentification is possible from a combination of the data in question and data otherwise available, not simply to the data controller. For example, in Department of Health, Mr Justice Cranston explained that, in Common Services Agency, the House of Lords had said that, even though the data controller holds the key to identification of individuals to which the data relates, whether data is personal depends on ‘whether any living individuals can be identified by the public [i.e. not simply the data controller] 10following disclosure of the information’.13 The Upper Tribunal confirmed that that was the correct approach in Information Commissioner v Magherafelt District Council.14 35. The issue is therefore whether the trial participants could be reidentified from a combination of the requested information and other information which is or might be generally accessible, not simply possessed (or likely to be possessed) by the data controller. That is certainly consistent with recital (26) of the directive. 15 The motivated intruder test 36. The term ‘motivated intruder’ is not found in the legislation. It seems to come from the Code. The reference to ‘intruder’ is perhaps unfortunate, because it suggests someone who is prepared to take the law into their own hands to reidentify a data subject. In fact, a motivated intruder is not a lawbreaker. Presumably what is meant is someone who has no compunction about being intrusive about particular personal information. In any event, the term has received judicial sanction and is now an established part of the data protection lexicon. 37. In Information Commissioner v Miller, 16 Upper Tribunal Judge Markus summarised the caselaw and quoted, with evident approval, from the Code: ‘11. In the Department of Health case Cranston J said at paragraph 66 that the assessment of the likelihood of identification included “assessing a range of every day factors, such as the likelihood that particular groups, such as campaigners, and the press, will seek out information of identity and the types of other information, already in the public domain, which could inform the search.” 12. As for the likelihood of identification, Recital 26 of the preamble to the Directive [95/46/EC] provides that “account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used”. In Magherafelt the Upper Tribunal acknowledged the “motivated intruder” test advanced by the Information Commissioner: “37 …A ‘motivated intruder’ was ‘…a person who starts without any prior knowledge but who wishes to identify the individual or individuals referred to in the purportedly anonymised information and will take all reasonable steps to do so.’. The question was then one of assessment by a public authority as to ‘… whether, taking account of the nature of the information, there would be likely to be a motivated intruder within the public at large who would be able to identify the individuals to whom the disclosed information relates.’ 13. While not expressly adopting that test, the approach of the Upper Tribunal in that case was consistent with it. A similar approach was taken by the Court of Session 13 Para 52 14 [2013] AACR 14 15 ‘Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable …’ 16 [2018] UKUT 229 (AAC) 11(Inner House) in Craigdale Housing Association v The Scottish Information Commissioner [2010] CSIH 43 at paragraph 24: “…it is not just the means reasonably likely to be used by the ordinary man on the street to identify a person, but also the means which are likely to be used by a determined person with a particular reason to want to identify the individual…using the touchstone of, say, an investigative journalist…” 14. The Information Commissioner’s Code of Practice on “Anonymisation: managing data protection risk” provides guidance at page 22/23 on the application of the “motivated intruder” test: “The approach assumes that the ‘motivated intruder’ is reasonably competent, has access to resources such as the internet, libraries, and all public documents, and would employ investigative techniques such as making enquiries of people who may have additional knowledge of the identity of the data subject or advertising for anyone with information to come forward. The ‘motivated intruder’ is not assumed to have any specialist knowledge such as computer hacking skills, or to have access to specialist equipment or to resort to criminality such as burglary, to gain access to data that is kept securely.” 15. The guidance also addresses the risk of re-identification where one individual or group of individuals already knows a great deal about another individual, such as a family member, colleague or doctor, and says at page 26: “The starting point for assessing re-identification risk should be recorded information and established fact. It is easier to establish that particular recorded information is available, than to establish that an individual – or group of individuals - has the knowledge necessary to allow re-identification. However, there is no doubt that non-recorded personal knowledge, in combination with anonymised data, can lead to identification. It can be harder though to substantiate or argue convincingly. There must be a plausible and reasonable basis for non-recorded personal knowledge to be considered to present a significant re-identification risk.” 16. The guidance also distinguishes between identification and an educated guess: “[Identification] implies a degree of certainty that information is about one person and not another. Identification involves more than making an educated guess that information is about someone; the guess could be wrong. The possibility of making an educated guess about an individual’s identity may present a privacy risk but not a data protection one because no personal data has been disclosed to the guesser. Even where a guess based on anonymised data turns out to be correct, this does not mean that a disclosure of personal data has taken place’” (the judge’s emphasis). 38. The Code adds 17 that one should assume that the motivated intruder is reasonably competent and might advertise for anyone with relevant information to come forward. The test was useful ‘because it sets the bar for the risk of identification higher than considering whether a “relatively inexpert” member of the public can achieve re-identification, but lower than considering whether someone with access to a great deal of specialist expertise, analytical power or prior knowledge could do so’. 17 p22 1239. The key elements of the motivated intruder test are therefore as follows: • The intruder starts without any prior knowledge • He or she will have a particular reason to identify the subjects of anonymised data and will take all reasonable steps to do so, will be determined and competent, will have access to resources such as the internet, libraries and public documents but will not resort to criminality (such as computer hacking or burglary) • He or she is similar to an investigative journalist but will not have specialist equipment • Non-recorded personal knowledge can suffice but there must be a plausible and reasonable basis for believing that such knowledge presents a significant re- identification risk • There must be a likelihood of success • Educated guesswork does not suffice. Should one assume that there is a motivated intruder in a particular case? 40. The caselaw is not altogether clear as to whether it is necessary to assess in a particular case whether there is in fact likely to be a motivated intruder, anxious to reidentify the subjects of the requested data, or whether one should simply assume that there is and then assess whether a hypothetical motivated intruder would be likely to be able to reidentify data subjects. 41. This matters in the present case because Mr Peters asserts, with some cogency, that no one would have any desire to find out who the trial participants were. Campaigners such as himself simply wish to access the trial’s raw data in order to assess whether the trial is methodologically sound and whether the conclusions which have been drawn are justified by the data. He points to the experience of the PCAE trial, where, he says, no attempts have been made to identify anonymous participants and no pressure has been put on self-identifiers. It should be said, however, that a motivated intruder might not just be drawn from CFS/ME campaigners. 42. In the Tribunal’s view, there has to be an assessment of whether there is at least a realistic possibility of a motivated intruder in a particular case. Otherwise, a requester might be denied information to which he or she would otherwise be entitled simply because of a risk which was not grounded in reality. This is consistent with the dictum of Mr Justice Cranston in Department of Health that 13assessing the likelihood of reidentification included ‘… the likelihood that particular groups such as campaigners and the press will seek out information of identify … ‘. 43. Ultimately, it does not matter in the present case whether a motivated intruder is likely: the Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that it is (albeit that the University accepts that Mr Peters does not himself don the mantle). The standard of proof 44. As with all issues under FOIA, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: on the balance of probabilities, is there a reasonable likelihood of reidentification from a combination of the requested data and other data? 45. That said, the balance of probabilities standard is flexible: in some situations the bar is higher than in others, reflecting the relative gravity of getting the judgements in question wrong. The confidentiality of clinical trial data, like other patient information, is a very important public good. There is a strong public interest in encouraging participation in trials, and patients would be deterred if they feared that their medical data might become public knowledge without their consent. The sensitivity of the medical data of children might not be any greater than that of adults, but it is certainly not any lesser. The University is behaving entirely responsibly in wishing to protect participants’ confidentiality. The Tribunal, whilst remaining faithful to the balance of probabilities standard, has therefore paid anxious scrutiny to whether there is a reasonable likelihood of reidentification. 46. However, the University asked itself the wrong question when conducting its internal review [57]: ‘The university must be certain that the release of the requested information could not lead to the re-identification of the research participants’ (emphasis added). That sets the bar too high. In its Response, the University adjusted its position – asking in paragraph 15 whether there was a real risk that a motivated intruder might be able successfully to identify some, if not all, of the trial participants – but then came close to repeating its original error when it suggested, in paragraph 20, that ‘even a small risk of reidentification of a single child participant would be unacceptable in this context’. As already noted, its aversion to risk is understandable but the avoidance of even a small risk is not the correct threshold. As the Commissioner correctly says in her Code, 18 ‘[t]he DPA is not framed in terms of the possibility of an individual being identified. Its definition of personal data is based on the identification or likely identification of an individual … ‘ (her emphasis). 18 p16 14Is the motivated intruder test satisfied? 47. The University puts its case squarely on triangulation of the trial data (falling within the requested information) and school attendance records. It has not responded to the Commissioner’s prompt of demonstrating a realistic risk of triangulation via social media blogs and forums or other sources of information. 48. Mr Peters says his understanding is that the participants came from Bristol and Bath, which would mean the pool of possible schools would be around 60. In his Reply to the University’s Response, he quotes from the feasibility paper for the trial (not in the bundle): ‘Children were recruited between October 2010 and June 2012 at initial clinical assessment appointments conducted by Bath and Bristol specialist paediatric CFS/ME service …’. The University says that the recruitment centre was based in Bath and most of the children were recruited from that city. It believed that the number of schools from which participants were recruited was between three and nine at any one time, mainly from the Bath area. 49. Of course, the University must be taken to know where participants came from (although it does not claim that all came from Bath and the RUH in fact attracts CFS/ME patients from all over the UK and Western Europe). Ultimately, however, the precise delineation of the catchment area is not determinative, for the following reasons. First and foremost, even if the motivated intruder knew which schools or group of schools to target, there is no reason to believe that he or she would be able to access the school attendance records. Attendance records are confidential and, as the Commissioner has noted, would therefore have motivated defenders, in the schools holding them. It is true that some other bodies may be given access, but those bodies would equally be bound by confidentiality. Parents would only be entitled to know their own child’s attendance record. As Mr Peters has said, the University has not explained what (lawful) investigative techniques a motivated intruder might employ to access school records and it is not credible that a school would simply respond to an advertisement. The trial started some eight years ago such that, as Mr Peters suggests, some of the records might well by now have been archived. 50. But, second, even if the motivated intruder was able to get hold of school records, that would not enable him or her to identify the trial participants. The University says that mean school attendance for teenagers attending a specialist CFS/ME service is 40% (two days a week), an exceptionally low individual attendance rate such that the children would stand out clearly in any school attendance records. However, that does not mean that only children with CFS/ME have such low attendance records. Sadly, there are a number of childhood diseases which can lead to low attendance. Children undergoing chemotherapy, for example, are often unable to attend much school for long periods. Simply noting that a particular child had a poor attendance record would not tell the motivated intruder that the 15child must have CFS/ME (school attendance records would not identify the condition from which a child was suffering 19). As the Code, in a passage endorsed by UTJ Marcus, makes clear, an educated guess, even if justified here, would not be sufficient. 51. Third, even if the motivated intruder was entitled to assume that an entry showing a poor attendance record meant that the child had CFS/ME, the record would not indicate whether the child was on the SMILE trial. The University’s press release says that the RUH assesses and treats over 400 children from across the UK and Western Europe every year. Only a relatively small proportion of the patient pool for the years in question would have been on the trial and the motivated intruder could have no idea which children with poor attendance records were on the trial. Indeed, Prof Crawley is quoted as saying in the press release that ‘[m]any children and families in our service did not want to have LP …’. They cannot, therefore, have consented to take part in a trial in which they might be randomised into receiving LP. But their attendance records would be just as poor. 52. The University is therefore wrong to say, in paragraph 7 of its Further Submissions, that ‘any child with unusually low attendance would be immediately identifiable as a likely trial participant’, particularly given that age and gender are out of scope. Self-evidently, a motivated intruder would have had no incentive to obtain attendance records which would not give the reidentifying information sought. 53. The Tribunal has taken account of the fact that the requested information contains individual patient detail (as opposed to being aggregated or further anonymised). However, the fact remains that reidentification would not be possible via school attendance records (even if obtainable) and the University has not identified any other vehicle. Is the fact that the University is making the trial data available to researchers as controlled data relevant to the personal data issue? 54. It is not. It is no doubt laudable that the University is willing to share information with other researchers but it is not relevant to the question whether the requested information constitutes personal data. Whether sharing of information in this way satisfies any legitimate public interest in it, as the University suggests in paragraph 22 of its Response, misses the point. 19 The University, in paragraph 16 of its Response, says that school attendance records distinguish between, for example, children who are truanting and those with medical reasons to miss school, but it does not suggest that the medical reason is given 16Conclusion on the personal data issue 55. The Tribunal has concluded that the requested information does not constitute personal data, because the trial participants could not be identified from a combination of the requested information and other information which a motivated intruder could access with reasonable likelihood. 56. Because the requested information is not personal data, it cannot be sensitive personal data either. 57. It follows that the exemption in section 40(2) FOIA is not available to the University. It has not claimed any other exemption. Would DPP1 have applied? 58. Had the requested information constituted personal data, the Tribunal would have had to consider whether any of the data protection principles, and in particular DPP1, would have been breached by disclosure. Although it does not make a definitive ruling, it is likely that the Tribunal would have decided that DPP1 would have been breached, and in particular that condition 6(1) of schedule 2 did not apply. Mr Peters has identified a legitimate interest in seeing the trial data – in particular, assessing whether a trial which might well influence treatment decisions for children suffering from a common and debilitating condition represents good science – but this is probably outweighed by the strong need to protect the identity of the trial participants and the confidentiality of their medical data. The limited sharing of the data with other researchers would have been relevant to the condition 6(1) balancing exercise. Would the result be any different under the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)? 59. Paragraph 52 of schedule 20 to the DPA 2018 provides: ‘(1) This paragraph applies where a request for information was made to a public authority under the 2000 Act before the relevant time. (2) To the extent that the request is dealt with after the relevant time, the amendments of sections 2 and 40 of the 2000 Act in Schedule 19 to this Act have effect for the purposes of determining whether the authority deals with the request in accordance with Part 1 of the 2000 Act. (3) To the extent that the request was dealt with before the relevant time— (a) the amendments of sections 2 and 40 of the 2000 Act in Schedule 19 to this Act do not have effect for the purposes of determining whether the authority dealt with the request in accordance with Part 1 of the 2000 Act, but 17(b) the powers of the Commissioner and the Tribunal, on an application or appeal under the 2000 Act, do not include power to require the authority to take steps which it would not be required to take in order to comply with Part 1 of the 2000 Act as amended by Schedule 19 to this Act. (4) In this paragraph— “public authority” has the same meaning as in the 2000 Act; “the relevant time” means the time when the amendments of sections 2 and 40 of the 2000 Act in Schedule 19 to this Act come into force’. 60. In other words, although Mr Peters’ request must be dealt with under DPA 1998 (because it was processed prior to the coming into force of DPA 2018) the Tribunal should not order the disclosure of the requested information if that would not be consistent with DPA 2018. In the Tribunal’s judgment, the result would be the same under DPA 2018 and there is therefore no bar to disclosure. 20 Conclusion 61. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed. The decision is unanimous. Because they are outside the scope of the request, the University does not need to disclose age and gender. Signed David Thomas Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 11 March 2019 Promulgated: 12 March 2019 20 Article 4(1) of the GDPR, incorporated by section 5 DPA 2018, defines ‘personal data’ as ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person’.

"10","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0183 and 0184 Heard at Fleetbank House on 25 February 2019 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Pieter de Waal Michael Jones Between Iain Orr Appellant and The Information Commissioner 1st Respondent and Department for International Development 2nd Respondent The Appellant represented himself The Information Commissioner was unrepresented 1The Department for International Development (DFID) was represented by Ms Galina Ward DECISION AND REASONS Introduction 1. These two appeals relate to the Appellant’s requests to DFID for information about (i) the terms of reference for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by an external expert appointed by DFID; and (ii) information about flight tests undertaken to measure turbulence and wind shear before agreeing the location, design and runway alignment of the airport. The Commissioner explained the background in both the decisions under challenge as follows:- 2. St Helena is a small self-governing UK overseas territory in the South Atlantic, previously only accessible by sea. DFID provides financial and technical assistance to St Helena as one of three Overseas Territories which are eligible for official development assistance. 3. DFID’s aims for the UK’s financially dependent Overseas Territories are to ensure the provision of basic services and to help them become economically self-sufficient, with the aim of reducing and eventually removing the need for subsidies from the UK government. 4. In 2004, DFID commissioned a feasibility study into building an airport on St Helena, with the rationale that improved access would help reverse economic decline by opening the island to increased revenues from tourism. In 2010, DFID commissioned a report from consultants looking at options for access to improve St Helena’s economic and social sustainability. In 2011, the St Helena Government signed a design, build and operate fixed price contract with Basil Read, a South African construction company to build an airport on St Helena. The total budget for the project was set at £285.5 million. 5. The airport had planned to start operating in May 2016. However, test flights in April 2016 revealed dangerous wind conditions on the airport approach, an effect known as ‘wind shear’. Although the airport subsequently handled a small number of flights, the wind conditions precluded the operation of the planned commercial service. These began 2in October 2017 following further testing of the wind conditions on the island. 6. The House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts published a report in December 2016 about the St Helena Airport project. The report was critical of DFID’s management of the project, in particular its failure to foresee and address the impact of difficult wind conditions on landing commercial aircraft safely. Preliminary 2. DFID made an application at the start of the hearing, pursuant to rule 14(6) of the Tribunal rules, that certain parts of the witness statement of Mr John Gordon (discussed in detail below) and other documents (not those within the scope of the requests) should be withheld on the basis that they explain how release of the disputed material at the time the requests were made would have adversely affected the course of justice. We accept DFID’s submission that ‘Releasing details of the dispute now would undermine the ...process which has rightly existed for this extended period in order to ensure that the Department could achieve the best outcome possible’. The nature of the dispute referred to is described in the body of the decision below. In those circumstances that application was granted. The requests and response 3. The Appellant submitted the following request to DFID on 22 October 2017: ‘This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Regulations for full information of the terms of reference and any subsequent instructions - including the allocation of supporting financial, legal and human resources - for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by [name redacted], as indicated by the DFID Secretary of State when she told the International Development Committee on 19 December 2016: ‘I have appointed an external individual expert to undertake a detailed review of the project and programme. I think that is right. That, to me, speaks to transparency and value for money.’ 3""Please also provide information on when [name redacted] work was completed; or, if not yet completed, whether there is a date by which he has been asked or is expected to complete and present this review."" 4. DFID’s initial response on 20 November 2017 was to refuse to confirm or deny whether it held any information on the basis of regulations 12(3) and 13(2)(a) (personal data exceptions) of the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). The Appellant contacted DFID on 1 December 2017 and asked for an internal review of this response. His email also asked: ‘Would it help if the question were rephrased? Eg: “This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act, for full information of the terms of reference and any subsequent instructions for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by an external individual expert appointed by the DFID Secretary of State, as she informed the International Development Select Committee on 19 December 2016. Please also provide information on whether this detailed review has been completed or, if not, whether there is a date by which the external expert has been asked - or is expected - to complete it."" 5. The Appellant then included some clarifications of his new formulation, which in fact appear to refer to matters upon which he was hoping for disclosure which go beyond that which was included in either of the formulations of the request set out above. The Appellant said: That formulation is shorter, purely to avoid further misinterpretations. Let me make explicit that I do not expect ‘full information’ to include any sums to be paid into any individual’s personal bank account. It would, however, be helpful to know if the expert was given a budget for this ‘detailed review’, including, for example, provision for supporting staff or for any visit to St Helena; as well as other expenses to facilitate access to UK and St Helena officials and commercial companies who have at any stage been involved in the project. I would, of course, understand if names of individuals or companies were redacted - for good reasons, such as protecting personal data – from the terms of reference and subsequent instructions given to the reviewer. Given earlier delays and misinterpretations, I would be grateful if DFID’s review of this further refusal could be completed as speedily as 4possible; and if you could also confirm now (before starting your review) that you understand from my suggested rewording that I am not seeking any personal data whose disclosure is not permitted under the FOIA.’ 6. After a number of further contacts DFID provided a substantive response on 1 February 2018 when it said:- (a) The request fell under the Environmental Information Regulations. (b) DFID confirmed that it held a copy of the Terms of Reference (ToR) and that the review had been completed. (c) DFID confirmed that the overall budget allocated to the expert was £29,750 of which £19,663 was paid inclusive of VAT and all travel expenses. (d) However, DFID considered the actual ToR to be exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(a) EIR (adverse effect on international relations), 12(5)(b) EIR (course of justice) and 12(5)(e) EIR (confidentiality of commercial and industrial information). 7. The Appellant also submitted the following request to DFID on 22 October 2017: ‘This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations, for information about: [i.] test flights undertaken to measure turbulence and wind shear, as recommended by Atkins in Section 7.57 of their report on the St Helena airport and [ii.] about the decision to discontinue such flights after the first one had been completed.’ 8. In relation to this request, DFID responded on 20 November 2017. In relation to (i), DFID explained that it held information falling within the scope of this request but considered it to be exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(b) and 12(5)(e) EIR. 59. In relation to (ii), DFID explained that it did not hold any information falling within the scope of this request. This was on the basis that ‘the original plan only intended for one test flight to be undertaken. Therefore, no “decision” was ever made to “discontinue such flights after the first one had been completed”. 10. Following a request by the Appellant for DFID to carry out an internal review of the decision, DFID informed him of the outcome of the internal review on 12 January 2018 as follows:- (a) With regard to request (i), DFID remained of the view that the entirety of the information falling within the scope of this request, namely a document entitled ‘Flight Trials Report’ dated May 2007, was exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(b) and 12(5)(e) EIR. (b) DFID concluded that this document was also exempt on the basis of regulations 12(5)(a) (international relations) and 12(3) and 13(2)(a) EIR. (c) Additional searches had been carried out in relation to (ii), including searches to see if there was information as to why there was only one day of flight-trialling completed at the pre-design stage of developing the St Helena Air Access project, and no information had been located. Therefore ref 12 (4)(a) EIR was relied upon. 11. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner about the way his requests had been dealt with. The Commissioner dealt with the complaint primarily by considering the exception in regulation 12(5)(b) EIR which relates materially to a situation where disclosure would adversely affect ‘the course of justice or the ability of a person to receive a fair trial…’. 6Relevant legislation 12. The relevant parts of regulation 12 EIR reads as follows:- 12.— Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if– (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. (3) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that– (a) it does not hold that information when an applicant's request is received (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect– (a) international relations, defence, national security or public safety (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; …. (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest; Decision notices 13. We adopt what the Commissioner said about reg 12(5)(b) EIR in the relevant decision notices as follows:- 7The threshold for establishing adverse effect is a high one, since it is necessary to establish that disclosure would have an adverse effect. ‘Would’ means that it is more probable than not, ie a more than 50% chance that the adverse effect would occur if the information were disclosed. If there is a less than 50% chance of the adverse effect occurring, then the exception is not engaged. The course of justice element of this exception is very wide in coverage, and can encompass, amongst other types of information, material covered by legal professional privilege (LPP). 14. In the first request case (the ToR request) the Commissioner concluded as follows:- (a) The ToR attracted legal professional privilege (LPP), specifically litigation privilege, and therefore disclosure of the privileged material would have an adverse effect on the course of justice for the purposes of reg 12(5)(b) EIR. (b) That although there was a significant public interest in the disclosure of the information, given the criticisms of the airport project, the public interest in maintaining the exemption was greater because of the need to maintain the principles of LPP, and the acute impact on the course of justice where the disputed information related to live legal proceedings. 13. The Commissioner reached a slightly different conclusion in the second case (the Flight Trials request) and found that although the information did not attract LPP:- Nevertheless, the Commissioner is satisfied that disclosure of this information still risks undermining DFID’s position in the ongoing legal case. Moreover, the Commissioner is satisfied that such a risk could be categorised as harming the course of justice given the broad way in which this concept is interpreted when applying this 8exception. Furthermore, the Commissioner is satisfied that the likelihood of harm occurring if the withheld information was disclosed is one that meets the threshold of more probable than not. She is therefore satisfied that regulation 12(5)(b) is engaged. The Commissioner has elaborated on her reasons for reaching this conclusion in a confidential annex, a copy of which will be provided to DFID only. 14. Much the same analysis was carried out by the Commissioner as in the ToR request decision, in deciding that the public interest favoured non- disclosure. 15. In relation to the Appellant’s argument that there must be further information about the decision to discontinue the test flights after the first such flight, the Commissioner accepted DFID’s response that it had carried out relevant searches and there was no further information held, and that therefore regulation 12(4)(a) EIR was correctly relied upon by DFID. The appeals 16. The Appellant appealed both these decisions. 17. In essence, in relation to the ToR request, the Appellant argued that the balance of the public interest had been wrongly struck in favour of non- disclosure, and that it was unfair that there was closed material in the case that he was unable to see. 18. In relation to the Flight Trials request, the Appellant argued that reg 12(5)(b) EIR had been wrongly applied, and that disclosure would not lead to an adverse effect on the course of justice. He argued that it was implausible that DFID did not hold further information in relation to ceasing of the flight trials, and criticised the lack of breadth of the searches that had been carried out by DFID. 9Subsequent developments 19. Matters have now moved on. The first thing that happened was that DFID prepared a statement dated 11 January 2019 from Mr John Gordon, who is Head of the Overseas Territories Department at DFID. That statement is heavily redacted in places, but the open part of the statement explained that DFID no longer relied on litigation privilege for withholding the ToR and therefore did not support the Commissioner’s finding on this issue. This was as a result of ‘[h]aving considered all the contemporaneous documents surrounding the creation of the ToR’. Mr Gordon explained that:- It is certainly the case that a primary purpose of the ToR was to help identify any negligence by DFID’s third party advisors and provide critical insights for consideration of possible legal action…But this was not the only purpose: other purposes included assisting in identifying a solution to the problems faced, and considering whether DFID’s internal processes had been sufficiently robust in dealing with the matter. I am not now able, based on my review of the documents, to say that any of these was the dominant purpose of the ToR. 20. However, Mr Gordon goes on to explain that DFID continued with its reliance on reg 12(5)(b) EIR on the basis that disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice. The full reasons for this have been redacted and are only available in a closed version of the statement. 21. There have been further developments. DFID now says that all the information requested has, in fact, been disclosed. In its skeleton argument for the hearing it says, in relation to the ToR request, that the ToR itself was provided to the Appellant on 30 January 2019. 22. In relation to the Flight Trials request, DFID reaffirmed that it does not hold any information in relation to the decision to discontinue test flights after the first one had been completed as only one test flight was recommended. The information about the test flight that was carried out is contained in the Flight 10Trials Report (FTR) which has now also been provided to the Appellant on 30 January 2019. 23. DFID supports the initial decisions made in relation to the requests as, at that time, it was engaged in a live dispute in which Government Legal Division commercial litigation section had been instructed and it was concerned that disclosure of the FTR and ToR would prejudice the effective conduct of that dispute. That position was time sensitive and was kept under review, with the result that it was concluded that the information should be released on 30 January 2019. 24. It is argued that this disclosure decision does not undermine DFID’s previous position, ‘but rather underlines the careful consideration that was given to the relevant issues at all times’. The hearing 25. At the hearing, DFID applied to have the appeal struck out on the basis that it was ‘academic’ now that the information had been disclosed. That application was refused and there is a separate judgment which deals with that point. 26. The main point that the Appellant wanted to make was that, in his view, there must be more information within the scope of the requests that DFID should disclose, especially in relation to ‘further instructions’ following the ToR, and further information about discontinuance of the flight trials. 27. He also submitted that the exemption in reg 12(5)(b) EIR had been wrongly applied in relation to both requests. 28. Although DFID had served the statement of Mr John Gordon, Mr Gordon did not attend to give oral evidence. We explained to the Appellant that in these circumstances the Tribunal would consider the weight to be given to 11the statement, in the light of submissions made by the Appellant. We should also note that much of the witness statement was redacted and so it could only be considered at the hearing by the Tribunal in a closed session with DFID’s representative. 29. That closed session took place and at the end of it a gist was provided to the Appellant to the effect that the Tribunal had been taken to passages in Mr Gordon’s statement that explained the nature of the confidential dispute resolution procedure that DFID was engaged in, and the reasons why DFID was concerned that disclosure of the requested information would have had an adverse impact on that process. The gist stated that the Tribunal had asked questions to test the substance of DFID’s concerns. The Tribunal also looked at the material that had been subject to a s14(6) FOIA order, to see whether it assisted in identifying the extent of the searches carried out by DFID. Discussion The ToR appeal 30. In relation to the ToR appeal it was not strictly a point in issue as to whether DFID held further information that it had not disclosed. This is because the appeal relates to the Commissioner’s decision as to whether DFID can rely on the exemption in reg 12(5)(b) EIR or not in relation to the information requested. DFID says that it has now disclosed the information in scope. However, we do note that DFID says that there were no further ‘instructions’ issued in relation to the ToR, and we have no reason to doubt that. We note that that does not mean that there is necessarily no further information at all which relates to the ToR, simply that there is nothing that can be described as ‘instructions’ so as to be within the scope of the request 1231. In relation to the ToR request, DFID initially claimed the protection of reg 12(5)(b) EIR on the basis that the ToR were covered by LPP. LPP constitutes the rules which seek to protect the confidentiality of legal communications. There are two types of LPP – legal advice privilege and litigation privilege – and DFID claimed that the latter applied to the ToR. For litigation privilege to apply there must be confidential communications or documents which were created for the dominant purpose of litigation. The Commissioner explained DFID’s initial position as follows at paragraph 16 of the decision notice:- DFID explained that the withheld information attracted LPP and was relevant to a live and ongoing legal case. It argued that disclosure of the withheld information would provide an indication of arguments relevant to this case, the strength or weaknesses which DFID might have, thus unbalancing the level playing field under which adversarial proceedings are meant to be carried out. DFID was of the opinion that disclosure of the withheld information would therefore harm the course of justice. 32. With reference to the withheld information in this case, the Commissioner was of the view that DFID’s claim to LPP was made out. On the basis of Mr Gordon’s statement (as described above) it seems to us that that conclusion can no longer be maintained. However, it also seems to us that all Mr Gordon is saying in his statement is that there was more than one primary purpose for creating the ToR, which necessarily rules out the reliance on LPP. But given the wording of regulation 12(5)(b) EIR (which means that the exemption applies where disclosure would ‘adversely affect… the course of justice’) DFID, in our view, is still able to rely on the factors as summarised by the Commissioner in paragraph 16 of the decision notice, for the purposes of withholding the ToR at the time the request was made. 33. We have had the benefit of considering the withheld material in this case, reading the unredacted witness statement of Mr Gordon, and receiving closed oral submissions, and we are satisfied that the regulation 12(5)(b) EIR exemption applies, notwithstanding that litigation privilege is now accepted 13to have been wrongly claimed. It seems clear to us that the ToR were contained in a confidential document which was produced for a primary purpose (albeit not the primary purpose) of litigation, and that disclosure at the time of the request would have adversely affected the course of justice (that is, that there was a greater than 50% chance that the adverse effect would occur) while resolution of the dispute was at issue. 34. Although we have considered closed documentation and submissions, there is now a fair amount of information available to the Appellant to explain DFID’s position (and our conclusion) and the Appellant is now able to read the contents of the ToR document itself. Thus:- (a) As mentioned in the open ‘gist’ (see above), DFID have explained that they were engaged in a confidential dispute resolution process. (b) Mr Gordon, in the open part of his statement, explains the context of possible legal action for negligence against third party advisors. (c) Paragraph 16 of the decision notice summarises further the position as to why disclosure would have harmed the course of justice. 35. In these circumstances it does not seem to us that we need to expand on our conclusion in a closed annex to this decision. 36. However, that is not the end of the matter, as the exemption in reg 12(1)(b) EIR requires that, where it is engaged, a test should be carried out to ascertain whether the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. As the Commissioner notes in the decision notice, the provisions of regulation 12(2) EIR state that a public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure, and as a Tribunal, we must do the same. 1437. As emphasised by the Appellant, there is an obvious public interest in disclosing as much information as possible about public expenditure where it appears that there is a strong argument that something went seriously wrong with the commissioning and planning of the airport at St Helena, and the need to understand exactly what happened. The Appellant argues that the Public Accounts Committee’s report into the planning of St Helena Airport project contained a damning assessment of the project. We agree with the Commissioner that disclosure of the ToR ‘would provide the public with an insight into the steps DFID has taken to investigate how the project was managed’. 38. In the decision notice the Commissioner was able to rely on the ‘clear and significant public interest in upholding the long-established principle of legal professional privilege’ when deciding where the public interest balance should be struck. Now that the claim for LPP is not being relied upon by DFID, the Tribunal cannot take exactly the same route. However, we do still give significant weight to the public interest in avoiding an adverse effect on the course of justice, having found that disclosure would have had that effect. 39. In particular, as noted, a primary purpose of the ToR was to provide a basis for possible legal action against third party advisors and at the time of the request there was an ongoing confidential dispute resolution procedure in which DFID was engaged. It seems to us that at the time of the request, there was a greater public interest in enabling the course of justice to continue, rather than in disclosing the ToR. Of course, there came a time when the position changed and the information was disclosed, but that post-dated the relevant decision-making which we have to consider. 40. On that basis we do not allow the appeal in relation to the ToR. The Flight Trials request 1541. We have come to a different conclusion in relation to the Flight Trials request. As Mr Gordon sets out in his open statement, and as we can now see from the disclosed report, the report relates to flight trials carried out in May 2006. It has never been argued that LPP attached to this document. It cannot be argued that the purpose of the FTR was in any way related to possible litigation. We cannot find that disclosure of the FTR at the time of the request would have adversely affected the course of litigation (that is, that there was a greater than 50% chance that this would occur), and therefore the exception in reg 12(5)(b) EIR does not apply. There is nothing in the withheld material that leads us to a different conclusion. 42. Having reached this conclusion, in our view it is unnecessary for us to consider the public interest test. 43. Other than an issue about personal data (which we address below), we do not understand that any other exception is now relied upon by DFID. 44. In relation to the Appellant’s argument that DFID had not carried out sufficient searches in relation to the discontinuation of the flight trials, we accept the evidence from Mr Gordon in his statement as to the searches that were carried out, and that these searches contained the appropriate search terms for the information. It also makes sense to us that, as has been explained, as only one test flight was planned, there would not be information available about the discontinuance of the flight tests. Personal data in the Flight Trials request 45. Having reached the conclusion that the FTR should have been disclosed at the time of the request, it is necessary for us to consider information which remains redacted on the FTR which was eventually disclosed in January 2019, on the basis that the redacted parts constitute personal data. DFID explains 16that it is relying on reg 12(3) and reg 13(2) EIR to withhold the personal data of three ‘observers’ on aircraft during the flight trials. DFID says:- ‘The information is personal data because it consists of names and details of the individuals’ flying experience and employment and so identifies the data subjects’. 46. Having considered the relevant material it seems to us that if names, years of experience, and specific employment details are redacted, then it ceases to be possible to identify individuals from it, and in which case the information disclosed ceases to be personal data which qualifies for possible exemption. 47. Thus, the relevant bullet points, under the heading ‘Observers’ would read:- There were three observers on the aircraft as follows:- • [Redacted] an ex RAF Sqn Ldr with [redacted] years experience in aviation and an expert in airport design [redacted]. • [Redacted] and ex RAF Wg Cdr with [redacted] years experience flying Hercules and other aircraft [redacted]. • [Redacted] from Air Safety Support International (ASSI), an experienced pilot [redacted]. 48. In conclusion, therefore, we allow the Appellant’s appeal in relation to the FTR, on the basis that reg 12(5)(b) EIR does not apply, and to the extent that the FTR is redacted as indicated above it does not include personal data for the purposes of reg 12(3) EIR.

The Fast Track Graduate Scheme is the primary route by which future senior civil servants enter their profession. The effective and fair administration of this scheme is consequently a matter of public importance. The Government is concerned to ensure this and each year a review of how the recruitment process is been conducted in that year is published as well as other studies commissioned by the Government. In February 2016 the Cabinet Office published a 146-page independent report containing detailed statistical analyses by the Bridge Group on recruitment into the Fast Stream Socio- Economic Diversity in the Fast Stream”. In the executive summary it stated: - “Senior colleagues in the Civil Service are actively engaged in efforts to secure socio- economic diversity in the Fast Stream, and many good practices are well developed. These include the collection and publication of socio-economic background (SEB) data, the removal of candidate screening criteria (e.g. UCAS points and university attended), the targeting of marketing activity based on campus diversity, and an internship programme exclusively for under-represented groups. Much progress has been made in relation to some diversity indicators, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and disability. However, in relation to socio-economic diversity, the Fast Stream is unrepresentative of the population at large. To put this in context, the profile of the intake is less diverse than the student population at the University of Oxford.” 2. In response, the late Sir Jeremy Heywood (then Cabinet Secretary) wrote in the foreword to the report on the 2016 recruitment cycle Fast Stream and Early Talent Annual Report 2016: - In response the Civil Service has moved quickly to improve our processes and introduce important changes to how we attract, assess and support individuals into the Fast Stream These changes include…. …the application experience has been significantly improved since 2016, with the 2017 process completing several months faster than before… Many of these changes are too early to be covered in the period of this annual report. But I am confident that the actions we are taking will improve the diversity of the Civil Service now and in the years to come. That means a fairer, more meritocratic and more effective Civil Service and one the whole country can be proud of.”3. That report contained a 43 page detailed analysis of the recruitment covering analysis of the relative success of applicants by university of the applicant’s first degree, class of degree, type of degree, by gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, socio-economic status of parents of applicants, eligibility for free school meals, which part of the fast stream applicants had applied to, together with some trend data exploring how the these rates had shifted over a time, the amount of trend data varying according to the length of time that particular data had been captured. The request for information 4. The Appellant in these proceedings sought information on 25 February 2016. He withdrew the request (believing he had an alternative source of information from his position within the Civil Service) but when this was unavailing he renewed the request on 5 September 2016. He asked: - 1) Could you please break down for me the number of applicants recommended for appointment to the Diplomatic and Parliamentary Fast Streams by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended? I would like this data for as many year groups as you can provide, within the FoI cost limits. 2) If you have the information, the number of applicants that advanced to the Final Selection Board for the Diplomatic and Parliamentary Fast Streams by Socio- Economic Background and University Attended. Again, I would like this data for as many year groups as you can provide, within the FoI cost limits. 3) If you have the information, could you please also indicate which Department 'Central Department' Fast Stream entrants were posted to, for their first posting, broken down by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended? 4) If you have the information, could you please also indicate the geographical distribution of 'Central Departments' Fast Stream entrants' first postings, broken down by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended?” 5. The Cabinet Office provided links to some published information and confirmed that other information was exempt from disclosure under FOIA under s21 and s22 (information available by other means (s21) or meant for future publication (s22)). Following the intervention of the Information Commissioner the Cabinet Office disclosed tables of data with redactions made under s40(2) (the protection of personal information) and withheld information relating to University attended relying on s23(1) and s24 (1) in the alternative (It should be noted that the exemption provided for under s23 is an absolute exemption; that under s24 is subject to a public interest balancing test): - (23) Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters (1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the bodies specified in subsection (3)(24) National security (1) Information which does not fall within section 23(1) is exempt information if exemption from section 1(1)(b) is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.) 6. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner. During the course of her investigation the Appellant confirmed that in seeking the socioeconomic background of applicants he was seeking information concerning their parents’ occupations. The Commissioner’s Decision 7. In her decision notice the Commissioner referred to her published guidance How sections 23 and 24 interact which may permit the two exemptions to be relied on in the alternative: - “26… To overcome this problem the Commissioner will allow public authorities to cite both exemptions ‘in the alternative’ when necessary. This means that although only one of the two exemptions can actually be engaged, the public authority may refer to both exemptions in its refusal notice. 38. Where the Commissioner finds in favour of the public authority, the decision notice will not allude to which exemption has actually been applied. It will simply say that the Commissioner is satisfied that one of the two exemptions cited is engaged and that, if the exemption is section 24(1), the public interest favours withholding the information.” 8. The need for this approach is explained in the decision of the Information Tribunal Baker v Information Commissioner. Applying this approach, she confirmed that section 24(1) can be engaged, since it is a qualified exemption a balance must be struck between the competing claims of public interest. In weighing the public interest, she noted that given the information already in the public domain there was little public interest in disclosing this level of information and concluded (DN paragraph 28): - However, the Commissioner accepts that the public interest in protecting information required for the purposes of safeguarding national security is a very strong one, and in the circumstances of this case, she has concluded that, on balance, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 9. In considering the application of the s40 exemption the Commissioner considered the unredacted raw data tables held by the Cabinet Office (DN para 34): -The information comprises data tables breaking Fast Stream applicants down by department and occupational status of parent 1 and parent 2. These occupational statuses are further broken down into 10 categories. 10. Given the small numbers involved she considered that the risk of identifying individuals from the data was real. She applied the first data protection principle: - “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.” 11. She then considered the rights and expectations of the data subjects (DN para 38), whether there could be an over-riding public interest in disclosure (DN 39) the Cabinet Office’s account of how the data had come to be in the form it was (DN 40-44) – the information was not held by the Cabinet Office in the form requested and the information provided was created by the Cabinet Office’s contractor in response to the request. She also considered the consequences of disclosure: - 45 The Cabinet Office confirmed that it had considered aggregation of multiple years of data but the numbers remained unacceptably small and it considered disclosure of aggregated data would still constitute a breach of the DPA. 46. The Cabinet Office explained that if a staff member could be identified this would, in turn, reveal the occupational status of his or her parents. 12. The Appellant argued that recruitment statistics had been published for over a decade and he had made his request as two particular sections of the fast stream were omitted. He argued that applicants consented to the publication of information when they applied and there was a strong public interest in establishing accurately whether the Government was attempting to meet its own diversity targets. 13. The Commissioner noted that applications had been informed that statistical information would be anonymised before publication, considered that given the scale of the numbers involved individuals could be identified, and from that their parent’s occupations and considered that disclosure of the redacted information met the need for transparency without risk of breaching the data protection principles and upheld the position adopted by the Cabinet Office. The Appellant’s arguments 14. The Appellant argued misconduct by the Commissioner and Cabinet Office in that they “knowingly misapplied” S40(2), s23(1) and 24(1) of FOIA and breached his rights under Article 10 ECHR.15. With respect to s40 he argued that the fast Stream Annual Report had three categories for socio-economic status but that the Cabinet Office had provided data divided into 10 categories which was not sought and this resulted in a large number of small groups of individuals where the data was then redacted. Further the Annual Report disclosed some data related to groups of individuals as low as two; there was unjustifiable inconsistency. 16. There had been no proper explanation of how the Commissioner or Cabinet Office came to conclusions on s23(1) and s24(1). However, the Cabinet Office had already published the information in an amalgamated form, some individuals had already published the information about themselves, neither the Houses of Parliament nor Foreign and Commonwealth Office were bodies within s23. 17. It was established jurisprudence of the ECHR that Article 10 included a right to seek information from public bodies Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary and that the tests laid down for exercising this right were met by him. The Respondents’ position 18. In resisting the appeal, the Commissioner confirmed the analysis of the data protection issues in the decision notice, observing there was no obligation on the Cabinet Office to create further information if it did not hold it at the time of the request. She noted that whether individuals could be identified from as small a data set as two depended on the surrounding circumstances; she had reviewed the redactions and concluded there was a possibility of identification if the redactions were not made. She maintained her position with respect to S23 and S24. She submitted that the effect of UK jurisprudence was that rights under FOIA were not the route by which any potential Article 10 right to information could be realised and accordingly the decision in Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary was of no assistance to the Appellant. 19. The Cabinet Office supported the Commissioner. Evidence 20. The tribunal heard evidence from Gregory Hobbs; a senior civil servant in the Cabinet Office with responsibilities for the administration of the Fast Stream. He confirmed that the privacy notices associated with the Fast Stream meant that applicants would not expect to be publicly identified from information they provided during the recruitment process, nor would their parents expect to be so identified from information supplied by their children. While some hundreds are recruited through the process each year the vast majority are recruited into a system where they are encouraged to move between departments. However, for recruits into the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice or to the staff of Parliament there is no such expectation or mechanism. The Houses of Parliament Scheme recruits between 2 and 4 entrants each year and in these circumstances the triangulation of the various pieces of information sought could lead to the identification of individuals. 21. He explained that the Cabinet Office had released redacted data sets with respect to generalist fast stream entrants’ parental occupations and by location and a document giving the number of applications which proceeded to the final selection board for the diplomatic fast stream by parental occupation for the years 2013-2015. These documents were prepared from data held by a private sector contractor and redactions had been carried out where the number of applicants in any category was less than or equal to five. The disclosure of further information would involve a breach of s40. In cross- examination the witness was taken to the statistical tables published in the Fast Stream Annual Report where he explained that small numbers of applicants in certain areas would not be easily identifiable as they rotated through different departments. In closed session the tribunal explored the relationship between the material and the exemptions under s23(1) and s24(1). 22. In his submissions the Appellant considered the history of recruitment to the civil service, the application of the duty under Constitutional Reform Act 2010 to recruit on merit. He argued that the decision in Kennedy should not be followed in the light of Magyar and that s23(1) and s24(1) were incompatible with his rights under Article 10. He argued that the exemptions contained in those sections denied him of information unlawfully. Consideration 23. In support of his challenge to the application of S40 to the material the Appellant pointed to the material voluntarily put into the public domain by some of the successful applications to the fast-stream. Analytically this is not helpful to his case. While some individuals have put such material into the public domain others have not and there is no indication that they would consent to such publication. On the contrary they have been given assurances that personal data will not be revealed. The publication of information in an “amalgamated form” does not, as the Appellant implied, mean that the information as personal data has been published. The tribunal is satisfied that, given the small number of some of the groups identified within the data, the publication of the data sought would mean individual applicants could be identified from it, as could their parents, together with information about the parents which could include the fact that a parent was unemployed. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the material falls within s40 as personal data. 24. For the sake of completeness, the tribunal has considered whether Schedule 2 Condition 6 could have any application to considering whether the release ofthe information would be fair and lawful under the first data protection principle. This provides: - “6. — (1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 25. The Appellant’s legitimate interest is his desire to publish material on what he considers to be the failure of the Fast Stream recruitment process to recruit fairly from all parts of British society but rather to recruit disproportionately from graduates from a small number of universities with privileged family backgrounds. The difficulty however is that the Civil Service itself publishes a mass of quantitative data which demonstrates this as well as publishing its developing plans to redress the balance. The tiny increment of information which he seeking is not necessary to enable him to comment on this situation. 26. The Appellant relied heavily on the ECHR case of Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary in support of his argument that he had an article 10 right to the information requested. In that case a long-established human rights organisation sought information as to the appointment of public defenders, who in Hungary are appointed by the relevant local police force. The relationship between the defender and the prosecuting authority and the possibility of lack of independence of the public defender clearly raise issues as to an accused’s access to a fair trial. The information requested was denied on the basis that it was personal data of the public defenders and under the relevant Hungarian legislation “the respondent police departments cannot be obliged to surrender such personal data.” (Magyar paragraph 30). 27. In resisting the appeal by the Commissioner and Cabinet Office argued that the previously decided Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v Charity Commission had settled that Article 10 did not give a free-standing right of access to information held by public bodies. While in this case there was an absolute exemption from disclosure of the specific information sought under s32(2) other statutory or common law rights to information continued to exist side by side with the FOIA rights since s78 FOIA provided “Nothing in this Act is to be taken to limit the powers of a public authority to disclose information held by it.” There was therefore another route, an alternative remedy to FOIA through which individuals could obtain the information. 28. The First Section of ECHR in Times Newspapers Limited and Kennedy v UK considered the appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court in Kennedy acknowledged the existence of the alternative route to FOIA and stated (paragraph 82):- “Although the applicants have focussed their complaints on the Article 10 compliance of the “absolute exemption” under s32(2) of FOIA, in examining the complaints theCourt will have regard to the domestic legal framework as a whole and not simply the FOIA. While the Court has now recognised that Article 10 of the Convention might, under certain conditions, include a right to access to information (see Magyar..) it does not include a right of access to information by a particular legislative scheme. What matters, is whether the legislative framework as a whole satisfies the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, read in light of the Court’s most recent jurisprudence.” 29. If indeed the Appellant is correct in his interpretation of the impact of the decision in Magyar then for him to be entitled to receive the information the failure to disclose the information must breach Article 10: - 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary 30. Magyar identified four criteria which must be met. These were helpfully summarised by the tribunal in Moss: - • Purpose of request. As a prerequisite, the purpose of the request must be to enable [the requester’s] exercise of the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas to others. The information must be “necessary” for the exercise of freedom of expression; • Nature of information sought. The information must meet a legitimate public interest test to prompt a need for disclosure under the Convention. • Role of requester. The applicant must be in a privileged position, seeking the information with a view to informing the public in the capacity of a public watchdog. Such a privileged position should not be considered to constitute exclusive access. • Information ready and available. Weight should be given to the fact that the information requested is ready and available. 31. Where the right is protected by Article 10(1) Article 10(2) provides the framework for restrictions which are – are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security…32. The combination of s23(1) and 24(1) is such a restriction prescribed by law. The necessity to protect national security in a democratic society is, under FOIA weighed under S2(2) which provides: - (2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— …. (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 33. In the light of the evidence it has heard and seen the tribunal has accepted that the exemption identified by the Cabinet Office as S23(1)/S24(1) applied. This means that, since S24(1) is a qualified privilege, a balancing exercise needs to be applied; weighing the public interest in disclosure (most relevantly the Appellant’s desire to publish discussed in paragraph 25 above) with the public interest in protecting national security. As discussed above; the interest in publication given the plethora of information provided by the Cabinet Office on the Fast Stream that interest is minimal. Due regard must be paid to the risk of harm to national security which greatly outweighs any interest in disclosure. 34. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that, if indeed an article 10 right is engaged, the balancing exercise produces no difference in result from that under FOIA. 35. The tribunal is satisfied that the Commissioner’s decision is correct in law and dismisses the appeal. Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 23/01/2019"
"12","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0084 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Ms Marion Saunders Mr David Wilkinson Determined, by consent, on written evidence and submissions Between Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service Appellant -and- The Information Commissioner Respondent DECISION AND REASONS The request, the response and the Decision Notice 1. On 27 July 2017, the complainant requested information from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service (the Appellant) relating to a hydraulic 1fracturing operation (also known as fracking). The request is in eight paragraphs and is set out in full in the relevant decision notice number FER0703559 dated 5 April 2018 as follows:- “…please respond to the following requests in relation to the Cuadrilla site at Preston New Road. 1) Did operators consult with you at the planning application stages / pre-planning stage, or at any time since on the following emergency response rescue methods; a) casualty handling; b) decontamination zones; c) any special equipment required; d) emergency procedures discussed and agreed between all parties; e) water requirements for fire fighting. Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 2) Have any joint incident-response training exercises been discussed or taken place between operators, yourselves, United Utilities and other emergency responders? If so, who pays / has paid for this? Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 3) At the planning application stage or pre-planning stage, were the following points presented to you for consultation; a) alarm systems for fire warning and fire detection; b) alarm systems for blow-outs; c) hydrogen sulphide (or other toxic gas) alarm systems; d) alarm systems which are directly linked to emergency response centres; e) emergency lighting systems and generators. Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 4) Are any of the points in item 3 regularly checked by you at the site? If so, how regularly? b) What role, if any, do you / have you had in advising or supporting the HSE or company Fire Officers in 'Process (PSPs)' and 'General Safety Precautions (GSPs)' at this site? Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 25) Have you ever been provided (either at planning stage or the current pre-development stage) with a list of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and / or the chemical CAS numbers of ALL chemicals proposed for use at this site? Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 6) With reference to chemicals listed as 'proprietary' in documents supplied to the Environment Agency, are the MSDS and chemical CAS numbers released to your service or to your knowledge, to the Fire Service through the Premises Risk Management Process? Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 7) During flow-testing stage of a hydraulic fracturing operation, the operator 'perforates' the well at various stages below ground. Has the Fire and Rescue Service been warned in advance that explosives / cords / detonators will be on site as would be required under the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) 2002? Please provide all information that you hold OR confirm that no such consultation has taken place. 8) The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 has defined an emergency as - 'Any event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the UK, the environment of a place in the UK, or war or terrorism which threatens serious damage to the security of the UK.' Please advise when your next review of the necessary emergency procedures for this well site will be, OR confirm that no such review is deemed necessary.” 2. On 22 August 2017, the Appellant declined to confirm or deny whether it held the requested information. The Appellant cited the exemptions provided by various sections of FOIA: sections 24(2) (national security), 31(3) (law enforcement) and 38(2) (health and safety). 33. On 1 October 2017 the complainant contacted the Commissioner. The Commissioner informed the complainant on 15 November 2017 that it appeared likely that the requested information would be environmental information as defined by regulation 2 of the EIR, and that the Appellant should have dealt with the request accordingly under the EIR rather than FOIA. The Appellant was also advised to issue a fresh response to the complainant. However, the Appellant replied to say that, in its view, not all the information requested was within the scope of the EIR, although some of it was. Thus, the Appellant wrote to the complainant on 19 December 2017 and stated that, to the extent that the requests were for environmental information, the FRS refused to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held under regulation 12(5)(a) / 12(6) of the EIR. 4. As a result, the Commissioner’s approach in the decision notice was, first of all, to decide whether all the requests should have been handled under the EIR. The decision notice concluded that they should, and so continued to consider the refusal to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held under regulation 12(5)(a) / 12(6) EIR. The Commissioner concluded that the decision not to confirm or deny was wrongly made by the Appellant, and found that the Appellant was ‘required to write to the complainant with confirmation or denial as to whether the information she requested is held’ (paragraph 24). The Commissioner also stated that ‘In relation to any information that is held, this should either be disclosed to the complainant, or the grounds under the EIR for withholding this information should be set out’ (paragraph 3). 5. In its appeal, the Appellant stated that it appealed only against the decision that all of the requested information was environmental information. It said that it was able to communicate to the complainant whether or not the information was held, but that as it would seek to withhold the information, it was not able to set out the exemptions relied 4upon until it had been determined whether the EIR applied to all the information or not. In her response the Commissioner accepts that it is necessary for the correct regime to be identified by the Tribunal, before the Appellant takes the next steps required by the Commissioner. Legal Framework 6. The relevant part of regulation 2(1) of the EIR defines “environmental information”: “‘environmental information’ has the same meaning as in article 2(1) of the [Parliament and Council] Directive [2003/4/EC of 28 January 2003], namely any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on— (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; (b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) measures (including administrative measures) , such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements…” 7. The relevant legal framework as to what constitutes environmental definition under the EIR has recently been explored by the Court of Appeal in the case of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy v Information Commissioner and another [2017] EWCA Civ 844, [2017] P.T.S.R. 1644 (the DBEIS case). Beatson LJ explained at paragraph 13 that:- 513 Guidance as to the legal principles to be followed in construing and applying the definition of “environmental information” in article 2(1) of the [Parliament and Council] Directive [2003/4/EC of 28 January 2003] and regulation 2(1) of the EIR has been given by decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) and United Kingdom courts… 14 The starting point is that the EIR must be interpreted, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the Directive, which itself gives effect to international obligations arising under the Aarhus Convention. In Fish Legal v Information Comr (Case C-297/12) [2014] QB 521 the CJEU stated: “35. First of all, it should be recalled that, by becoming a party to the Aarhus Convention, the European Union undertook to ensure, within the scope of EU law, a general principle of access to environmental information held by or for public authorities: see Ville de Lyon v Caisse des dépôts et consignations (Case C-524/09) [2010] ECR I-14115 , para 36 and Flachglas Torgau GmbH v Federal Republic of Germany (Case C- 204/09) [2013] QB 212 , para 30. “36. As recital (5) in the Preamble to Directive 2003/4 confirms, in adopting that Directive the EU legislature intended to ensure the consistency of EU law with the Aarhus Convention with a view to its conclusion by the Community, by providing for a general scheme to ensure that any natural or legal person in a member state has a right of access to environmental information held by or on behalf of public authorities, without that person having to state an interest: see the Flachglas Torgau case, para 31. “37. It follows that, for the purposes of interpreting Directive 2003/4 , account is to be taken of the wording and aim of the Aarhus Convention, which that Directive is designed to implement in EU law: see the Flachglas Torgau case, para 40.” 15 The importance of the obligation to provide access to environmental information is seen from the recitals to the Directive and the Aarhus Convention. The first recital to the Directive states: “Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of views, more effective participation by the public in 6environmental decision-making and, eventually, to a better environment.” The recitals to the Aarhus Convention include: “citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters …” And: “improved access to information and public participation in decision-making enhance the quality and the implementation of decisions, contribute to public awareness of environmental issues, give the public the opportunity to express its concerns and enable public authorities to take due account of such concerns.” 8. Beatson LJ went on to explain that:- 16 It is well established that the term “environmental information” in the Directive is to be given a broad meaning and that the intention of the Community's legislature was to avoid giving that concept a definition which could have had the effect of excluding from the scope of that Directive any of the activities engaged in by the public authorities: see Glawischnig v Bundesminister für soziale Sicherheit und Generationen (Case C-316/01) EU:C:2003:343 , para 24. That decision concerned Directive 90/313/EEC but it was common ground that the same approach applies to Directive 2003/4/EC , which replaced it, and with which this case is concerned. That a broad meaning is to be given to the term is also seen from the decisions of this court in Venn v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2015] 1 WLR 2328 , paras 10–12, per Sullivan LJ (referring to the decision of the CJEU in Lesoochranárske zoskupenie VLK v Ministerstvo životného prostredia Slovenskej republiky (Case C-240/09) [2012] PTSR 822; [2012] QB 606 ) and in Austin v Miller Argent (South Wales) Ltd [2015] 1 WLR 62 , paras 17 and 30, per Elias and Pitchford LJJ. 17 The Glawischnig and Fish Legal cases, however, also show the limits of the broad approach. In the Glawischnig case it was stated, at para 25, that the fact that the Directive is to be given a broad meaning does not mean that it intended: “to give a general and unlimited right of access to all information held by public authorities which has a connection, however minimal, with one of the 7environmental factors mentioned … To be covered by the right of access it establishes, such information must fall within one or more of the … categories set out in that provision.” 9. At paragraph 37 Beatson LJ explains the somewhat different approaches to what constitutes information, in FOIA and in the EIR: 37 There is an important difference between the definition of “information” in section 1(1) of the FOIA and the definition of “environmental information” in section 2(1)(c) of the EIR . The former focuses on the information itself: see Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority v Information Comr [2015] 1 WLR 2879 , paras 35–36. The latter also focuses on the relevant measure rather than solely on the nature of the information itself. It refers to “any information” “on … (c) measures … affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to” in regulation 2(1)(a) and (b) ” (emphasis added). It is therefore first necessary to identify the relevant measure. Information is “on” a measure if it is about, relates to or concerns the measure in question. 10. Thus, it seems to us that the information requested in this case will come within the FOIA definition of that word: the question is to what extent it also comes within the definition of environmental information in reg 2(1)(c) EIR as well. To answer that question it is necessary to for us to identify the measure and then decide whether the information is ‘on’ the measure, that is whether it is about, relates to or concerns that measure. 11. It is also important to note as Beatson LJ did in BDEIS at paragraph 39 that:- …the tribunal is not restricted by what the information is specifically, directly or immediately about. In my judgment, this is consistent with the language used in regulation 2(1)(c) . Nothing in that language requires the relevant measure to be that which the information is “primarily” on. … 42 Furthermore, … it is possible for information to be “on” more than one measure. … Nothing in the EIR suggests that an artificially restrictive approach should be taken to regulation 2(1) or that there is 8only a single answer to the question “what measure or activity is the requested information about?” Understood in its proper context, information may correctly be characterised as being about a specific measure, about more than one measure, or about both a measure which is a sub-component of a broader measure and the broader measure as a whole… 12. This wide description as to whether information is on a ‘measure’ also appears to have an impact as to how the ‘measure’ itself is defined. The Court of Appeal said at paragraph 43 of the DBEIS case that:- 43 It follows that identifying the measure that the disputed information is “on” may require consideration of the wider context, and is not strictly limited to the precise issue with which the information is concerned…It may be relevant to consider the purpose for which the information was produced, how important the information is to that purpose, how it is to be used, and whether access to it would enable the public to be informed about, or to participate in, decision-making in a better way. None of these matters may be apparent on the face of the information itself. It was not in dispute that, when identifying the measure, a tribunal should apply the definition in the EIR purposively, bearing in mind the modern approach to the interpretation of legislation, and particularly to international and European measures such as the Aarhus Convention and the Directive. It is then necessary to consider whether the measure so identified has the requisite environmental impact for the purposes of regulation 2(1) . 13. The Court explained also that there was a limit to what could be environmental information when it stated that:- e) The role of a purposive interpretation in this context: 45 A literal reading of regulation 2(1)(c) would mean that any information about a relevant “measure” would be environmental information, even if the information itself could not be characterised as having, even potentially, an environmental impact as defined. However, as recognised by the judge, at para 91, “simply because a project has some environmental impact”, it does not follow that “all information concerned with that project must necessarily be environmental information”. Interpreting the provision in that way would be inconsistent with the decision in the Glawischnig case EU:C:2003:343 discussed at paras 16–17 above. Since that case also stated that the Directive is to be given a broad meaning, I have concluded that the statutory definition in regulation 2(1)(c) does not mean that the information itself must be intrinsically environmental. 946 The question is how to draw the line between information that qualifies and information that does not….. 47 In my judgment, the way the line will be drawn is by reference to the general principle that the Regulations, the Directive, and the Aarhus Convention are to be construed purposively. Determining on which side of the line information falls will be fact and context-specific. But it is possible to provide some general guidance as to the circumstances in which information relating to a project will not be information “on” the project for the purposes of section 2(1)(c) because it is not consistent with or does not advance the purpose of those instruments. Discussion and decision 14. The Commissioner’s decision notice deals with the issue as follows:- 13. The information requests above all concern the Cuadrilla site at Preston New Road, Lancashire. This is a hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, site. The Preston New Road operation is an activity which is likely to affect many of the elements and factors referred to in regulations 2(1)(a) and (b). For example, its construction and operation is likely to affect land and landscape, and will be likely to result in environmental factors such as energy and emissions. 14. The reasoning of the [Appellant] was that, whilst for some of the requests any in-scope information would be environmental, for others any relevant information would not have the fracking operation as its main focus. Information within the scope of request 3(e) for instance would have as its focus emergency lighting, rather than the fracking operation. Whilst [the Appellant] accepted that information directly about the Preston New Road operation would be environmental, in essence its argument was that for some of the requests any information within their scope would be too far removed from the fracking operation itself to qualify as environmental. 15. For information to be environmental according to regulation 2(1), it must be “on” one of the definitions listed in that regulation. The Commissioner’s guidance on identifying environmental information states that the EIR should be interpreted broadly when considering whether information is “on” a matter and that the 10question a public authority should consider is whether information is on or about something that would be covered by the definition in regulation 2, rather than whether the information is about the environment directly. 16. The Commissioner agrees with [the Appellant] that for some of the requests any information falling within their scope may not immediately appear to be environmental. However, applying the approach described in her guidance, the Commissioner’s view is that any information falling within the scope of the requests would clearly still be “on” the Preston New Road operation, which is an activity likely to affect elements and factors listed in regulations 2(1)(a) and (b). That information would, therefore, be environmental in accordance with the definition given in regulation 2(1)(c). 17. As a result, the Commissioner finds that the requests should have been in their entirety handled under the EIR. 15. The Appellant’s appeal makes a number of points in response. These can be summarised as follows:- (a) The fracking operation has a much wider effect than affecting the environment, and this can include (i) local policing capacity and priorities; (ii) journey times; and (iii) employment. Questions ‘on’ the site ‘cannot simply be designated as environmental’. (b) If the request for example in 3(e) about emergency lighting systems and generators had been made in isolation, ‘it is extremely difficult to envisage how this could be designated as environmental information’. (c) ‘[I]nformation about the site relates to a much wider scope than simply environmental considerations’. An example is given which is information concerning ‘a multi-agency meeting to do with the site’ which covers a wide range of factors including, as the Commissioner notes in her Response ‘a road traffic accident on the M55’. 11(d) The argument is made that ‘all factors, measures and any other consequences must be linked to an affect on the elements of the environment in order to come with the terms of reference’ of regulation 2(1) EIR. The information should ‘be seen as affecting the environment’, before the EIR applies 16. Applying the approach in the DBEIS case we agree with the Commissioner that all the information sought is environmental information. 17. For the purposes of Reg 2(1)(c) EIR the ‘measure’ in question what the Commissioner calls the ‘the Preston New Road operation’: an ‘activity’ which is likely to affect many of the elements and factors referred to in regulations 2(1)(a) and (b) EIR. 18. All the information sought is ‘on’ this activity, in that it is ‘about, relates to or concerns the measure in question’. This is the case even if, as the Appellant argues, some of the information would not have the fracking operation as its main focus. That does not matter, for the reasons set out in paragraph 42 of the DBEIS case: the information can be ‘about a specific measure, about more than one measure, or about both a measure which is a sub-component of a broader measure and the broader measure as a whole’. All the information which is the subject matter of these requests will come within that definition. In particular, as the Commissioner argues in her Response to the appeal ‘the scope of the information requested in this particular case concerns essentially on broad issue, namely the issue of safety on the site’. 19. In our view the information in request 3(e), about the presentation to the Appellant about emergency lighting systems at the site (about which the 12Appellant makes specific submissions (see above)), even when taken in isolation, is clearly ‘on’ the measure of the Preston New Road ‘activity’. Likewise, it seems to us that information about a ‘multi-agency meeting to do with the site’ must also be ‘on’ the activity. This would include matters such as the road accident referred to which, as the Commissioner notes in her Response ‘came under the heading ‘Disruption Tactics’ which related to disruption to traffic caused by protestors on site’. 20. Taking the Appellant’s point summarised in paragraph 15 (d) above, the Appellant appears to misunderstand the proper interpretation of regulation 2(1) EIR. It is not a question, as the Appellant claims, of establishing that the information should ‘be seen as affecting the environment’, before the EIR applies. As set out above the question is whether there is a ‘measure’ (for example an activity such as the fracking site operation) ‘affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b)’ of regulation 2(1) EIR. The Appellant does not seem to argue that the fracking site operation is not such a measure. “Environmental information” is then defined as information which is ‘on’ that measure (the fracking site operation) as that is defined in the case law set out above. We note that Beatson LJ at paragraph 45 of the DBEIS case said that ‘the statutory definition in regulation 2(1)(c) does not mean that the information itself must be intrinsically environmental’. 21. In further considering which side of the line the information falls, we note the need to consider the recitals to the Directive and the Aarhus Convention and whether the requested information is consistent with or advances the purpose of those instruments. As set out above the first recital to the Directive states: “Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of views, 13more effective participation by the public in environmental decision-making and, eventually, to a better environment.” 22. The recitals to the Aarhus Convention include: “citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters …” And: “improved access to information and public participation in decision-making enhance the quality and the implementation of decisions, contribute to public awareness of environmental issues, give the public the opportunity to express its concerns and enable public authorities to take due account of such concerns.” 23. It seems to us that the requested information, if disclosed, would advance the purposes of these instruments in that the public would have fuller knowledge of the matters raised in the request and be better able to express concerns and participate in the decision-making process. 24. We have been provided with a bundle of material which the Appellant has submitted as relevant to the request. Some of the material post-dates the request on 27 July 2017 and so we have not considered that at all as it outside the scope of the request. Of the other material, the Appellant helpfully accepts that very much of it is ‘information’ for the purposes of FOIA, as well as ‘environmental information’ for the purposes of the EIR (which of course is perfectly possible). In fact, it appears that the disputed information now amounts only to a number of emails which, in our view, are clearly ‘on’ the measure in question and which would advance the purposes of the instruments described above. Conclusion 25. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that all the information sought by the requester in this case is ‘environmental information’ and the 14appeal is therefore dismissed, and the Appellant will need to deal with the request on that basis. 26.

"13","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0110 Heard at Wigan County Court On 14 June 2018 Representation: Appellant: in person First Respondent: The Information Commissioner did not appear Second Respondent (Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group): Mrs Harvey Smith (Counsel) Before JUDGE BUCKLEY MALCOLM CLARKE AND PAUL TAYLOR Between MARTIN L ADEDEJI Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and WIGAN BOROUGH CLINICAL COMMISSIONING GROUP Second Respondent DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the Tribunal allows the appeal and issues the following substitute decision notice. 1SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group Complainant: Martin Adedeji The Substitute Decision 1. For the reasons set out below the Public Authority was not entitled to refuse the Complainant’s requests for information made on 2 August 2016 and 5 September 2016 on the grounds that they were vexatious. Action Required 2. Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group is required to respond to Mr Adedeji’s requests within 35 days of the promulgation of this judgment either by supplying the information or by serving a refusal notice under s 17, indicating what grounds they rely on other than s 14(1). REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50659774 and FS50661772 of 25 April 2017 which held that Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group (‘the CCG’) had correctly applied s 14(1) of FOIA, and that the CCG had complied with s 16(1). The Commissioner did not require the public authority to take any steps. This is a majority decision. Procedural issues 2. The CCG drew to our attention that Mr Collins from the CCG had been an audit manager providing external audit services to the board of Trafford PCT when Malcolm Clarke had been a non-executive director on the board. Mr Collins therefore remembered Dr Clarke because he had attended board audit committee meetings. This was more than five years ago and the relationship, of which Dr Clarke only had limited recollection, was restricted to formal meetings. Neither party had any objection to Dr Clarke remaining on the Tribunal, and the Tribunal saw no reason why Dr Clarke should recuse himself. Observations outside the scope of this appeal 3. Since 2013 Mr Adedeji has attempted to make various complaints and requests for information or personal data, which he would, before their abolition in 2013 have made to the Ashton Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust (‘the PCT’). In the absence of the PCT he has approached the Department of Health, Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group (‘the CCG’) and NHS England. They have all referred him to each other (see table in Annex One prepared by the Tribunal). It should not be any more difficult for an individual to make a complaint or a request for information/data to the PCT than it would be if they still existed. 4. As a result of the responses from these bodies, Mr Adedeji attempted to use FOIA to find out who holds personal data relating to his complaint to the PCT in 2010 and who is the appropriate body to whom he should complain about the PCT’s actions. 25. The Department of Health (see appeal number EA/2017/0137) has now sent Mr Adedeji a list of all the different organisations who have inherited all the different functions of the PCT. It does not however solve his problem. The identity of the appropriate body is still not clear to Mr Adedeji from this list. It is not clear to the Tribunal. 6. It is not Mr Adedeji’s fault that PCTs have been abolished. Nor is it his fault that their functions and records have been dispersed to different bodies. It is extremely difficult for a lay person to identify the appropriate body that holds the relevant data and that will deal with the relevant complaints. 7. It appears from correspondence disclosed by the CCG in response to the Tribunal’s decision in EA/2017/0049 that there is agreement between the different bodies that NHS England holds the personal data relating to the 2010 complaint. 8. It falls outside the scope of this appeal, but it is likely to save a lot of time if the Department of Health, the CCG and NHS England could agree a joint letter to Mr Adedeji identifying (a) the organisation which holds the data relating to his 2010 complaints to the PCT, including contact details and, if possible, a named individual contact and (b) the organisation, by name, that is prepared to deal with each of his substantive complaints including contact details and, if possible, a named individual contact. Evidence and submissions 9. We have read and were referred to several bundles of documents: 1. The bundle and ‘documents referred to in the timeline at p94 of the bundle’(paginated sequentially from p1-357). 2. Additional open documents (not paginated). 3. Appellant’s supporting documents (paginated from p1A-336A). 10. We also read written submissions from the CCG and the Commissioner’s response and heard oral argument from the CCG and Mr Adedeji. 11. There is some overlap between this appeal and appeal EA/2017/0137 which this Tribunal heard on the same day. During the hearing the Tribunal provided a number of relevant additional documents from the EA/2017/0137 bundle to the CCG. Mr Adedeji had seen those documents already. The CCG’s representative had the opportunity to read those documents and take instructions. She did not object to their inclusion. They were: 1. A letter dated 20 April 2016 from the Department of Health to Mr Adedeji (p99- 101 of the EA/2017/90137 bundle, ‘the DoH bundle’). 2. Certain pages from a table produced by the Department of Health reproducing the content of letters from the Department of Health to Mr Adedeji between 2013 and 2016 (pp130, 132, 141, 142 and 144). Factual background to the appeal 12. On 3 August 2009 Mr Adedeji attended a consultation with his GP at Dicconson Group Practice. On 29 January 2010 he made a complaint about the GP’s conduct in that consultation to Ashton Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust (‘the PCT’). By letter dated 3 February 2010 he opted to have the complaint investigated by the PALS and Complaints Department at the PCT (p18A). In October 2012 Mr Adedeji complained to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Mr Adedeji remains unhappy with 3the way the complaint was handled, both by the PCT and the Ombudsman. He also made another complaint about a different GP at Dicconson Group in 2010. 13. The PCT ceased to exist on 1 April 2013 and the Wigan Borough Clinical Commissioning Group (the CCG) was created. The extent to which it was the successor to the PCT or took over its functions is not clear. 14. Mr Adedeji has wished to raise, since 2013, a number of complaints, which he would have raised with the PCT if it still existed. He also wishes to obtain the data which was held by the PCT in relation to the complaints he made in 2010. 15. He has approached a number of different organisations: the CCG, the Department of Health and NHS England. The information he has been given about who now has the data and who will deal with a complaint about the PCT has been inconsistent. The Tribunal has created a table of the information he has been given which is attached at Annex One. 16. On 18 July 2016 Mr Adedeji made a request to the CCG, for: Information … which states who is the data controller for the personal data processed by Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust (ALWPCT) during their handling of service user’s complaints made to ALWPCT from the 01st April 2009. 17. In its response the CCG explained that it did not hold information prior to April 2013 and that NHS England holds all legacy information. Mr Adedeji referred the matter to the Commissioner who decided that the CCG did not hold the information. Mr Adedeji appealed and the first tier tribunal in a decision dated 7 August 2017 (EA/2017/0049) decided that the CCG did hold the information and ordered that the CCG supply Mr Adedeji with copies of any relevant documents by 1 September 2017. 18. In response to the Tribunal decision in EA/2017/0049 further documents were sent to Mr Adedeji. These included a letter dated 26 July 2013 from the Legacy Management Team at the Department of Health. The relevant part states: Legacy claims and complaints: All the legacy claim files received from the PCTs have now been transferred to xxxxxxxxxxxxx, .. It is expected that these files will then be transferred in September to the appropriate Receiving Organisations – NHS England, Department of Health, Property Services. 19. Also in response to that decision the CCG disclosed a chain of emails dated 8 August 2017 between Tim Collins (CCG), the Department of Health and NHS England. The relevant part of the email from the Department of Health states: When the PCT dissolved responsibilities transferred to various organisation depending on the function. You are right in what you state that PCT complaints which relate to a patient were taken on by NHS England. More general complaints now come under the control of DH Legacy Records Team mb_legacy_records@dh.gsi.gov.uk 20. Attached to that email was a redacted internal Department of Health letter of 26 July 2013 purporting to explain the arrangements. The combination of the use of professional language and acronyms and the redactions makes the implications of this letter difficult to understand for a lay person and indeed the Tribunal. 421. The relevant part of the email from NHS England states: NHS England is the data controller for patient complaints for the former PCTs… more general complaints go to the Department of Health. 22. A further email from NHS England in response to an email from the CCG asking for contact details to give to Mr Adedeji stated: I think it would be a good idea to give the appellant the Information Governance email inbox as any information governance queries should go there in the first instance. Someone would definitely get back to him/her. The email address is england.ig-corporate@nhs.net Requests, Decision Notice and appeal 23. This appeal concerns two requests. The August request – 2 August 2016 24. Mr Adedeji made the August request under FOIA on 2 August 2016: 1. What recorded information do you hold which states what personal data processed from the 01st April 2009 by Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust (ALWPCT) during their handling of service users complaints you hold. 2. What recorded information do you hold which states what personal data processed from the 01st April 2009 by ALWPCT during their handling of service user’s complaints have you shared with other organisations since April 2013. 25. The CCG replied by email on 4 August 2016 Unfortunately, [your FOI request] does not ask for any new information and can be answered by the response which was sent under reference number WIG/FOI/8295: Wigan Borough CCG does not hold information prior to its inception in April 2013. NHS England holds all legacy information. To contact NHS England please use this link: http://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/foi/. ‘Legacy information’ means information relating to a previous organisation that no longer exists. Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust is a previous organisation that no longer exists. All legacy information is held by NHS England, as indicated previously on multiple occasions, and therefore NHS England holds all the information relating to Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust. … Please note that we have now responded to your request on numerous occasions and provided you with the information you requested, and as such will no longer respond to any requests for information relating to Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust under section 14(1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. All further requests for information relating to Ashton, Leigh and Wigan Primary Care Trust should be directed to NHS England, which is the data controller. 26. Mr Adedeji requested an internal review on 7 August 2016. The CCG refused to carry out an internal review because: 51. Wigan Borough CCG has already provided you with the information. 2. Wigan Borough CCG cannot answer questions on behalf of another organisation. All of ALWPCT’s information was transferred to NHS England. You have already had an internal review for your last request, the result of which was that the CCG confirmed that the data controller for ALWPCT was NHS England and not Wigan Borough CCG. 27. Mr Adedeji referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 6 October 2016. The September request – 5 September 2016 28. Mr Adedeji made the September request on 5 September 2016: I am requesting a copy of all recorded information you hold regarding allegations that any of the General Practitioner’s at the Dicconson Group Practice racially abused a patient. 29. The CCG replied on 8 September 2016 indicating that it did not consider the request to be a FOI request because it was a request for personal data, and that any subject access request would need to be made to the practice itself or to NHS England as primary care commissioners and that: It is highly unlikely that the CCG will hold much, if any, information relating to this incident…as there is nothing further that the Department can add, we must now consider this matter to be closed. Unless you raise a new question, any further letters sent to the Department will be logged but you may not receive a reply. 30. Mr Adedeji emailed the CCG on 9 September 2016 asking the CCG to process it as a FOI request or providing advice and assistance as to how it could be re-phrased as a FOI request. 31. The CCG replied on 14 September 2016 stating that they now considered his requests to be unreasonable and persistent and therefore there would not be any further response to similar requests. 32. Mr Adedeji referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 4 January 2017. 33. In a decision notice dated 25 April 2017 the Commissioner decided: 1. The two requests are vexatious and the CCG is not obliged to comply with them under section 14(1) of the FOIA. 2. The CCG provided adequate advice and assistance and complied with its obligation under s 16(1). 3. The CCG’s refusal of request 2 breached section 17(5). 34. Mr Adedeji appealed against the Commissioner’s decision notice. The notice of appeal challenges the Commissioner’s decision notice on the grounds that: 1. The requests were not vexatious. 2. The CCG did not provide adequate advice and assistance under s 16(1). Issues 635. The issues we have to determine are: 1. Did the Commissioner err in finding that the CCG was entitled to rely on s 14(1) – vexatious request? 2. Did the Commissioner err in finding that the CCG had not breached s 16(1)? Legal framework S 14(1) Vexatious Request 36. Guidance on applying s 14 is given in the decisions of the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in Dransfield ([2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and [2015] EWCA Civ 454). The Tribunal should take into account all the circumstances, in particular the motive of the requester, the value or serious purpose of the request, the burden imposed by the request and the harassment or distress to staff and consider whether the request is a ‘manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure’ and is therefore vexatious. 37. The Upper Tribunal said, at para 29: ‘The context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious.’ 38. The Tribunal considers the four factors identified by the Upper Tribunal to be a helpful framework to structure its consideration of whether the request was vexatious but has had regard to the fact that it is not intended to be an exhaustive definition or a checklist for determination of this issue. 39. The factors above are considered in the context that the Court of Appeal held that “vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public”. Section 16 – Advice and Assistance 40. Section 16 provides: (1) It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it. The role of the Tribunal 41. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether he should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Discussion and conclusions S 14 - vexatious request 742. The Commissioner decided that the August request was vexatious because the CCG has informed Mr Adedeji on more than one occasion prior to the submission of his August request that it does not hold any information concerning the PCT because it is not the successor to the PCT. Mr Adedeji was therefore aware when he submitted the request that the CCG was not the successor organisation to the PCT. 43. In relation to the September request the Commissioner found that it was vexatious on the basis that Mr Adedeji’s requests to the CCG are an attempt to use the FOIA to keep open matters that appear to have been dealt with, to Mr Adedeji’s dissatisfaction, some time ago. Considered cumulatively with the August request and the earlier contacts set out in the timeline provided by the CCG, the September request was vexatious because the requests are placing an unjustified burden on the CCG. 44. The Commissioner referred in the decision notice to her decision in FS50642904. The appeal against that decision has been upheld by the first tier tribunal EA/2016/0049 as outlined above. 45. The Commissioner’s response to the Notice of Appeal makes the following additional points: 1. Mr Adedeji’s argument that emails from other organisations demonstrate that NHS England is not the data controller for data processed by the PCT concerning complaints received from 2009 reflects Mr Adedeji’s mistrust of the CCG despite NHS England agreeing it is the successor to the PCT. 2. Mr Adedeji is likely to continue to seek to engage the CCG in correspondence and divert its resources in an attempt to revisit matters arising from his complaint to the PCT despite the Ombudsman’s substantive decision about his 2010 complaint and the Commissioner’s decision that the CCG do not hold information relating to the PCT (overturned by appeal EA/2017/0049). 3. It is not clear to the Commissioner how disclosure of the information would benefit the public. 4. The contacts and requests taken as a whole are an inappropriate use of FOIA as per Dransfield UT. 5. If the Tribunal finds that the requests have a serious purpose and that FOIA is an appropriate means, this is outweighed by the serious burden on the CCG in dealing with the requests and associated correspondence. 46. There are two issues relied on in the Decision Notice to support the finding that the requests were vexatious. Firstly, in relation to the August request, that Mr Adedeji had been told by CCG that NHS England and not the CCG was the appropriate body to whom he should make the FOI request several times before he made the August request. Secondly that the September request was vexatious in the light of the past history of correspondence and requests between the CCG and Mr Adedeji. 47. In relation to the first issue, we find that it was not clear to Mr Adedeji at the time that he made the request that NHS England were the appropriate body. Attached at Annex A is a table the Tribunal has collated showing the information he has been given by the CCG, NHS England and the Ombudsman as to the identity of the appropriate body. 48. The table shows that in April 2016 Mr Adedeji was told by NHS England to contact the Department of Health. It shows that the Department of Health has consistently told Mr Adedeji that the CCG is the successor organisation to the PCT and that he should contact the CCG, including on 14 April 2016, 1 June 2016 and 7 July 2016. 849. Further the only ‘official document’ (as opposed to correspondence) which the claimant had seen at the time of the request which indicated who had inherited complaints data from the PCTs is the extract disclosed by the Department of Health (p53) and this document states that the nominated transferee was the CCG. In its submission the CCG states (para 12d) that the CCG has been trying to identify a complete copy of this document to properly consider it. The Tribunal observes that the fact that the CCG is unable to identify such a document suggests that even amongst the relevant bodies there was not a clear grasp of the respective organisational responsibilities after PCTs were abolished. 50. In the absence of a consistent response from the Department of Health, the CCG and NHS England and in particular in the light of the Department of Health’s consistent redirection to the CCG we find that it was not vexatious to continue to ask the CCG for the information even though they had told him that they did not hold it. 51. We note that there appears now to be some agreement between the three organisations that NHS England is the appropriate body to deal with Mr Adedeji’s request as evidenced by the emails disclosed in response to the tribunal appeal EA/2017/0049. There might be good reasons why a complaint cannot be dealt with, but confusion over the right body to deal with the complaint is not one of those reasons. As we indicate in observations above, it would assist Mr Adedeji and might reduce future correspondence if the three bodies could write an agreed letter to Mr Adedeji indicating which body was prepared to deal with his particular complaint/request. 52. In relation to the second issue, the Commissioner concluded that the September request was vexatious when considered cumulatively with the August request and four years of earlier contacts. The Commissioner took account of the CCG’s submission, its timeline of contacts and her investigation of other complaints by Mr Adedeji about associated authorities’ handling of requests on similar subjects. She concluded that the requests were an attempt to use FOIA to keep open matters that were dealt with to Mr Adedeji’s dissatisfaction some time ago, namely the 2010 complaint about Dicconson Group Practice. 53. In relation to the factual background relied on by the Commissioner, the Tribunal notes that the Commissioner did not see the correspondence referred to in the timeline. It does not all relate to the same 2010 complaint. There is, for example, reference to a complaint about a different GP. Further, as acknowledged in the Commissioner’s submission the contacts cover three not four years. 54. We find that the requests are not vexatious. Our starting point is that, in making an information request, Mr Adedeji was exercising an important statutory right and that the hurdle of satisfying section 14(1) is a high one. 55. Although these particular requests looked at individually do not place a significant burden on the CCG we accept that dealing with correspondence from Mr Adedeji has placed a significant burden on the CCG, and we accept their estimate of at least 70 hours of work. 56. The timeline bundle shows that Mr Adedeji was pursuing a number of related complaints, which he would have raised with the PCT if it had remained in existence. In September 2013 Mr Adedeji began to attempt to raise these complaints with what he had been told was the appropriate body, the CCG. At no point does the CCG deal substantively with any of these complaints, because they do not accept that they are the appropriate body to deal with them. It is not the case therefore, that Mr Adedeji is constantly trying to re- open complaints that the CCG have dealt with already. We have found, above, that it 9was not unreasonable for Mr Adedeji to continue to raise these matters with the CCG in the light of the consistent response from the Department of Health that the CCG was the appropriate body to contact. 57. Mr Adedeji does raise a number of new complaints post September 2013. Some of them arise out of information he became aware of more recently (for example see p213). One of them (for example p170) does appear to be attempting to reopen the 2010 complaint. Some of them relate to a dispute over whether or not one of the complaints was in time. 58. As well as these complaints, Mr Adedeji made a number of FOI and/or subject access requests to CCG for personal data related to complaints against the PCT. In the light of the inconsistent information (set out in the table in Annex One) that Mr Adedeji was receiving about who had inherited the data from the PCT, and in the light of the fact that Mr Adedeji had seen correspondence from the CCG providing some of this data to others (e.g. p335, 336) it was not unreasonable for Mr Adedeji to think that they might hold it. 59. It is apparent from the documents in the time line bundle that a large proportion of the correspondence between Mr Adedeji and the CCG was caused by the lack of clarity and consistency from the various public bodies as to the identity of the appropriate body to deal with his complaints and requests. The motive and purpose behind this portion of the correspondence was entirely legitimate. Mr Adedeji was attempting to find out (a) who held his personal data in relation to his 2010 complaints and (b) where he should make a complaint now the PCT had been abolished. This information is clearly of value to Mr Adedeji, and although the likely number of complaints about action by PCTs will diminish as time goes on, we find that it is also of value to the public for there to be a clear answer as to who has become accountable for the actions of PCTs and who now holds personal data held by PCTs. 60. The Tribunal finds that a smaller proportion of the correspondence does, on the balance of probabilities, arise from Mr Adedeji seeking to reopen matters that have already been investigated by other bodies to his dissatisfaction, but finds that this element does not represent an unreasonable burden. 61. There is no evidence and we do not draw an inference that either the requests under consideration or any element of the correspondence arises from a desire by Mr Adedeji to cause any harassment or distress. 62. Looked at as whole we find that the requests are not a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure and the Commissioner erred in concluding that they were vexatious. Minority reasons 63. This is a majority decision. The minority member agreed with the Information Commissioner that the requests were vexatious. His reasons in summary are as follows. 64. During the hearing Mr Adedeji said: ""I am trying to obtain information to overturn the unjust and unfair decision."" He also stated: ""Behind all of this appeal I am looking for all information arising from the incident at Dicconson Group Practice."" He went on to say that: ""The request did relate to my allegations but I was asking for any information held that was not personal data"". 1065. In his notice of appeal (p19) Mr Adedeji states: ""My requests are an attempt to remedy the injustice, maladministration and harm I have suffered in respect of incidents at my former GP's the Dicconson Group Practice (DGP)…"" This was investigated by the Parliamentary Health Services Ombudsman. 66. In the opinion of the minority member Mr Adedeji's own evidence shows that his requests are, as the IC put it (p7, para.37): ""...an attempt to use the FOIA to keep open matters that appear to have been dealt with, to the complainants dissatisfaction, some time ago."" 67. The minority member also found that the information which Mr Adedeji considered to be missing was his personal data, his belief being that he should have been provided this in response to his subject access requests. FOIA is not the correct route to address concerns about an SAR response, instead he should have gone to the IC about this. 68. The minority member agrees with the IC's findings in paras.17-39 (pp4-8). 69. All members of the Tribunal agree that although the appeal has succeeded on this issue, we urge Mr Adedeji to have fair regard for the limited resources of the CCG and the other authorities. The number of requests that Mr Adedeji has made show that he is approaching the line where requests may in the future properly be considered vexatious. We wish to make clear to Mr Adedeji that if the three public authorities concerned follow our recommendation and write a joint letter to Mr Adedeji clearly identifying by name the body who is willing to deal substantively with his complaints/answer his data requests, any further FOI requests to bodies other than the named body run the risk of being considered vexatious. Advice and assistance 70. We find that the Commissioner did not err in concluding that the CCG had offered Mr Adedeji adequate and appropriate advice and assistance, on the basis that the CCG had attempted to redirect Mr Adedeji to the appropriate authority. 71. However, the CCG is now aware of Mr Adedeji’s difficulties in identifying a body to deal with his requests and has more information about what Mr Adedeji has been told by the Department of Health and NHS England. Our view is that in order to comply with this duty in relation to these or any future requests relating to information formerly held by the PCT, the CCG should consider carefully the section 45 Code of Practice, and in particular part III ‘Transferring Requests for Information’. 72. The CCG should also consider carefully the wording of the request. It is clear from the papers (p26, p335A, p336A) that the CCG has, since April 2013, shared personal data processed by the PCT during the handling of service users complaints with at least one other organisation. It seems likely therefore that if anyone holds the information in paragraph 2 of the August request, it is the CCG.

"14","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0291 Decided without a hearing Before CHRIS RYAN JUDGE MICHAEL HAKE DAVE SIVERS TRIBUNAL MEMBERS Between GRAHAM LEGGETT Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONSIN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2016/0291 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This Appeal arises from a Decision Notice published by the Information Commissioner under reference FS50615738 on 10 November 2016 (“the Decision Notice”). The Information Commissioner rejected the Appellant’s complaint about the way in which the Second Respondent (“BBC”) had handled a request for information he had submitted to it on 3 December 2015 (“the Request”). 2. The Request was in the following terms: “As evidenced by the attached document TRUST (13) 39 entitled “The BBC Whistleblowing policy and processes” under the section IV. Annex II Whistleblowing complaints – Dataset”, the following statistics were reported by BBC HR to the BBC Trust. -There was one incident of whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act (“dpa”) in 2012. - There have been two incidences of whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act between 2008 and 2012. - Neither instances of whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act between 2008 and 2012 were ‘Not upheld’ - Both instances of whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act between 2008 and 2012 resulted in “Disciplinary Action but no dismissal”. “From the above it can be concluded that the instance of whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act in 2012 was upheld, and that disciplinary action was taken but no dismissal. “Did the individual who requested the investigation into whistleblowing with respect to the Data Protection Act in 2012 received (sic) notification of the outcome of this investigation by the time the attached report was published? If so on what date did this occur? If not did the individual above receive notification of the outcome of this investigation after the attached report was published? If so, on what date did this occur? [We will refer to this as “First Request”) Did the individual above claim they had suffered any form of detriment, bullying or harassment, and if so was an investigation made into such a claim, and in turn if so, on what date was the individual notified of the outcome [“Second Request”]Has the individual above received any offer of compensation, and if so, on what date was this offer made? [“Third Request”] Was this instance of whistleblowing in 2012 investigated by the Information Commissioner? If so, what was the outcome of the investigation, and was the individual who requested the investigation into whistleblowing notified of this outcome? [“Fourth Request”] 3. Under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), a public authority is obliged to disclose information it holds to anyone requesting it, provided the information is not exempt or other factors override the obligation. The BBC is treated as a public body in the context of this Appeal. 4. The grounds on which the BBC refused to comply with the Request were summarised in the Decision Notice at paragraphs 6-16. The evidential basis for the Information Commissioner’s decision in favour of the BBC, and the reasoning she adopted, are clearly set out in the Decision Notice. The conclusion the Information Commissioner reached was that: “• On the balance of probabilities, the BBC does not hold information that falls within the scope of parts 1 and 4 of the request. •Under section 40(5)(b)(i), the BBC is correct to neither confirm nor deny it holds the information requested under parts 2 and 3 of the request as to do so would release the personal data of a third person.” 5. The BBC had, quite properly, treated the requested information as relating to a third party, even though it suspected that the Appellant was in fact “the individual” referred to in each part of the Request. The Information Commissioner adopted the same approach. However, in the Grounds of Appeal filed in support of the Appeal to this Tribunal the Appellant provided detailed background information that demonstrated that he was indeed “the individual” concerned. 6. The Grounds of Appeal disclose that it was the Appellant who, while working for the BBC on a temporary basis in 2011, had reported a perceived data security breach in the BBC’s systems. He had subsequently escalated the notification to senior management because he felt that the manager to whom it had first been reported was taking no action. At around the same time he had complained to the BBC’s Human Resource team that he had been bullied and harassed by the same manager and he subsequently instructed solicitors to seek compensation from the BBC for having terminated his engagement. In 2012, he reported his suspicions of a security breach to the Information Commissioner who had ultimately decided that the BBC had taken appropriate steps to deal with the security risk and that the investigation could therefore be closed. 7. The Appellant went on to explain in the Grounds of Appeal that in February 2015 he had come across the report referred to in the Request and this discovery lead him to enquire into the outcome of his complaints about both data security and harassment. He did this by first utilising his rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) to access his own personal data and, subsequently, by submitting the Request.8. The Grounds of Appeal therefore show that the Information Commissioner need not have considered the complex provisions of the FOIA that determine whether or not the protection of an individual’s personal data justify a “neither confirm nor deny” response to an information request. In the case of an individual seeking his or her own information the relevant provisions are clear on this point. They read: “40. Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. … (5) The duty to confirm or deny— (a)does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and …” 9. The Grounds of Appeal do not challenge the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that the information sought under the Second and Third Requests constituted personal data. And it certainly seems to us to fall within the definition of personal data set out in section 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) which provides: “’personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller” 10. It seems to us, also, that the information sought in the First Request – information about the outcome of an investigation into the Appellant/requester’s own whistleblowing action – also constitutes his personal data. Similarly, in relation to the Fourth Request, information about communications between the Appellant and the BBC regarding the outcome of the Information Commissioner’s investigation, instigated by his own original complaint, would also constitute his personal data. It follows that all of the First to Third Requests and part of the Fourth Request clearly falls within FOIA section 40(1). The result is that the BBC had no obligation to disclose that information or to give any indication as to whether or not it held it. 11. Because the rest of the information in the Fourth Request would not amount to personal data (and in case we were held to be wrong in categorising, as personal, the information sought under the rest of that Fourth Request and the whole of the First Request), it is necessary for us to consider whether the Information Commissioner was right in her conclusion that the information was not held by the BBC at the time of the Request.12. Paragraphs 25 to 36 of the Decision Notice record the detailed enquiries made by the BBC and the outcome of those enquiries. At first sight, the searches carried out by the BBC appear to have been thorough. They appear to have been based on a careful analysis of the relevant Parts of the Request and to have been directed at the appropriate sections of the BBC’s records. The fact that those efforts produced information that, while not falling within the scope of any part of the Request, did cover related subject matter, is further confirmation that the search efforts had been appropriately directed. 13. It is not possible to say, with absolute certainty, that a particular item of information is not held somewhere within an organisation of the size of the BBC. The most that can be done is to assess whether it is likely, on a balance of probabilities, to be so held. That assessment can only be made on the basis of the evidence provided about the targeting, scope and rigour of the searches that were made in response to the Request, which should be set against any criticisms of those efforts presented by the Appellant or arising from the Tribunal’s own assessment of them. 14. The Grounds of Appeal contained no criticism of the BBC’s search efforts or the Information Commissioner’s decision in respect of the First Request. As to the Fourth Request they contain no more than an assertion, without evidential support, that the Information Commissioner was wrong to have concluded that it was not possible to link the incidence of whistleblowing in 2012 to the investigation carried out in 2013. 15. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 16. In our view, the Grounds of Appeal identify no basis on which it can be said that the Information Commissioner fell into error in the fact-finding exercise that formed the basis of this part of the Decision Notice. 17. For the reasons set out above we have decided that the Appeal must be dismissed. 18. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Chris Ryan Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 14 March 2018"
"15","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0144 Determined, by consent, on written evidence and submissions Before Judge David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Members Anne Chafer and Narendra Makanji Between Kevin Scranage (“KS”) Appellant and The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) RespondentReferences in the form “s.14” are to that numbered section of the Freedom of Information Act, 2000 (“FOIA”) The “DN” is the ICO’s Decision Notice. Decision and Reasons The Tribunal finds that, insofar as the questions contained in KS’s letter to Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council (“Oldham”) dated 11th. December, 2016 constitute requests for “information”, as defined in s.84, they were vexatious for the purposes of s.14. It therefore dismisses the appeal. Oldham is not required to take any further step. . The Background 1. KS worked as a Trading Standards Officer, later a Senior Trading Standards Officer for Rochdale MBC (“Rochdale”) for several years ending in April, 2009. He was good at the job. He is disabled and suffers from poor health. During the latter years of his service he states that he was bullied and intimidated by senior officers, Mr. G and Mrs. M, culminating in disciplinary proceedings, which they falsely orchestrated to procure his dismissal. KS was suffering from stress and depression at the time. 2. KS took action against Rochdale before the Employment Tribunal, evidently claiming that he was unfairly dismissed. He took up a similar post at Oldham. Mrs. M also moved from Rochdale to Oldham. The exact dates of these moves are unknown to the Tribunal. There is no evidence that any mistreatment of KS by Mrs. M occurred during her service at Oldham. It is not clear that she had any direct contact with him.3. Relations between KS on the one hand and Mr. G and Mrs. M on the other seem to have further deteriorated. They accused him of harassment and he was convicted by Bury and Rochdale Magistrates, on 17th. December, 2014, of an offence under s.2 of the Protection from Harassment Act, 1997 in relation to them. He appealed successfully against that conviction to Manchester Crown Court in 2015. 4. He seeks to rely on the judgment delivered by H.H. Judge Lever to support his case as to the abuse he suffered at the hands of Mr. G and Mrs. M and the support given to them by Rochdale (in so far as such matters are relevant to this appeal). However, we are told (though no copy of the order was exhibited) that a Restraining Order was made, which, among other provisions forbade him from “publicizing or attempting to publicize by any means” the ruling given by H.H.Judge Lever. Yet that ruling was provided to the ICO by KS and was included in the agreed bundle for this appeal. 5. This appears to be a clear breach by KS of the Restraint Order made by Manchester Crown Court in 2015. For this Tribunal to have regard to that finding or to any part of HH Judge Lever’s judgment would involve us, not just in disregarding the order, but in rewarding KS for his disobedience to it. We therefore refuse to admit any part of HH Judge Lever’s judgment in evidence. I shall direct that the agreed bundle and a copy of this Decision be sent to HH Judge Lever so that he may consider, if he chooses, whether the Restraining Order has been breached and what consequences follow. 6. If KS wanted to rely on that ruling as part of his case, he should have applied to HH Judge Lever for a variation of the Restraint Order. He simply ignored it. We should add that this apparent disobedience to the order of the Court has no bearing on the issue of vexatiousness because it formed part of the presentation of his case to the ICO and the Tribunal, not his dealings with Oldham. We say “apparent” – because it is not for the Tribunal but for Manchester Crown Court, if it chooses, to determine whether KS’s disclosure of the ruling in this appeal was indeed a breach.7. We are left with KS’ allegations against Rochdale, which are set out repeatedly in the documents in the bundle. 8. The material requests for information, summarized in the next paragraph, were addressed to Oldham, not Rochdale. Whether or not Rochdale was guilty of misconduct towards KS is of little, if any, relevance to the question whether Oldham was justified in invoking s.14(1). The only apparent links between Rochdale and Oldham, in the context of this appeal, were that Rochdale and then Oldham employed both KS and Mrs.M. Employing Mrs. M, does not amount to condonation of any earlier misconduct, if such there was, even if there were evidence that, at the date of employing her, Oldham were aware of such allegations. Still less does it demonstrate a general policy of ignoring bullying and abuse. The Requests 9. On 11th. December, 2016, KS wrote a long letter to Oldham. It began with a forceful denunciation of Rochdale and an accusation that his “senior manager “was abusing him, which he linked to media reports of abuse in the world of football and the alleged cover – up by Rochdale of sexual abuse (which was widely reported and led to a number of prosecutions). He further asserted that a wide range of very senior officers at Rochdale, including in – house legal advisers, as well as every Rochdale councilor and senior figures in Greater Manchester Police supported and condoned the abuse that he had suffered, as very briefly described in §1. 10. He then proceeded to pose a series of ten questions, of which the general effect was to ask whether Oldham had been guilty of similar misconduct to that which he attributed to Rochdale. They read as follows – (i) What is your policy on abuse? (ii) Do you actually follow it? (iii)How many reports have you been notified of? (iv) Have you ever ignored reports of abuse like Rochdale MBC? (v) Have you ever attempted to cover abuse up like Rochdale MBC? If so, how many times?(vi) Have you ever assisted offender (sic) like Rochdale MBC in order to cover up abuse? If so, how many times? (vii) Have you ever lied to a court of law like Rochdale MBC in order to cover up abuse? If so, how many times? (viii) Have you ever withheld evidence from a court of law like Rochdale MBC in order to cover up abuse? If so, how many times? (ix) Do you work with Rochdale MBC in any collaborative ways? (x) Do you intend to change your working relationship with Rochdale MBC? KS states that broadly similar requests were sent to other local authorities. 11. Oldham responded on 12th. January, 2017, refusing to provide any of the requested information and relying on s.14(1), namely on the assertion that these requests were vexatious. It maintained that position following an internal review. 12. In her DN of 4th. July, 2017, the ICO considered Dransfield v ICO and Devon C.C. [2015] EWCA Civ 454 and upheld that refusal. KS appealed. 13. His Grounds of Appeal dwell largely on his criticisms of Rochdale, its officers and members. They include vague and wide – ranging references to different forms of misconduct in public life, which he purports to link together in a vast network of iniquity. He denies that the requests were vexatious. He asserts that they would assist in getting local councils to tackle “hate crime”, abuse, victimization and harassment, such as he suffered at Rochdale. He contends that, in employing Mrs.M, allegedly knowing of her conduct towards KS, Oldham condoned all the abuse that KS had suffered at Rochdale. He deserves answers to his questions on account of what he has suffered. The Tribunal’s reasons for dismissing this appeal. 14. These requests were the latest in a series of requests of a very similar nature, going back to September, 2013. Some information had been provided by Oldham, some was refused in reliance on exemptions including those relating to data protection and other available sources (s.21). Section 14 was not invoked in response to these earlier, closely related requests.This background has some significance in relation to an assessment of vexatiousness. KS had already demonstrated that he was likely to press ahead with repetitive and offensive questions, regardless of the responses that he obtained. 15. There is no evidence, nor any good reason to suspect that Oldham has conducted its duties as an employer in the way that KS imputes to Rochdale. Most of the requests are seemingly designed, not to obtain information but to make unfounded accusations in the form of questions (see (iv) – (x)). He cannot have expected to receive recorded information (see s.84) in response to them. The fact that similar requests were made to other local authorities in Lancashire reinforces that conclusion. 16. It may be relevant that Manchester Crown Court had prohibited FOIA requests to Rochdale so that KS had to vent his anger and frustration in other directions. Whether or not similar requests to Rochdale would have had a value to the public, there could be little or no public interest in the answers to such tendentious requests, framed in such offensive terms, made to Oldham, or any other council for that matter. 17. Looking at the matter in the round, we have no doubt at all that Oldham was entitled to rely on s.14(1) and to say that these requests were vexatious. They were almost entirely pointless, as regards eliciting useful information, had virtually no value to the public, were framed in insulting and potentially distressing terms and inevitably demanded time and resources quite disproportionate to their usefulness. Furthermore, they were the culmination of a quite sustained campaign along the same lines conducted over the preceding three years. KS was clearly not going to stop unless s.14 was brought into play. 18. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 19. This is a unanimous decision. Signed David Farrer Q.C.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in the case has been engaged in a bitter dispute about the administration of a charity which has involved long-running litigation. On 7 February 2016 he wrote to the Charity Commission asking for information about its dealings with the charity:- “All we want is information about your correspondence with the charity trustees and their answer and finally, your decision.” 2. The Charity Commission replied on 25 February 2016 relying on the exemption from disclosure contained in section 31 FOIA. This provides, so far as is relevant:- “Law enforcement. (1)Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— …. (g)the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (2)The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are— (a) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, (b) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, (c) the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise, (f) the purpose of protecting charities against misconduct or mismanagement (whether by trustees or other persons) in their administration, (g) the purpose of protecting the property of charities from loss or misapplication, (h) the purpose of recovering the property of charities, 2Appeal No: EA/2017/0015 17/0015 …” 3. The Charity Commission is responsible for the oversight of the many tens of thousands of charities in England and Wales, helping ensure that they comply with the law and that their assets are protected. In its response to the Appellant it explained its role as including: increasing trust and confidence in charities, promoting compliance by charity trustees with their legal obligations, identifying and investigating apparent misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities and taking appropriate remedial or protective action in connection with misconduct or mismanagement…” and that any information it had was held in furtherance of its statutory role. 4. Having explained its role the Charity Commission explained that the disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice its functions because if details of its correspondence were routinely disclosed the charities and other parties with which it dealt would be reluctant to co-operate with it or enter into frank exchanges with it. In addition disclosure could prejudice the decision-making about regulatory action. These consequences would prejudice the Charity Commission’s ability to take regulatory action. The public interest lay in not disclosing the information. On review the Charity Commission maintained this position. 5. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner (the ICO), who investigated. In her decision notice she noted that the Charity Commission’s role was protecting charities against misconduct and mismanagement. She considered the likely impact of disclosure would result in an impairment of its abilities to protect charities. While there was some interest in disclosing how a particular charity was functioning and in how the Charity Commission carried out its role she concluded that the strong public interest in an effective regulator for charities outweighed this and she upheld the Charity Commission’s position. The appeal to the Tribunal 6. The Appellant in the grounds of appeal set out three issues which, he argued, the ICO had failed to investigate. All three related to the administration of the charity in question and were, in essence, criticisms of how the Charity Commission had handled the charity. The appeal notice culminated in the statement:- “Since then, the Charity 3Appeal No: EA/2017/0015 17/0015 Commission has always favoured the wrong people”. In the statement of the outcome he was seeking from the appeal he wrote:- “I want the information revealing the whole truth. If that is not possible, the alternative is that they disclose correspondence between the charity trustees and the Charity Commission”. Annexed to the statement of case was a document which set out his concerns about the history of the charity and the Charity Commission’s dealings with it. He argued that the charity trustees had failed to comply with the law. He stated “The Charity Commission wants to argue and focus only on one point, not my wider complaint. I did not ask for exempt disclosure. The Charity Commission wants to argue within section31(2). Purchaser should have the same rights to argue.” He argued that people interested in the charity and its work wanted to know what was going on, that in his view the charity was now controlled by a few people and there was no public interest in maintaining the exemption:- “..trustees do not have any public interest and all the public is outside against them.” 7. Although the Appellant feels strongly about the charity with which he is concerned and, to that extent, his notice of appeal is an affirmation of the importance of disclosing information about that charity, he did not engage with the position of the Charity Commission and ICO that disclosure in this case would prejudice many others by weakening the ability of the Charity Commission to regulate effectively. 8. In replying the ICO argued that there were no identifiable grounds of appeal which set out why the decision notice was not in accordance with the law. It was not the role of the ICO or the tribunal to consider how the Charity Commission had dealt with the Appellant’s underlying concern. In supporting the ICO’s stance the Charity Commission noted that it functioned under law and so was subject to the High Court and its regulatory decisions could be challenged by judicial review or certain appeals within the Charity jurisdiction of the tribunal. The Charity Commission relied on all the subsections of section 31(2) listed above and emphasised the value of the charity Commission being able to promote the resolution of disputes about the running of 4Appeal No: EA/2017/0015 17/0015 charities so as to avoid the diversion of charitable resources to legal costs. Subsequent submissions by the Appellant and Charity Commission reinforced points already made. Consideration 9. The Appellant feels very strongly about this charity. However he has been unable to see beyond his very personal concerns to the fundamental argument adopted by the Charity Commission and the ICO. This is that maintaining a significant degree of confidentiality about the contacts between the Charity Commission and those it works with is more effective in building effective working relationships and securing the information it needs to regulate effectively. Parliament. in legislating FOIA. clearly recognised that all sorts of bodies concerned in law enforcement benefitted from that confidentiality in the effective conduct of their affairs. The tribunal accepts the considered opinion of the Charity Commission (endorsed by the ICO) that disclosure would be likely to prejudice the effective working of the Charity Commission. The arguments advanced by the Appellant have very little weight against this. The balance of public interest is clearly in maintaining the exemption. 10. This appeal is without merit. The ICO’s decision is correct in law. The appeal is dismissed. 11. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Hughes Date: 17 October 2017 5"

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Mr Sanders explained to the tribunal that he was involved in proceedings in the County Court relating to his leasehold flat; these were transferred to the Residential Property Tribunal in 2009. He was unhappy with procedural decisions made by the tribunal hearing his case. He spoke to tribunal staff and was told that he could complain to the President of the tribunal. He did so at some time between June and August 2009; she responded indicating that it was not for her to intervene. He continued to be dissatisfied. He unsuccessfully appealed the decision of the tribunal. 2. He said in March 2011 he sued the three members of the tribunal for misfeasance in public office. In about 2015 the Ministry of justice applied to be joined as a defendant and subsequently successfully applied for the proceedings to be struck out. 3. During the course of these proceedings Mr Sanders sent two communications, one to an email address at the First-tier Tribunal (Residential Property) (which discharges the functions of the Residential Property Tribunal following the re-organisation of tribunals under the provisions of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act) and the other to the judge who had been President of the Residential Property Tribunal in 2009. The request for information 4. Both communications are lengthy and are set out in full in the decision notice, however for convenience of analysis they are summarised. 5. The communication of 18 December 2014 makes reference to “matters arising in 2009 and thereafter” and there are then 12 numbered paragraphs. Paragraph 1 quotes from a tribunal document explaining the procedure of the tribunal, paragraph 2 claims “there is some ambiguity”, paragraphs 3-11 then explore hypothetical situations raised by Mr Sander’s litigation, and 3-7 deal with the role of the President 2Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 culminating in: “7. If the president appears corrupt and denies he/she has any responsibility..” Paragraphs 8-11 deal with members of the tribunal culminating in: “11. In the alternative, are the aforementioned paid not to resolve such disputes… whilst continuing to accept their salary as paid for out of the public purse?” Paragraph 12 asks for information: “Please provide all the information held on and around these subjects as disclosed hereinabove in this email.” 6. On Christmas morning 2014 Mr Sanders wrote to the judge about issues raised in his litigation in 9 numbered paragraphs preceded by: “2. I wrote to you on 8 July 2010. You have evaded and/or failed to deal lawfully or at all inter alia the following complaints and requests for information which were part of the aforementioned correspondence..” The communication concluded: “Kindly therefore reply in full in accordance with your duties and my rights without further prevarication, evasion or delay. Please provide all the information held on and around the subjects referred to and/or touched on herein. I register a further formal complaint with regard to your personal misconduct as demonstrated inter alia by your refusal to engage with the quoted paragraphs.” 7. The Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”) in refusing to comply with these requests stated that neither “request” fell within s8 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”)which provides:- “8 Request for information. (1)In this Act any reference to a “request for information” is a reference to such a request which— (a)is in writing, (b)states the name of the applicant and an address for correspondence, and (c)describes the information requested…” 8. The MoJ told Mr Sanders that:- “Your requests for information do not describe the information sought, they pose many questions requiring clarification or opinion on 3Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 matters in respect of your legal matters. The FOIA only covers recorded information rather than advice or opinion.” 9. The MoJ further argued that the communication addressed to the judge was not within FOIA as it was not addressed to a public authority as required by s3:- “Public authorities (1)In this Act “public authority” means— (a)subject to section 4(4), any body which, any other person who, or the holder of any office which— (i)is listed in Schedule 1, or (ii)is designated by order under section 5, or (b)a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6.” The complaint to the Information Commissioner 10. Mr Sanders complained to the Information Commissioner (“ICO”). In considering whether the communications were valid requests within s8 she noted the argument of the MoJ that: “it is not possible for the MoJ to conduct a search for “all information” around a hypothetical event, or indeed why an individual has acted towards or responded to the requester in a certain way. Much of the requester’s correspondence asks for clarity around situations or events which does not meet the criteria for recorded information..” While acknowledging that there was a low threshold for the description of the information in the request she concluded that the communications were not requests for information, rather Mr Sanders was using FOIA as a means of advancing his arguments concerning his dispute with the MoJ. The ICO considered the definition of a public authority. She noted the position she had taken with respect to a previous similar request that the judiciary were not within s3 FOIA. She relied on a decision of the First-tier Tribunal which upheld that decision. She concluded that a judge did not fall within the definition and accordingly the Christmas morning communication to the judge was not a valid request for this reason also. 4Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 The appeal to the Tribunal 11. Mr Sanders’ notice of appeal consists of 20 numbered paragraphs. Paragraphs 1-9 are criticisms of the tribunal panel which considered his case in 2009, paragraph 10 criticises the ICO. Mr Sanders argues in paragraphs 11-12 that the judge “could not only have been a member of an independent judiciary since she had various email addresses… some were HMCS/HMCTS addresses and some of these were/are judicial email addresses”. Paragraphs 13-16 deal with possible complaint procedures for dealing with a complaint against a judge, paragraphs 17-20 criticise the MoJ and the ICO’s acceptance of information provided by the MoJ. 12. The ICO resisted the appeal relying on the reasoning of her decision notice. With respect to the status of the judge she argued:- “the Appellant does not appear to dispute that [the judge] was a member of the judiciary, but instead appears to submit that she was not necessarily acting as a member of the judiciary when she received the Second Request. … The Commissioner considers that a judge will likely perform a number of functions that would fall within the remit of the judiciary, and submits that the Appellant has failed to set out why [the judge] was not acting as a member of the judiciary at the time of the request. … The Commissioner does not consider the use of a HMCTS email address to indicate that [the judge] was acting otherwise than as a member of the judiciary.” . 13. The Commissioner also noted that Mr Sanders was fully aware of the MoJ FOIA procedures “yet chose to submit the Second Request directly to [the judge], a point which is indisputable given that the email was addressed directly to her. This indicates that the purpose of the second Request was to obtain information from her which was connected with her judicial function, rather than requesting information from the MoJ in the usual manner.” 14. In responding to the ICO’s case Mr Sanders argued that he had not written solely to the judge on Christmas Day 2014 since: “the email in question was also sent to numerous other recipients all of whom were either employees of HMCTS or the generic inbox for RPT London (HMCTS) enquiries”. He suggested that in 2010 he was not aware that the judge was a judge when he first wrote to her. He noted the ICO’s position that judges were constitutionally separate from the administration and 5Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 argued that: “Judges do not have HMCS/HMCTS email addresses as standard unless they also perform some other non-judicial role”. 15. In the tribunal Mr Sanders argued that it was a factual question whether the individual was only a judge and he suggested that she may have had another role. He pointed to the difficulty a requester had of knowing what precise information was held which would answer his request, and said that he had been seeking information of how a President of a tribunal exercises her responsibilities. He had not been exploring hypothetical scenarios but had been trying to get information to move forwards. He noted that the MoJ had argued that a previous request to them had been vexatious; however that had been totally different. Consideration 16. In his appeal Mr Sanders has not challenged the reasoning of the ICO that a judge is not a public authority within s3 FOIA. Although Mr Sanders claimed that when he first wrote to the judge in 2010 to complain about the conduct of a tribunal panel he was not aware that he was writing to a judge, when he wrote on Christmas Day 2014 he did know. Although he claims that the possession of a HMCTS email address points to the judge exercising a non-judicial function and that a complaints function with respect to members of a tribunal may not be a judicial function, these propositions are neither evidence nor convincing arguments. The possession of an email address may simply be a convenience and a matter of how the email system of a particular tribunal has been administered. The role of a President of a tribunal includes handling complaints about tribunal members, however this complaint handling does not extend to the content of their judicial decisions. That is a matter for appeal. The tribunal is satisfied that the ICO was correct to conclude that Mr Sanders wrote to the judge about her judicial work. The fact that he copied the email to other recipients is irrelevant. He wrote to her, complaining about her actions and sought a reply from her. 17. Furthermore the content of both communications was not seeking information that was likely to be held. They were written against the background of a claim alleging misconduct and they advance arguments and criticisms. They were a misuse of the statutory procedure for the purpose of conducting a dispute, not to seek information. 6Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 18. The tribunal is satisfied that the ICO in her decision correctly analysed the factual position and came to the only possible conclusion with respect to s3 and s8. 19. This appeal is without merit and is dismissed. 20. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 3 October 2017 7"
"18","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0038 Heard at Birmingham On 7th. August, 2017 Before Judge David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Members Jean Nelson and Henry Fitzhugh Between Terence Cartwright Appellant and The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) RespondentMr. Cartwright appeared in person The ICO did not appear but made written submissions. The Decision of the Tribunal The Tribunal finds (i) that the requests numbered 4, and 5 at p.2 of the Decision Notice were manifestly unreasonable for the purpose of regulation 12(4)(b) of the Environmental Information Regulations, 2004. (ii) that request 6 was vexatious within FOIA s.14. (iii) that requests 2 and 3 were not manifestly unreasonable and East Hampshire District Council (“EHDC”) is ordered to respond to them within 28 days of the publication of this decision. (iv) To the extent indicated in paragraph (iii) this appeal is allowed. 1. This appeal arises from the granting by EHDC of planning permission for two housing developments. Both aroused intense local concern. 2. The first, known as the Doone development, was granted by EHDC on 22nd. January, 2015. Its relevance to this appeal lies largely in the ill – feeling which the granting of permission caused, very shortly before the decision on the second application, within a large group of local residents, among whom Mr. Cartwright took a leading role. He had engaged in a great deal of correspondence with EHDC over these issues before either application was determined. He lives in Selborne, close to the Doone development. 3. The second application related to the South Alton Plan. Although Mr. Cartwright lives outside the relevant ward, this application had wider implications for neighbouring areas, including Selborne. The proposeddevelopment was substantial and would probably generate a significant increase in local traffic. It attracted substantial opposition, both in respect of traffic and visual issues. A critical question was whether it would require the demolition of Butts Bridge, a valued local landmark, and its replacement by a wider bridge. The application proposed its replacement. 4. On 4th. February, 2015, the Planning Committee recommended that permission be granted. 5. The minutes of that meeting, which were helpfully set out, so far as material, in the ICO’s Response to the Notice of Appeal, suggest some confusion or uncertainty among councillors as to a requirement by Hampshire County Council (“HCC”), the highway authority, for the replacement of Butts Bridge as a condition of any housing development. It is necessary to summarise the recorded strands of the argument in order to put requests 2 and 3 (see §14) in their proper context. 6. The District Valuer had submitted a Viability Report to EHDC in November, 2014. It was based on the understanding that, for the previous ten years or thereabouts, HCC had placed a moratorium on residential development in Alton until Butts Bridge had been widened, to improve traffic capacity and in the interests of safety. The application apparently proposed demolition and replacement of the bridge. Given the substantial increase in development costs, the District Valuer proposed a halving of the requirement for affordable housing within the development from 40% to 20%, a very significant modification of the “housing mix”. . 7. Councillor Maynard stated that the above assumption was wrong. The HCC transport manager had written in December, 2011 and again in December, 2014, denying that development of the relevant site wasconditional upon the replacement of Butts bridge. Its demolition could not be justified on that basis. 8. Councillor Branch referred to the Viability Report and argued that it was based on a false premise. The District Valuer, he said, was plainly unhappy with the conclusion that he had reached but could only act on what he was told. 9. The Development Manager and his colleagues states that access to Alton was a longstanding problem and that the bridge must be rebuilt if this site was to be developed. 10. Councillor Joy, whose ward includes Butts Bridge, referred to the great problems associated with the application, the doubts over the Viability Report, the visual impact of such a development, the reduction in the affordable housing requirement and the need for clarity over the assumptions underlying the Viability Report. He asked for a deferral of the decision until that and other uncertainties relating to the Neighbourhood Plan and a strategic transport infrastructure study had been resolved. 11. However, the recommendation for approval was carried by eight votes to two with three abstentions. That recommendation was approved by EHDC in July, 2015, following the Secretary of State’s decision not to call in the application. 12. In the year following the Planning Committee meetings in January and February, 2015, there was an intensive email correspondence between Mr. Cartwright and various EHDC officers relating to the two decisions and how EHDC dealt with them. Mr. Cartwright’s made emphatic complaints as to his treatment and the alleged shortcomings of EHDC. Those emails,when copied in the agreed bundle, covered about 130 pages of A4. We deal with the content and character of these exchanges later in this decision. 13. Shortly before the requests which feature in this appeal, Mr. Cartwright was involved in an exchange of emails with Councillor Cowper, the leader of EHDC, on the subject of Butts Bridge, which resulted in a meeting on 7th. March, 2016. Mr. Cartwright asserted at the hearing, although, we find, his assertion was not directly supported by subsequent emails, that Councillor Cowper had admitted at that meeting that information as to the Butts Bridge issue, so far as it related to the South Alton decision, had been withheld by EHDC because of embarrassment at the way it had handled it. This was a significant factor, said Mr. Cartwright, in his decision to make some of the requests for information which we are required to assess 14. On 3rd. March, 11th. April, 28th.April and 10th. May, 2016, Mr. Cartwright made seven requests, which were, in summary form: (i) As to the Doone development, had there been a second application in relation to changes in the type of house? That question was answered in due course in the Refusal Notice on 28th. July, 1916. (ii) As to the South Alton application, he requested a copy of a posting on the EHDC website, which “the (planning) committee might not have seen” concerning the “unease” of the District Valuer, (“who could only work on what he was told”), over the “methodology and conclusion” of the report, which was referred to, in those italicized terms, by Councillor Branch at the planning meeting (see §8) and(iii) copies of the District Valuer’s report and of HCC’s rebuttal of the statement that it had imposed conditions as to Butt’s Bridge on any residential development. (These requests were repeated on 28th. April.) (iv) He requested the “yellow sheets” distributed to councillors before the planning meeting of 4th. February, 2015 and answers to the questions, whether to all councillors before the meeting and, if so, when and by what means. Yellow sheets provide updated information on material, such as agenda and reports, previously sent. (v) He asked for copies of two letters from HCC referred to at page 1 of the yellow sheets. This might imply that he had already seen the yellow sheets or their content. (vi) Following an indication by letter of 11th. April, 2016 that EHDC was treating his requests as vexatious, he requested a copy of its policy on vexatious requests. It seems that there was no written policy. (vii) He requested a copy of EHDC’s written policy relating to FOIA. In its refusal notice EHDC directed him to a link on its website. That is a positive response to the request. It is apparent that nothing really hinges on whether (vi) is vexatious. Nevertheless, that does not exclude it from assessment as to those characteristics nor, like (i) and (vii), from forming part of the overall picture of Mr. Cartwright’s communications with EHDC. 15 As indicated, the Executive Director of EHDC responded on 11th. April, 2016, summarizing the correspondence of the previous twelve months,stating that further requests would be treated as vexatious, advising Mr. Cartwright of his right to complain to the Local Government Ombudsman (which he did) and stating that EHDC had answered comprehensively every legitimate inquiry. 16. However, Mr. Cartwright continued his requests the same day, emphasising that requests (ii) and (iii) were made under FOIA. Thereafter he maintained a steady flow of complaints and criticisms until 29th. July, 2016, when the EHDC Governance and Information Manager wrote informing him that requests 2 – 6 were being treated as vexatious, answering (i) and providing a web link for (vii). She made clear that this decision took account of EHDC’s dealings with Mr. Cartwright over a substantial period. 17. Mr. Cartwright complained to the ICO. EHDC had stated that no internal review was possible because so many of its officers had been involved in its confrontation with him. 18. The ICO’s Decision Notice (“the DN”) was issued on 16th. January, 2017. It upheld EHDC’s decision in respect of all seven requests, even those which had been answered on 29th. July, 2016. It did not differentiate one from another to any significant degree but applied familiar tests in determining that (ii) – (v) were manifestly unreasonable (Environmental Information Regulations r. 12(4)(b)) and (vi) vexatious (FOIA s.14(1)) 19. Mr. Cartwright appealed. His grounds of appeal are extensive and focus closely on the DN, which it criticizes paragraph by paragraph. Such an approach does not always identify clearly the central points in the case which the appellant advances and that is the case here. Those grounds were later supplemented by a detailed Reply to the ICO’s Response, to which were attached a series of Appendices, which included correspondence with the EHDC leader and its solicitor. Further written submissions wereadmitted at the hearing on a provisional basis; in the event, they contained nothing new of relevance which the ICO might wish to answer. Mr. Cartwright made further extensive oral submissions to the Tribunal, most, but not all of which repeated points made on paper. Besides that, the Tribunal had received an agreed bundle of documents, running to about 500 pages, which appeared to include every email that passed between Mr. Cartwright and EHDC over and beyond the relevant eighteen month period from January 2015 to August, 2016. 20. Mr. Cartwright ‘s case, in its material particulars was that: <U+F0B7> the issues that were raised by these requests were all of substantial public importance; <U+F0B7> the public interest would be served by the disclosure of every requested document ; <U+F0B7> no contrary interest outweighed that interest; <U+F0B7> the DN failed to apply the presumption in favour of disclosure, provided by regulation 12(2) of the EIR [2004]; <U+F0B7> they had not been answered because of fundamental flaws in the governance of EHDC and the evasive inclinations of the members and officers with whom he dealt; <U+F0B7> his complaint had been determined on the basis of a (false) judgement that he was vexatious/ manifestly unreasonable , not his requests; <U+F0B7> past history and contacts had been wrongly taken into account, whereas the question was simply the character of the requests under consideration; <U+F0B7> the decision erroneously took account of an EHDC contention that he had made unfounded allegations of fraud against an EHDC officer. 21. It must be clear that the Tribunal is not concerned with the merits of the planning decisions or the alleged shortcomings in the ICO’s investigation. Its task is simply to determine whether the ICO’s decision was “in accordancewith the law”, that is to say, produced the right result. It is not concerned with how she got there. It applies its own view of the law, which is rarely contentious, to the facts as it finds them, on evidence which may be different from that presented to the ICO. 22 The ICO’s Response acknowledged an undue concentration in the DN on the Doone issues rather than South Alton. She provided a full written analysis of the case on requests (ii) – (v), applied to the evidence the principles derived from Dransfield v Devon C.C. and ICO [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) 16; [2015] EWCA 454 and concluded that the character, frequency and content of Mr. Cartwright’s emails and the requests seen in the context of those emails was manifestly unreasonable. 23. The relevant law can be shortly summarized. The first question is whether requests (ii) – (vi) are subject to FOIA or the EIR [2004]. Information is “environmental in formation”, hence subject to the EIR, if it falls within r. 2. R 2(b) includes information on “ . . . plans, programmes, . . .and activities affecting or likely to affect (the state of the land, soil, land, landscape and natural sites . . ). That plainly applies to requests (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) (the material information on the yellow sheets relating to the second application and letters referred to therein). So, in relation to them, the question is whether, taken in overall context, they are manifestly unreasonable. Equally clearly, it does not cover request (vi). So the issue, under FOIA, is whether it is vexatious. Having said that, it is doubtful in this, as in many appeals, whether the result will depend on which jurisdiction applies. 24. Mr. Cartwright is, of course, entirely right in stating that, in the case of either test, it is applied to the request, not the requester. That is of considerable importance in this appeal. 25 A public authority must, as he states, apply a presumption in favour of disclosure (EIR r.12(2). Even where it is manifestly unreasonable, it mayrefuse to disclose it only if, additionally, it can show that “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in (refusal) outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information”. (r.12(1)(b))1. 26 “Manifestly unreasonable” is not defined in the EIR but is closely akin to “vexatious”, given that disproportionality is a key feature of the latter term – see Dransfield (CA) at 453. Its characteristics include the volume and burden of requests in relation to the importance of the issue(s), the motive of the requester – for example, to cause delay or disruption, to increase workload for no good purpose, to irritate or frustrate. The frequent adoption of an aggressive manner designed to intimidate or cause distress and the creation of a sense that no answer will ever stem the flow or even cascade of demands are further common examples of the manifestly unreasonable request. 27 It follows from what appears above that, contrary to Mr. Cartwright’s submissions, requests should be viewed in the context of what occurred before and, sometimes, after they were made. Any other approach would have the absurd result that a public authority could never argue that an endless stream of requests was an unreasonable burden, providing that each, taken in isolation, could be answered without difficulty. Plainly, taken individually, none of the seven requests here required much effort to answer. The reasons for our decision 28 We have no doubt that, viewed over the eighteen month period involved in this appeal, Mr. Cartwright’s correspondence with EHDC over the two planning applications was manifestly unreasonable and vexatious. More 1 Bizarrely, though of no consequence here, the same provisions as to presumption of disclosure and public interest apply where, as, it seems, here in request (vi), the authority does not hold the information at all.materially, we are sure that the same goes for the majority of FOIA requests (as he took them to be) that he made, including those not covered by this appeal, viewed against the background of offensive communications with which he bombarded EHDC. We have had the advantage of reading them, first in documents introduced by Mr. Cartwright, then, comprehensively, so far as we can see, in the two hundred and fifty pages of emails between Mr. Cartwright and EHDC submitted by EHDC and included in the agreed bundle. 29 The tone of Mr. Cartwright’s correspondence is almost unwaveringly hostile, supercilious, hectoring or, still worse, intimidating. It must have consumed hundreds of hours of council time, including the time of senior staff and the council solicitor. Whether it included accusations of fraud or other defamatory material we do not propose to determine because the offensive style and the relentless pressure in respect of any minor point which he adjudged unanswered are more than sufficient to justify such an assessment. We have no doubt that any further appellate tribunal seised of this matter would can get to the nub of this appeal by simply reading the email evidence. 30 All the unanswered requests must be assessed by reference to the whole corpus of demands and criticisms. 31 As regards, (iv), (v) and (if unanswered) (vi), we consider them to be of very limited public interest. There is no evidence that the yellow sheets contained anything of significance to the issue of HCC’s stance on South Alton or its presentation in the District Valuer’ s report. The same goes for the two letters referred to in those sheets. Their context suggests that these requests were made largely to keep up the pressure on EHDC, regardless of their intrinsic value. We should add that we have not seen either the sheets or the letters but conclude that Mr. Cartwright probably saw copies of the sheets at sometime, though the point is of little importance. As to the request for EHDC’s written policy on the application of s.14 ((vi)), the same judgement applies, since any dispute as to whether the material request is vexatious will be determined by the ICO or, if appealed, the Tribunal. Had there been some evidence of a written s.14 code, created by EHDC, which appeared to flout the accepted interpretation of this provision, the position might be different. There is none, however. 32 There is a powerful public interest in protecting public authorities from wastage of time and resources on burdensome and fruitless inquiries. It firmly outweighs any such interest in disclosure of any of the requested documents. We have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal to the extent that it relates to (iv), (v) and, assuming that it was not answered, (vi). 33 However, we find that the position is different, when we confront requests (ii) and (iii). We bear well in mind the manner, described above, in which these requests were presented and pursued. Nonetheless, the intrinsic importance of the issues underlying these requests, whatever Mr. Cartwright’s epistular style and motives, creates a public interest in their disclosure altogether more substantial than those so far considered. 34 It is clear that, as at February, 2015, HCC was not seeking to impose any embargo on development which failed to include the replacement, widening or other improvement of Butts Bridge. Yet the critical Viability Report from the District Valuer stated the converse, although, so it seems, with some reluctance or dismay. The affordable housing element in the development must be drastically reduced, in accordance with the report, on the premise that HCC’s support required that Butts Bridge be demolished or radically altered. There was in existence, it seems, at the date of the meeting, a written contradiction of any such premise in the shape of a document from HCC but it was evidently not presented to the meeting. The minutes may conveysome sense of understandable confusion among councillors and there was reference to deferment for clarification. Yet the decision to recommend was taken. The motives of the majority who supported approval cannot be known. Whether they approved an application which included the replacement of Butts Bridge, only because they believed that HCC would not accept residential development on any other basis, is simply speculation. Yet this was a very sensitive and socially significant development. If the decision was taken on a materially false basis, that must be a matter of considerable public concern, even though, by the date of the request, the die was cast – permission had been granted and a s.106 agreement (for associated work to be paid for by the developer) had been signed. 35 We do not consider that the email correspondence between him and the council leader around March, 2016 provides substantial support for his claim that Councillor Cowper acknowledged that information was being suppressed to cover up EHDC embarrassment over the handling of the critical meeting. However, the first paragraph of his email to Councillor Cowper of 8th. March, 2016 (Agreed bundle p. 91), referring to the leader’s “frankness” at the meeting the previous evening, is consistent with a concession of some kind as to the way that the application was handled. The most obvious point for concern was the possible (unintended) misleading of committee members on the issue of HCC’s attitude to the development. 36 Taking account of all these matters, the Tribunal finds that, whilst disclosure of the three items of information requested might well fail to resolve entirely any doubts as to whether committee members voted under a misconception on a very important issue, they are all potentially relevant to an investigation of that issue, particularly the report itself. 37 We have already indicated (in §34) that this remains a matter of significant public interest. Despite the matters which point to the need to protect HCCfrom an unending campaign of cross examination, we find that the public interest in disclosure of the information covered by requests (ii) and (iii) is not outweighed by such a need. To that extent this appeal is allowed. That means that EHDC must reply to these requests, stating whether it holds responsive information (which it clearly does) and providing it, subject to any appropriate EIR exceptions on which it can properly rely. 38 Lest it be thought by any party or interested person that this opens the door to a resumption of the kind of correspondence described in this decision, further EIR/FOIA requests on topics already covered in this lengthy saga or complaints to EHDC as to earlier requests, the Tribunal considers that EHDC would be entirely justified in invoking FOIA s.14 or EIR r. 12(4)(b), as the case may be, in respect of any further attempt to rake over any of these matters, even in terms more temperate and appropriate than those that featured all too frequently in the voluminous exchanges set before us. 39 For these reasons the Tribunal allows this appeal to the extent indicated . 40 This is a unanimous decision.

"19","Substantive Refusal","EA/2016/0294 JOHN MCEVOY Appellant and The Information Commissioner First Respondent Southern Regional College Second Respondent Appeal Hearing on the Papers: 16 August 2017 Fleetbank House, London Judgment delivered 21 August 2017 Before: Brian Kennedy QC Rosalind Tatam Steve Shaw Subject Matter: Application of exemptions Sections 40 (1) & (2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Result: Appeal Refused. Cases considered: Waugh v IC and Doncaster College EA/2008/0038.REASONS Introduction: [1]. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“DN”) dated 2 November 2016 (reference FS50635346) which is a matter of public record. The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat to consider this case on 16th August 2017. Factual Background to this Appeal: [2]. Full details of the background to this appeal, Mr McEvoy’s request for information and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice and not repeated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether the Southern Regional College (“the College”) was correct to rely on the s40 FOIA personal information exemption to withhold a report of an investigation conducted into matters raised by the Appellant under the College’s Whistle blowing Policy. Chronology: 8 Oct 2015 Appellant raises allegations against colleagues (arising from a meeting in April 2014) to the College under its Whistle blowing policy. 11 Dec 2015 Appellant is informed of the outcome of the College’s investigation 3 Feb 2016 Appellant’s request for the report following the investigation into issues he had raised through the College’s Whistle blowing Policy 24 Feb 2016 College refuses request, citing s40 (1) and (2) 9 March 2016 Appellant requests an internal review 8 April 2016 College upholds original refusal 27 June 2016 Appellant’s complaint to the Commissioner Relevant Legislation: s40 FOIA Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject.(2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if - (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (4) The second condition is that by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(c) of that Act (data subject’s right of access to personal data). Commissioner’s Decision Notice: [3] The Commissioner was satisfied that, where the Appellant’s personal data was contained within the report, the College was entitled to rely on and cite the exemption in s40(1) in regards to the FOIA request. The separate Data Protection Act aspect is not within the scope of this Decision Notice. [4] Section 40(2) deals with third party personal information. The Appellant had raised concerns about two particular members of staff, and the Commissioner considered that those staff members could be identified as their names, job titles and other information in the report. Where the requested information deals with internal matters that could invoke disciplinary policies, there is a strong expectation on the part of the identifiable individuals of privacy: See: Waugh v IC and Doncaster College EA/2008/0038. The Commissioner considered that any disclosure of the disputed information would cause unnecessary and unjustifiable stress to these individuals, who have refused to consent to the disclosure of the information. The Commissioner also noted that theseindividuals had not been found to have any case to answer, while disclosure of the report committed could lead to unwarranted speculation. [5] Whilst there is a general public interest in transparency and accountability, the Commissioner accepted that the Appellant maintained the view that wrongdoing did occur and it was important to him to know why the College did not uphold his concerns. Nevertheless, the Commissioner found that this did not override the strong public interest in protecting the privacy rights of individuals who have been found to have done nothing wrong. The Commissioner found that the College, the public authority concerned, had provided the Appellant with all the information that he as a Whistle- blower was entitled to receive, and the Commissioner was, and remains, of the view that the public at large is not entitled to receive the details. Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal: Ground I – Public Interest [6] The Appellant claimed that the College failed to retain audit and compliance evidence in what he suspects to be institutional corruption. If the College’s leadership and accountability systems are in question, there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of the report. Ground II – Commissioner’s Bias [7] The Appellant further alleged that the Decision Notice was “partisan”, “misleading” and discriminatory in favour of what the Appellant termed the “wrongdoers/offenders”, and failed to attach sufficient weight to the Appellant’s evidence of what he perceived to be the wrongdoing complained of. Commissioner’s Response: [8]. The Commissioner repeated the findings in the DN regarding the unjustifiable distress that disclosure would cause, noting that it was no surprise that the accused individuals refused consent for disclosure. Their reasonable expectations in privacy are supported by case law and there is no legitimate public interest. Ground I – Public Interest[9]. The Commissioner reasoned that whilst ensuring the integrity of the College’s internal systems is arguably in the public interest, this is more properly litigated within the regulatory context of the College as a provider of higher education. Ground II – Bias [10] The Commissioner refuted any accusations of impropriety and dishonesty, and noted that any such accusations were neither particularised nor substantiated. Appellant’s Reply: Ground I – Public Interest [11] The Appellant argues that he can prove irrefutably that there was malpractice in the conduct of the investigation into his allegations that amounts to a fraudulent whitewash in his view. Ground II – Bias [12] The Appellant claims that the Commissioner’s bias is evident in the sections of the Decision Notice “where she practically glosses over the two culprits’ fakery and deceitfulness”, and failed to include in her Notice a statement from the College’s Whistle blowing Protection Officer in which he allegedly confirms the destruction of documents at the commencement of the academic year 2015/16 which the Appellant believes contained vital evidence on his concerns. The College’s Response: [13] The College provided further information regarding the Appellant’s complaints. The report concluded that whilst it was unable to uphold the central allegations made by the Appellant, it did find that there was a breach of the exam board’s retention regulations. This was explained by a general failure within the College to properly understand these regulations, and as a result measures were put in place to rectify the situation. Ground I – Public Interest [14] The College agreed with the Commissioner’s conclusions regarding the exemptions relied upon, adding the following observations: i) Disclosure may unjustifiably lower the good standing of the individuals accused by the Appellant of misconduct. The investigation has concluded, and to publish thereport would revive the matter without permitted any recourse for the individuals concerned. It may also impact upon their ability to carry out their professional duties if there is undue speculation amongst colleagues and students. ii) The duty of trust and confidence to the individuals relates not only to the generic employment relationship between the College and the individuals, but is also explicitly protected in the Whistle blowing Policy. iii) The report is of limited interest to the general public. The Appellant’s allegations of systemic institutional impropriety on the part of the College are not covered in the report, which deals only with specific allegations against two individuals. The Audit Committee of the College receives a report on Whistle blowing investigations, and the College’s mechanisms are scrutinised by the internal auditors (KPMG), the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Department for the Economy. [15]. Disclosure would breach the first Data Protection principle as none of the Schedule 2 conditions have been met. Appellant’s Replies: [16] The Appellant refutes the College’s version of the investigation that resulted in the report, denying that there was a widespread failure of understanding on the part of staff members of the exam board’s retention policy, but rather a deliberate and fraudulent destruction of corporate assets to prevent disclosure of malpractice. He stated that this alleged criminal activity means that disclosure is in the public interest, as it will show that the College has been claiming public monies from the awarding body under false pretences. Conclusions: [17] The Appellant also raised the issue of redactions to solve the issue of the individuals being identifiable to the world at large. This we find demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of this appeal process. In any event, as he believes these individuals to be guilty of malpractice he is of the opinion that they should not be permitted to avail of the protection from distress that s40 provides. He also provided an assurance that, if the report were released to him, he would not disseminate it further, and gives his consent to his being identified by name.[18] Whilst the Appellant disagrees with the investigation, findings and report of the second Respondent, he has failed to produce such compelling evidence to establish the objections he has made as to persuade the First Respondent or this Tribunal that the College got it wrong. The First Respondent and this Tribunal have the advantage of seeing the disputed information in a closed bundle supplied to us but not the Appellant. It is personal and often sensitive information. [19] The Appellant has failed to persuade the Tribunal that the First Respondent erred on the facts or in the Law or was wrong in the reasoning in the DN, either with relevant evidence or persuasive argument. This Tribunal accepts and adopts the reasoning in the DN and does not find that the Appellant has undermined that reasoning. The Appellant’s final submissions make other requests of the Tribunal, which are beyond our jurisdiction (see his Paragraphs 12 ff of 20 June 2017). [20] The Tribunal find the Appellant’s statement regarding s77 FOIA is of no assistance because the information referred to by him was destroyed at the beginning of the academic year and was not the disputed information, the subject matter of this appeal (see Open Bundle pages 90-91, and the Appellants paragraphs 4 – 8 wherein he criticises the destruction of student folders). [21] In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above we refuse the Appeal. Brian Kennedy QC 21 August 2017"

Subject Matter: Public Authority claiming exemptions under s40 (2) & (3) Authorities cited: Linda Bromley and Information Commissioner v Environment Agency EA/2006/0072 Result: Appeal refused. REASONS Introduction [1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“DN”) dated 1 March 2017 (reference FS50643925) which is a matter of public record. [2] The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat to consider this case on 15th August 2017. Factual Background to this Appeal:[3] Full details of the background to this appeal, Mr Piggott’s request for information and the Commissioner’s DN are set out in the Decision Notice and not repeated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether North East Lincolnshire Council (“the Council”) held information pertaining to two individual living persons. CHRONOLOGY 22 June 2016 Appellant’s request for information on the qualifications of two officers along with building reports 12 July 2016 Council provided the reports but refused to provide the qualifications, citing s40(2) (personal information exemption) 19 July 2016 Appellant requests internal review 1 Aug 2016 Council upholds refusal under s40(2) 26 Aug 2016 Appellant complains to the Commissioner 4 Nov 2016 following further investigation, Council now claims that it does not hold the requested information 11 March 2017 DN FS506339 upholding the University’s reliance on s36 RELEVANT LEGISLATION s1 FOIA Information held or not held (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. COMMISSIONER’S DECISION NOTICE [4] The Commissioner must decide on the balance of probabilities whether the public authority holds the requested information. In the instant case, the Council provided the Commissioner with proof that the two individuals were not employed by the Council, and the Council had no access to the employee qualifications of its contractors. Whilst it conceded that one of the two individuals had been employed by the Council a number of years ago, the completion by that individual of any training, refreshers or subsequent qualifications are not available to the Council. The most that the Council was able to say is that it is aware that all employees of this contractor are required to complete a 2 day training course, which is supplemented by regular refresher courses / activities specific toHousing Health and Safety Ratings Systems and other housing and inspection related knowledge and training. The Council also pointed out that its operating guidance does not make any specific requirement for officers to hold any particular qualifications. NOTICE OF APPEAL [5] The Appellant requested clarification as to whether the Council did not hold the qualifications because the individuals at the time of the inspections were employed by another company, or because the individuals are not qualified. COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE [6] The Commissioner pointed out that Council had already confirmed that neither of the named officers were employees of the Council at the time of the inspections, and that there was no business purpose or statutory requirement to have access to the individuals’ qualifications as they were employed by another company. The test laid down in Linda Bromley and Information Commissioner v Environment Agency EA/2006/0072 is whether it can be found on the balance of probabilities that the information is held, taking into account the quality of the authority’s initial analysis of the request, the scope of the search made on the basis of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency of any such search. The Commissioner stands by her application of this test in finding that the Council does not hold the information. REPLY BY THE APPELLANT [7] The Appellant claimed that the Commissioner and the Council still haven’t confirmed whether they do not hold the information because the individuals are not qualified or because they are employees of a contractor. He made certain allegations about already holding personal knowledge of the qualifications of one of the individuals, and alleged bad faith on the part of the Council and the Commissioner in attempting to prevent a public authority being proved wrong in a public forum. The Appellant questioned the use of the Freedom of Information framework when public authorities can use third party partners in the exercise of their functions and then claim not to hold the relevant information. CONCLUSION: [8] The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Appellant that the Commissioner erred on the facts or in the Law in this matter. We accept that the principles in: Linda Bromley andInformation Commissioner v Environment Agency EA/2006/00 have been properly applied by the Commissioner. We accept and adopt the Commissioner’s factual matrix and reasoning in her Analysis at paragraphs 18 to 20 of the DN. The Appellant provides no evidence to undermine the Commissioner’s acceptance of the factual matrix described by the Commissioner to have pertained at the time of the request. It is clear to us that it was established, on the balance of probabilities, to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that Council, who are the Public Authority in this appeal, do not hold the disputed information. [9] Accordingly we dismiss the appeal. Brian Kennedy QC 21 August 2017 Promulgated 31 August 2017"

Signed Date: 13 June 2017 Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2016/0221 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Steve Sanders (the “Appellant”), against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 8 August 2016. It concerns a request for information made by the Appellant to the Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”) on 9 September 2014. 2. The request followed numerous previous requests for information made by the Appellant to the MoJ and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (“HMCTS”), relating to the handling of claims brought by him in the County Court. The Appellant had complained to the Commissioner about the MoJ’s handling of a number of these information requests. The Commissioner issued several decision notices and there have also been a number of appeals before the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) (“FTT”) against these decision notices. The Request for Information 3. The request giving rise to the present appeal (the “Request”), was contained in a wide-ranging letter from the Appellant to the MoJ on 9 September 2014. It was dealt with by the Commissioner as having been made on the following terms: “I note the Ministry of Justice issues guidance to other public authorities on compliance with the Freedom of Information and Data Protection Acts. Please provide copies of all such information and documentation. Kindly provide the name, email address and job title of the person you report to [in respect of the head of the MoJ’s Disclosure Team]. Kindly provide all information held as to your duties, responsibilities and remit as the MoJ’s Head of Disclosure [in respect of the head of the MoJ’s Disclosure Team]. Kindly inform of your salary and the length of time you have been employed by the MoJ and of any previous roles within the MoJ or U.K. Government [in respect of the head of the MoJ’s Disclosure Team]”. 4. The MoJ refused the Request, relying on section 14(1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), namely that the request was vexatious. The decision was maintained following an internal review. The Complaint to the Commissioner 5. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner under section 50 of FOIA. -3-6. The Commissioner considered representations made by the MoJ in connection with a previous complaint made by the Appellant, and decision notice (FS50558542), issued by the Commissioner in relation to that complaint. The Commissioner also considered the relevant case law, and the Commissioner’s own Guidance Note on vexatious requests, and found that the MoJ had correctly applied section 14(1), and that the Request was vexatious. 7. In reaching this decision, the Commissioner considered that the key question to ask when weighing up whether a request was vexatious is whether the request was likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. Where this is not clear, the impact on the authority should be considered and balanced against the purpose and value of the request, taking into account the background and history to the request. 8. The Commissioner regarded the first part of the Request (for copies of all guidance on data protection and freedom of information that the MoJ had issued to other authorities), to be unfocused, and considered that it could cover a large volume of information. The Commissioner considered that this request was less likely to have been regarded as vexatious had the Appellant focused on particular information. The remaining parts of the Request referred to the Head of the MoJ’s Disclosure Team. The Commissioner considered those parts of the Request could be described as harassing that staff member. 9. The Commissioner considered that the MoJ has been able to demonstrate that it has engaged with the Appellant’s correspondence over a number of years, to a significant extent, and that cumulatively, it has spent a significant amount of time and resources in dealing with his information requests, in addition to separate complaints and other correspondence from him. 10. On the basis of arguments put forward by the MoJ in connection with the previous complaint made by the Appellant (FS50558542), and the history of his previous information requests and encounters between the parties, the Commissioner considered that it was reasonable to conclude that the Appellant would continue to submit requests and/or have further contact with the MoJ regardless of any response provided to the Request. The Commissioner considered that it was clear that the Appellant was not satisfied with the MoJ and how it conducts itself. The Commissioner also considered that it was reasonable for the MoJ to be concerned that the Appellant would use the requested information in a disruptive way, by contacting the staff member whose information he had sought. The Commissioner was satisfied that in the context of the MoJ’s previous and ongoing dealings with the Appellant, complying with the request would result in a disproportionate burden on its resources. For all these reasons, the Commissioner was satisfied that the MOJ had correctly relied on section14(1) FOIA. The Appeal to the Tribunal 11. The Appellant has appealed against the decision notice. The MoJ has not been joined as a party to the appeal. The Appellant requested an oral -4-hearing. The Commissioner considered that an oral hearing was not necessary, and did not attend the hearing. 12. Prior to the hearing, we received a bundle of some 300 pages. We have considered all the documents before us, including those received from the parties subsequent to the hearing, even if not specifically referred to in this decision. 13. At the start of the hearing, we explained the procedure of the hearing to the Appellant. We also explained what the hearing was about (whether the Request was vexatious), and equally what it was not about (whether the MoJ or HMCTS had been guilty of any wrongdoings). We are satisfied that the Appellant has had an opportunity to fully put forward his case. Grounds of Appeal and the Commissioner’s Response 14. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal are extensive. They also set out in some detail his correspondence with the Commissioner’s office. In brief, we take the grounds of appeal to be that: <U+F0B7> the Commissioner deliberately ignored his actual complaint and the real issues; <U+F0B7> the Request (and his other requests dating back to October 2012) were not vexatious given the MoJ’s protracted failure to comply; <U+F0B7> the Commissioner’s lead case officer appeared to be biased; <U+F0B7> the Commissioner had little real understanding of the issues between the Appellant and the MoJ and was in no position, therefore, to decide that the Appellant’s requests are vexatious, and that the MoJ’s position is reasonable; <U+F0B7> the first part of the Request was not “unfocused”. The MoJ must already know and have readily available, the guidance it provides to other public authorities; and <U+F0B7> the Appellant was fully entitled to complain about the conduct of the MoJ employees whose details he had requested. 15. The Commissioner’s response to the notice of appeal is briefly as follows: <U+F0B7> other requests and issues between the parties have been addressed separately by the MoJ and in some cases, by the Commissioner and the FTT. The Appellant cannot attempt to reopen those matters in this appeal. The scope of this appeal is the information request made by the Appellant on 9 September 2014; <U+F0B7> although the Appellant has made many previous requests to the MoJ and remains dissatisfied with the responses he has received, on a number of occasions, he has referred complaints to the Commissioner and appealed to the FTT, and the MoJ’s responses have been largely upheld; -5-<U+F0B7> there is no evidence of actual or perceived bias on the part of the case officer involved in this case; <U+F0B7> there has been a long history of correspondence between the Appellant and the MoJ, some of which has been the subject of consideration by the Commissioner on previous occasions in the context of other information requests. The Commissioner therefore has a good understanding of the background to the Request and the context in which it was made. While it is relevant to take the background into account, it is not for the Commissioner, nor for the Tribunal to investigate or determine the substantive complaints made by the Appellant against the MoJ; <U+F0B7> the Commissioner was entitled to note that the scope of the request was extensive, seeking disclosure for a considerable amount of information, and to observe that a more focused request would have been less likely to be considered vexatious. However, this factor was not determinative because the Commissioner also took into account the context of the request and the history of the correspondence; and <U+F0B7> while the Appellant may complain about an individual if he chooses to do so, the requested information is not necessary to enable such a complaint to be made. 16. The Appellant has provided a reply to the Commissioner’s response which we have also considered. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 17. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal from a Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other Notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 18. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Decision Notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, as in this case, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. The Statutory Framework 19. Under section 1 of FOIA, any person who makes a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed if the public authority holds that information, and if it does, to be provided with that information. 20. The duty on a public authority to provide the information requested does not arise if the information sought is exempt under Part II of FOIA or if certain other provisions apply. In the present case, the MoJ has invoked section 14. -6-This section does not provide an exemption as such. Its effect is simply to render inapplicable the general right of access to information contained in section 1(1). Where section 14 applies, the public authority does not have to provide the information requested, nor indeed is it required to inform the requester if it holds the information. 21. Section 14 sets out two grounds on which a public authority may refuse a request. The first is where the request is vexatious. The second is where the request is identical or substantially similar to a previous request that the public authority has already complied with. The MoJ has relied on the first. 22. Specifically, section 14 provides as follows: (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious. (2) Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for information which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request. Evidence and Submissions 23. As already noted, the Commissioner did not attend the hearing. We have considered his position as set out in the decision notice and in the response to the notice of appeal, as summarised above. 24. We were concerned, however, that while the Commissioner had made reference to arguments made by the MoJ in relation to previous complaints made by the Appellant and had also made extensive reference to the previous dealings between the parties, he had not provided a full history about those matters. Bearing in mind that in CP v The Information Commissioner, the Upper Tribunal stated that: ""The high hurdle for satisfaction of the section 14(1) test requires an appropriately detailed evidential foundation before the Tribunal which addresses the course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority. This need not be compendious or exhaustive but must explain those dealings in sufficient detail and put them into context"" (para 2), the Commissioner was directed to provide further details of that history. 25. The Appellant, did not lodge a witness statement, but gave evidence and made submissions (albeit without distinguishing between the two), which we will refer to below, to the extent relevant. He also took us to various documents in the bundle. In addition, the panel asked him some questions. 26. In brief, the Appellant says that his letter of 9 September (containing the Request) was part of a longer letter which itself is part of ongoing correspondence between him and the MoJ. He says that the Request repeats his previous requests for information, particularly, as set out in his letters of 5 December 2012 and 11 March 2014, and that when he -7-complained to the Commissioner, it was in relation to all the previous requests as well. 27. By way of background, the Appellant says that between 2000 and 2005, he was involved with claims at the Barnet County Court in which he was seeking payment for work done as a musician/actor. He encountered problems at the court. He says that the court staff made it plain that they did not like dealing with a litigant in person. He had difficulty with one member of staff, in particular. He complained to the court manager, but was not satisfied with how that complaint was dealt with. He then explained the various further developments (including proceedings for defamation, and a strike out application, as well as an apology he received), which we do not need to set out in any detail here. 28. In relation to his various requests under FOIA, he says that in about 2008, he felt that his efforts to seek resolution by way of formal complaints was not yielding the desired result. He had written to various different people but there was no genuine effort to investigate his complaints, and so he then began to use the FOIA route to seek to obtain internal documents that tell the court staff what to do and what not to do, and also, information about the complaints handling procedure. 29. To better understand the dealings between the parties, we have considered the correspondence between them in the bundle, as well as the previous decision notices and FTT decisions, contained in the bundle, including in particular: <U+F0B7> Decision notice FS50498837, upheld on appeal EA/2013/0238; <U+F0B7> Decision notice FS5040688, upheld on appeal EA/2014/0243; <U+F0B7> Decision notice FS50552499, upheld on appeal EA/2015/0043; <U+F0B7> Decision notice FS50558542, upheld on appeal EA/2015/0068; and <U+F0B7> Decision notice FS50571695 substituted by the FTT’s consent order in appeal EA/2015/0228. It may be helpful if we briefly summarise this history. To the extent that some of the requests post-date the Request, we consider that they are still relevant to explain the nature of the dealings between the parties. 30. Decision notice FS50498837 dated 28 November 2013, concerns the Appellant’s request made to the MoJ on 3 February 2010. The request was for the complaints handling manual and standard phrases recommended for use by complaints handlers at Her Majesty’s Court Service (“HMCS”), now the HMCTS. The Appellant explained that the request was made for the purpose of deciding whether a named HMCS employee was deliberately breaching “your own rules and guidelines or whether your staff are instructed to misdirect and shift the focus of complaints whilst evading or rewriting what the complaint is actually about”. The MoJ relied on the exemptions in sections 31, 40 and 42. The decision notice records that the Appellant had asked for similar information on previous occasions and -8-referred, for example, to requests he had made on 12 July 2009, and on 10 January 2010. It also records that there had been protracted delays on the part of the MoJ in dealing with the Appellant’s request. For the reasons set out in the Decision Notice, the Commissioner required the MoJ to disclose part of the information, subject to certain redactions. The Commissioner also went on to consider whether the MoJ’s failures in dealing with the Appellant’s requests amounted to a criminal breach of FOIA under section 77 as alleged by the Appellant, but considered that there was no evidence to support such a finding. 31. The Appellant appealed to the FTT. In a decision dated 21 May 2014, the FTT noted that the Appellant had a long course of dealings with the MoJ during which he had made a number of complaints about how he had been treated by court staff and how those complaints had been handled. The FTT noted that the Appellant maintained that the MoJ had deliberately withheld the information requested and that the Commissioner should have exercised his powers under section 77 of FOIA, but noted that that was not a matter within the FTT’s jurisdiction. It dismissed the appeal. 32. Decision notice FS50540688 dated 4 September 2014 relates to the Appellant’s request for information in respect of court proceedings involving himself. The MoJ confirmed that it held some of the requested information but relied on various exemptions with respect to other aspects of the information. The Commissioner’s considered that the MoJ did not hold some of the requested information and that other information that was held, was subject to the exemption in section 40(1)(personal data) and issued a decision notice to that effect. 33. The Appellant appealed to the FTT. In a decision dated 7 July 2014, the FTT dismissed the appeal. The FTT noted the similarity between the request in the appeal before it and the request considered in EA/2013/0283 and considered that the Appellant bore a large responsibility for any claimed failure on the part of the Commissioner to differentiate between the subject matter of the two requests. It went on to say that even if it had sympathy with the Appellant’s complaint (which it stated it did not) it had no power to direct the Commissioner to reopen or broaden the scope of his investigation. 34. Decision Notice FS50552499 dated 14 January 2015, concerns a broad ranging request for information including all claims issued against HMCS and/or HMCS staff broken down as specified in the request. The Appellant also requested claims brought against the member of staff who he alleged had threatened him with “GBH and Serious and Violent Assault at Barnet County Court”. The Commissioner found that the MoJ had properly relied on the exemptions cited. 35. The Appellant’s appeal to the FTT was dismissed. The FTT noted the long history between the parties dating back to the Appellant’s original request for information made on 29 November 2010. The FTT considered that the Commissioner had failed to address part of the Appellant’s complaint and noted other shortcomings on the part of the Commissioner. The FTT allowed the appeal to this extent (although required no action to be taken -9-since by the time of the hearing, the matter was academic), but otherwise dismissed the appeal. 36. The decision notice in FS50558542 dated 27 January 2015, concerned the Appellant’s request for information relating to a customer service poster displayed in some courts. The MoJ refused the request relying on section 14(1). Based on its review of the history of dealings between the parties, the Commissioner was satisfied that the MoJ had correctly relied on section 14(1) and that the request was indeed vexatious. 37. The appeal to the FTT was dismissed. The FTT stated that it had looked carefully at the history of correspondence and exchanges between the parties, and it agreed with the Commissioner that the key question to be considered when weighing up whether the request was likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. The FTT agreed with the Commissioner’s assessment and conclusion in this regard. It also noted that the Appellant had made serious allegations of misconduct and matters that called into question the MoJ’s ability to deliver justice, but the FTT did not accept that the purpose or value of the request was directly related to those allegations, particularly in circumstances where the Appellant had made similar previous requests over a number of years. It also did not accept the Appellant’s assertion that the Commissioner had deliberately withheld documentation. 38. The decision notice in FS50571695 dated 10 September 2015 concerned three requests for information. In this case, the MoJ relied on section 17(6) (where the public authority has previously issued a refusal notice stating that it is relying on section 14). The Commissioner decided that the MoJ had correctly relied on section 17(6) and so was not obliged to respond to the information requests in issue. The Appellant appealed to the FTT. In the course of the appeal, the MoJ accepted that it had unintentionally misinformed the Commissioner which led to the issuing of a consent order by the FTT stating that the MoJ was not entitled to rely on section 17(6). 39. In response to the directions (see paragraph 24 above), the Commissioner has explained that: <U+F0B7> Excluding those complaints which resulted in the decision notices and Tribunal decisions referred to above, and the complaint which resulted in the present appeal, the Commissioner has received 14 separate complaints from the Appellant, regarding the MoJ under section 50 of FOIA between 24 May 2013 and 3 October 2016, and those complaints relate predominantly to HMCTS (previously HMCS) with one complaint in respect of the Judicial College. <U+F0B7> Apart from the decision notices referred to above, there were 4 further decision notices issued by the Commissioner under references FS50538007, FS50574778, FS50580354, and FS50648628. We note that in all 4 decision notices, the Commissioner dismissed the complaint. We also note that in the case of the requests covered by 2 of the decision notices, the MoJ relied on section 14, and that this was upheld by the Commissioner. - 10 -<U+F0B7> There has been an additional FTT decision on appeal by the Appellant from the decision notice FS50538007 concerning the request in respect of the Judicial College. The FTT struck out the appeal pursuant to Rule 8(3) of the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 as having no reasonable prospect of success (although the FTT stated that this did not imply any criticism of the Appellant but rather a misunderstanding on his part). Findings 40. The only issue in this appeal is whether the Request is vexatious. A number of other issues raised by the Appellant are not within this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. 41. FOIA does not define “vexatious”. However, the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) has offered guidance in three cases as to what the term means in the context of information requests – Information Commissioner v Devon County Council and Dransfield; Craven v Information Commissioner and Department of Energy and Climate Change, and Ainslie v Information Commissioner and Dorset County Council. 42. The three cases all concerned section 14(1) of FOIA and/or the corresponding provision under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The cases were heard by Judge Wikeley who treated Dransfield as the ‘lead case’ and set out helpful guidance on the meaning of “vexatious” which we have summarised below: <U+F0B7> “Vexatious” is a word that takes its meaning and flavour from its context. In the context of section 14, “vexatious” carries its ordinary and natural meaning, within the particular statutory context of FOIA. The dictionary definition of “vexatious” as “causing, tending or disposing to cause … annoyance, irritation, dissatisfaction or disappointment can only take us so far”. As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may well be vexatious, but it depends on the circumstances. <U+F0B7> “Vexatious” connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure”. Such misuse may be evidenced in different ways. <U+F0B7> The Commissioner’s guidance that “the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause provides a useful starting point so long as the emphasis is on the issue of justification (or not)”. <U+F0B7> The purpose of section 14 is to protect public authorities and their employees in their everyday business. Thus, consideration of the effect of a request on them is entirely justified. A single abusive and offensive request may well cause distress, and so be vexatious. A torrent of individually benign requests may well - 11 -cause disruption. However, it may be more difficult to construe a request which merely causes irritation, without more, as vexatious under section 14. <U+F0B7> An important aspect of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of whether or not there is an adequate or proper justification for the request. <U+F0B7> A common theme underpinning section 14(1) as it applies on the basis of a past course of dealings between a public authority and a particular requester, is a lack of proportionality. 43. He stressed that this guidance is not intended to be prescriptive. He went on to say that the question of whether a request is truly vexatious may be determined by considering four broad issues or themes: <U+F0B7> the burden on the public authority and its staff; <U+F0B7> the motive of the requester; <U+F0B7> the value or serious purpose of the request; and <U+F0B7> any harassment or distress caused to the staff. In paragraphs 29 to 45, he set out further guidance about each of these four themes. 44. The UT decisions in Craven and Dransfield were both upheld by the Court of Appeal (“CA”). The CA added that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public, or to any section of the public. It went on to say (at para 68), that “Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious”. 45. The CA went on to say that where a motive can be established, that may be evidence of vexatiousness, although if the request is aimed at disclosure of important information which ought to be publicly available, then even a “vengeful” request may not meet the test. 46. The UT revisited the issue of vexatious requests in CP (referred to at paragraph 24 above), on the question of whether the FTT had correctly given weight to the nature of the requests made and had conducted an appropriately rounded assessment in the light of the high hurdle required to satisfy section 14(1), and whether the evidential basis for the FTT’s decision was sufficiently clear. As already noted at paragraph 24 above, the UT stressed that the high hurdle for satisfaction of the section 14(1) test requires an appropriately detailed evidential foundation of the course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority. The UT also stressed that a compendious and exhaustive chronology exhibiting - 12 -numerous items of correspondence is not required, but there must be some evidence, particularly from the Commissioner, about the past course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority which also explains and contextualises them. The UT went on to say that a proper scrutiny of the number of previous FOIA requests requires more than a superficial count, and that section 14 should not be invoked without objective and careful justification. 47. We turn now to the facts of the present case, which for convenience, we will consider by reference to the UT’s 4 themes, namely the burden on the public authority and its staff; the motive of the requester; the value or serious purpose of the request; and any harassment or distress caused to the public authority’s staff. Burden 48. There is very limited evidence before us as to the burden that would be caused by the Request in particular. The Commissioner has said that the first part of the Request is unfocused. The Appellant disputes this, but there is no evidence specifically from the MoJ as to what complying with the request would involve. The Commissioner has been up-front in saying, in his decision notice, that he has relied on the MoJ’s arguments in connection with a different request, dealt with by the Commissioner under decision notice FS50558542. We have reservations about this approach. It seems to us that the Commissioner must consider each complaint on its own facts and though it may be appropriate to draw on the history of previous complaints, the evidence and arguments the Commissioner relies on should be set out in his decision notice without a general reference to submissions which may have been made with respect to a previous complaint. 49. Nevertheless, the Request must be seen in its totality, in the context of the Appellant’s previous and likely future requests. This is inkeeping with Judge Wikeley’s guidance in Dransfield (at paragraph 29): “First the present or future burden on the public authority may be inextricably linked with the previous course of dealings. Thus the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor.” 50. The evidence is that the Appellant has a longstanding grievance against the MoJ giving rise to numerous requests for information, lengthy correspondence, a large number of complaints to the Commissioner, and a number of appeals to the FTT. We note that with reference to the request dealt with in the decision notice FS50558542 in respect of which the MoJ relied on section 14(1), the MoJ expressed its concern about the large volumes of correspondence being received from the Appellant, and also expressed its concern that a response to that particular request would probably result in staff across the MoJ receiving e-mails from the Appellant, and those e-mails would place a burden on the MoJ’s administration. We - 13 -have had sight of some of the correspondence and requests for information, but not all of it. What we have seen leads us to find without hesitation, that the Appellants’ requests for information and related communications, are likely to have placed a considerable burden on the MoJ. Not only has the volume of correspondence been considerable, but it has been frequent, often lengthy and detailed, and also, it has often been overlapping in its nature and content. We have no doubt that the MoJ will have found the nature and extent of the correspondence difficult to manage and that dealing with the Appellant’s requests and related correspondence will have been very resource intensive. 51. As in Dransfield, the future burden must also be considered. The Commissioner says that if the Request is complied with, it will generate further requests and correspondence. Having considered the history, we consider it more than likely that the Appellant will continue to engage in extensive correspondence with the MoJ about the manner in which it has dealt with his various complaints, and that in all likelihood, it will lead to further protracted correspondence from the Appellants, which will create a further burden on the MoJ. 52. We also consider, putting it bluntly, that the Request is largely a fishing expedition. The Appellant is looking for something, perhaps anything, to justify and further his grievance against the MoJ. In principle, this itself does not offend against FOIA. However, given the volume of material potentially encompassed within the scope of the first part of the Request in particular, we are in little doubt that it will provide fruitful ground for further questions, further requests, and further correspondence. We are also in no doubt, that this would mean that the parties would be embroiled in further back and forth correspondence for months, if not years, to come. In short, we are satisfied that the future burden is likely to be considerable. 53. We have considered whether and to what extent the nature and volume of the requests and other correspondence about the Appellant’s grievance has been the result of failures on the part of the MoJ in its dealings with the Appellant’s. As Judge Wikeley pointed out in Dransfield (at paragraph 30): “… if the public authority in question has consistently failed to deal appropriately with earlier requests, that may well militate against ... a finding that the new request is vexatious”. 54. We accept that there have been failures on the part of the MoJ. Certain of its shortcomings, including delays, have been recorded in the decision notices and FTT decisions referred to above. We also accept that some of the Appellant’s requests may not have been answered and that he may have had to repeat them, However, that is a different matter from saying that the public authority has consistently failed to deal appropriately with earlier requests and is now simply complaining about the burden of dealing with the Request. We do not find, on the evidence before us, that that is the case. Motive, value and purpose - 14 -55. For convenience, we have considered these two themes together because on the facts of the present case, as indeed in Dransfield, the issues are closely intertwined. 56. The motive of the requester may well be a relevant and indeed a significant factor in assessing whether a request is vexatious. Judge Wikeley noted in Dransfield, at paragraph 34, that “the proper application of section 14 cannot side-step the question of the underlying rationale or justification for the request”. He pointed out that there is a balancing exercise to be undertaken. On the one hand, it is important that public authorities should not be exposed to the irresponsible use of FOIA. On the other hand, a single request may quite legitimately prompt a further request for more information and a series of requests may well be reasonable when viewed both individually and in context as a group. In other circumstances, a series of requests may suggest that later requests have become disproportionate to whatever the original inquiry was. He described this as “vexatiousness by drift”. As regards the value or serious purpose of the request in terms of the objective public interest in the information sought, Judge Wikeley noted that in some cases, the weight to be attached to that value or purpose may diminish over time and subsequent requests may not have a continuing justification. 57. In our view, “vexatiousness by drift” aptly describes the present case. The Appellant may well have legitimate concerns about the way in which he was dealt with by the HMCTS, although it is not within our jurisdiction to make any findings about that. What we do find is that the Appellants’ quest has become disproportionate to that original purpose. We find that he is seeking something, or indeed anything, to justify his grievance. 58. To the extent that the Appellants assert that in addition to his private interests, there is also a public interest involved to expose shortcomings and wrongdoings within a public body, we do not agree that that is the case here. As already noted, the Request is not targeted at any specific area of alleged wrongdoing. Rather, it is speculative, to see what he might find. Harassing or causing distress to the staff 59. In Dransfield, Judge Wikeley point out that although a finding of vexatiousness does not depend on there having been harassment or distress of the public authority’s staff, vexatiousness may be evidenced “…by obsessive conduct that harasses or distresses staff, uses intemperate language, makes wide-ranging and unsubstantiated allegations of criminal behaviour or is in any other respects extremely offensive…” 60. We note from the evidence before us, that the Appellant has accused the MoJ, at various times, of being cynical, dishonest, and fraudulent. He has alleged that the MoJ has been engaged in deliberate misrepresentation, criminal acts, perjury, a conspiracy to defraud and pervert the course of justice, persistent concealment, obstruction, dishonesty, mishandling of his complaints, deceit and lying. Some of these allegations have been directed at the MoJ generally, and others have been directed at specific individuals. He has also made various allegations against the Commissioner’s staff. - 15 -There is clearly a continuum to these allegations and several were repeated during the hearing. 61. We do not have any evidence before us, in this appeal, from any individual members of staff at the MoJ about the effect on them of such allegations. It might have been helpful to have had such evidence. Nevertheless, we consider that given the nature and frequency of the allegations, that they are likely to have been very distressing to the MoJ staff. We also find it likely that if the MOJ were to respond, the Appellant would not be satisfied, and that the allegations, and hence the harassment and distress, would continue. The fact that part of the Request was for details of individual staff members, also makes this likely. 62. For all these reasons, we are satisfied that the Request was properly characterised as vexatious. Accordingly, we uphold the Commissioner’s Decision Notice and dismiss this appeal. Other Points 63. The Appellant contends that the Commissioner deliberately ignored his actual complaint and the real issues. To the extent that the formulation of his Request (as set out at paragraph 3), is narrower in scope than the Appellant may have intended, we do not find that was as a result of any deliberate intent on the part of the Commissioner. The Appellant’s letter containing the request was wide ranging and not at all easy to follow. In any event, given our finding that the MoJ was correct to rely on section 14(1), if the Request was wider in scope, that is unlikely to support a different finding. Decision 64. This appeal is dismissed. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge Date: 13 June 2017 Promulgated 15 June 2017 - 16 -"
"22","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0305 Heard at Worcester On 24th. April, 2017 Tribunal Members Before Jean Nelson Judge and David Farrer Q.C. Gareth Jones Between Jeremy Geere Appellant and The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) Respondent Mr. Geere appeared in person. The ICO did not appear but made written submissions.Decision and Reasons The Decision Notice (“the DN”) was in accordance with the law. West Mercia Police (“WMP”) did not hold the requested information and thus complied with FOIA s.1. The appeal is dismissed. The Tribunal does not require WMP to take any further steps. 1. It is hard to see what interest, public or private, was served by the pursuit of this appeal. 2. The substantive law and procedural requirements for police searches are contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984 (“PACE”) and PACE Code B, for which PACE makes provision and which has been modified from time to time. Paragraph 9.1 of the 2013 PACE Code B requires that specified records of police searches be held in a “search register” to be maintained at “the sub- divisional or equivalent police station”. 3. On 13th. June, 2016, following earlier broadly similar requests, Mr. Geere made a request for information to WMP regarding records of searches, in the following terms - 1 Please provide the information requested below in relation to the sub – divisional or equivalent police station covering Droitwich – (Evidently, a reference to PACE Code B) 2 (Defined the period covered by the request, offering alternatives by reference to cost threshold and protection of personal data.) 3 (Requested the number of searches recorded in the search register, the times of searches and how many drew blanks.) 4 (Requested the breakdown of costs involved in providing this information.) Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 are summarised because the outcome of this appeal depends on the proper interpretation of paragraph 1 of the request. 4. On 5th. July, 2016 Mrs. Williams of the Information and Compliance Unit for WMP and Warwickshire Police replied, saying that WMP held no information within the scope of the request. That evidently meant that there were no search records relating to the specified area and period. She provided a website link in relation to Request 4 and that features no further in this appeal.5. On 8th. July, 2016 she further stated that all Worcestershire search records were held at Worcester Police Station. 6. On 26th. July, 2016, Mr. Geere sought an internal review of the decision relating to Request 1. Furthermore, he stated that, if the Droitwich records were indeed held in Worcester, then his request related to all Worcestershire records held in the Worcester Search Register. On 10th. August, 2016, WMP responded by maintaining its denial, making no reference to the geographical scope of the request nor to the highly offensive character of Mr. Geere’s email of the same date. On 12th. August, 2016 Mr. Geere complained to the ICO. 7. Further requests followed between September and December, 2016. They resulted in disclosure of the total number of searches recorded at Worcester for all relevant districts, broken down by local authority area and, in part, by smaller town, village or parish and covering the first half of 2016. This disclosure confirmed that there were no January search records for Droitwich. Mr. Geere told WMP that this information was required for the presentation of this appeal but the provision of the information rendered the appeal entirely unnecessary, even if Mr. Geere’s claim as to the interpretation of his original request was correct. A successful appeal could have no practical value and FOIA jurisprudence was unlikely to be enriched by our decision on the proper construction of the request. 8. The DN, dated 16th. November, 2016 upheld WMP’s denial and referred to the steps it had taken to respond to the request. It did not fully address the issue: - Was the request confined to searches in Droitwich or did it extend to all the districts whose records were held at Worcester ? 9. Mr Geere relied on the wording of paragraph 9.1 and the literal terms of his request – “Please provide the information requested below in relation to the sub – divisional or equivalent police station covering Droitwich”. That meant what it said – he wanted whatever the Worcester register contained. 10. The test for interpreting the scope of a request is, in our opinion, “How would the responding officer of the authority be expected to construe it, in all the circumstances of the request, including any previous history?”11. Here it may be assumed that she was familiar with the relevant requirements of Code B and would be aware that the Worcester register contained records relating to other parts of the county. 12. She would note that the only district referred to in the request was Droitwich. She could reasonably assume (as was evidently the case – see §§5 and 6 and his submission of 24th. April, 2017) that Mr. Geere was unaware, at the time of his request, that Droitwich search records formed just part of a register covering several districts. If his target was all Worcestershire search records or those for, say, South Worcestershire, there was no obvious reason to specify Droitwich. Droitwich police station, although previously due for closure, had been kept open for all but front - counter services, hence, from the standpoint of a local resident, could perfectly well be the sub – divisional or equivalent police station for the purposes of the Search Register records of Droitwich. 13. Finally, it emerged in evidence that this sequence of inquiries from Mr. Geere had sprung from an incident involving a firearm which occurred in Droitwich and led to a request for information dated 20th. May, 2016, also handled by Mrs. Williams of the Information Compliance Unit. 14. Taking account of those factors, we conclude that a reasonable respondent, armed with the information available to Mrs. Williams, would be expected, on a balance of probabilities, to understand the request of 13th. June, 2016 as confined to Droitwich searches, even though a literal interpretation would require a much more extensive investigation of records for a large part of the county. If Mr. Geere wanted a wider range of records, he might have been expected to make that clear or to have avoided a direct reference to Droitwich. 15. We bear well in mind the obligation to provide advice and assistance under s.16 of FOIA. We do not consider that the initial request was ambiguous or suggested a need for assistance. Its scope is what it sought when it was made, as to which we have made our finding. 16. However, the sensible course on receiving the first email of 26th. July, 2016, would have been immediately to widen the scope of the response to cover the whole Worcester register and to inform Mr. Geere that this was underway. This was done in due course by supplying the total number of records for South Worcestershire over a six month period and, later, breakingthem down as indicated at §7. This was done in December, 2016, after publication of the DN but well before the hearing of this appeal. 17. That being so, there was no useful purpose to be served by this appeal. 18. Not for the first time when evaluating the case of an appellant, we deplore the aggressive tone of some of Mr.Gere’s correspondence with WMP and his wholly unfounded accusation of dishonesty (Bundle p. 78 10/8/16). It was in marked contrast with the measured and courteous conduct of his oral appeal. 19. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 20. This is a unanimous decision. Signed David Farrer Q.C.

Except as set out above, the Commissioner’s Decision Notice shall remain in effect. Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Mr Stephen Baker (the “Appellant”), against a decision notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 8 March 2016. 2. The Appellant’s appeal concerns the response he received to the request for information made to Liverpool City Council (the “Council”), under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”). The request was in relation to a draft report about bus lanes and related correspondence. 3. The Appellant’s request relates to recommendations that certain bus lanes be removed and others be retained. The Appellant was concerned that the bus lanes that were recommended to be retained were selected on the basis of the revenue they generated from Penalty Charge Notices. The Request for Information 4. On 10 July 2015, the Appellant wrote to the Council and requested information on the following terms: (1) Please provide a suitably redacted copy of the draft report by Mott McDonald dated 5 September 2014 as referred to at page 5 here: http://councillors.liverpool.gov.uk/documents/s140386/Appendix%203 %20%20Mott%20McDonald%20Bus%20Lane%20Review%20Docume nts.pdf (2) Please provide suitably redacted copies of all correspondence between Liverpool City Council and Mott McDonald for the period 1st July 2014 to 31st December 2014. 5. In response to paragraph (1) of the Appellant’s request, the Council refused to provide the information, relying on the exceptions in regulation 12(5)(e) (adverse effect on the confidentiality of commercial information), and regulation 12(5)(f) (adverse effect on the interests of the person who provided the information). 6. In response to paragraph (2) of the Appellant’s request, the Council said that the information was not held. 7. At the Appellant’s request, the Council carried out an internal review, but maintained its position. The Complaint to the Commissioner 8. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner. -3-9. In relation to paragraph (1) of the request, the Commissioner considered that that while there might well be a case to be made for withholding the information under regulation 12(5)(e), the Council had not made out its case. As to regulation 12(5)(f), the Commissioner considered that the purpose of this exception was to protect the voluntary supply to public authorities of information that might not otherwise be made available to them. The Commissioner noted that Mott McDonald, the organisation commissioned to produce the report, was contractually obliged to provide it, and since the information had not been provided voluntarily, this exception was not engaged. Having found that neither exception was engaged, the Commissioner did not go on to consider the public interest factors. 10. The Commissioner required the Council to disclose the information coming within the scope of paragraph (1) of the Appellant’s request. 11. In relation to paragraph (2) of the request, the Commissioner asked the Council several questions. Based on the answers provided, the Commissioner was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the information was not held. The Appeal to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant has appealed to the Tribunal against the decision notice. The Council also appealed, but that appeal was later withdrawn. The Council is a party to the Appellant’s appeal. 13. After the appeal was lodged, but prior to the hearing, the Council informed the parties that in fact, it did hold information within the scope of paragraph (2) of the request. The Council then disclosed copies of that correspondence, although it said it was redacting the names and contact details of certain of its staff, as well as third parties, in particular, employees of Mott McDonald. The Council explained that these redactions were made on the basis of regulations 12(3) and 13 of the EIR (personal data). The Council further said that it considered that the individuals whose details were being redacted were not of such level of seniority or public exposure to be expected to be named or identified in any correspondence disclosed to the public. The Commissioner accepted this argument and invited the Tribunal to issue a substituted decision notice recording that the Council holds information coming within the scope of paragraph 2 of the Appellant’s request, and that the information redacted comprises personal data that is exempt under regulation 13 of the EIR. 14. The Appellant did not accept that all the redactions amounted to personal data. He also pointed out that while e mail correspondence had been provided, several of the e-mails referred to attachments which had not been provided, and that the Council claimed that it did not hold those attachments. He disputed the Council’s assertion that those attachments were not held. Having consulted Mr Colin Thomas, a retired IT specialist, the Appellant argued that there had to be serious doubts as to whether any IT data storage programme could be -4-configured so as to exclude links to any attachments. He also argued that it was reasonable to assume that the person(s) to whom an e-mail with an attachment was addressed, would have downloaded such an attachment. He further pointed out that when he had sent an e mail to the Council to request the attachments, it had taken the Council only six minutes to reply, and he argued that in that very short period of time, they could not have established that none of the attachments had been retained in any form. In addition, the Appellant argued that even if the Council did not itself hold copies of the attachments on its own systems, it could approach Mott McDonald to supply copies of the attachments because Mott McDonald held the documents comprising those attachments on the Council’s behalf. 15. The Appellant went on to quote from the Council’s data retention policy and argued that the Council’s position was inconsistent with its own policy. He was not satisfied that the Council had exhausted all options in its attempts to supply documentation pursuant to his information request, and requested that there be an oral hearing so that these issues could be properly examined. There was no further response from the Council. 16. Prior to the hearing, we were provided with an open bundle of documents, and a separate closed bundle. The closed bundle contains unredacted copies of the e-mail correspondence between the Council and Mott McDonald. 17. Following the hearing, we received a number of further items of evidence and submissions, in response to directions made, although some material submitted by the Appellant has been outside the scope of those directions. The Appellant also requested that the Tribunal issue directions that would allow both him and the Commissioner to put questions to the Council which should be answered with witness statements from the relevant people, and further invited the Tribunal to consider whether it should reconvene the hearing. We consider it would be disproportionate to accede to the Appellant’s request. The hearing concluded with limited issues to be dealt with by way of further directions. Although it took some time (until December) for these issues to be dealt with, that was largely because of delays in seeking voluntary production from other parties. The Appeal Hearing 18. The Commissioner did not attend the hearing, but relied on written submissions. The Appellant attended in person and represented himself. He gave evidence and called Mr Colin Thomas as an expert witness. 19. Mr Michael Jones attended on behalf of the Council. He is the Deputy Head of Democratic Services and Information Manager for the Council, a role which encompasses responsibility for oversight and compliance with information requests. It was intended that only Mr James Penter would give evidence on behalf of the Council. Mr Penter is a Senior Platform Architect for the Council whose responsibilities include the -5-design, implementation and support of the Council’s ICT infrastructure, including e-mail communication platforms, data storage, data retention and back-up, server management and related technologies. In the event, it became clear during the hearing that there were certain matters on which Mr Jones was best placed to answer questions from the Appellant and the panel, so he, too, gave evidence on certain points. 20. At the start of the hearing, we pointed out to the Council that having reviewed the 73 pages of e mails in the bundle (covering the period 16 July 2014 to 7 November 2014) between various individuals at Mott McDonald and various individuals at the Council, it seemed that certain redactions did not appear to relate to any personal data, but included, for example, the Council’s business address and the address of Mott McDonald. In addition, the redactions from the correspondence were inconsistent. For example, the names of senders and recipients had been redacted in some cases, but not in all. Phone numbers had also been redacted in some, but not in all cases. Mr Jones explained that he had recently taken over conduct of this matter at the Council, and that having considered the redactions, the Council was now prepared to disclose the e mail correspondence in their entirety, without any redactions. This was done on 23 September 2016, following the hearing. 21. It is of course regrettable that the e mails referred to in paragraph 13 were not located sooner. It is also regrettable that the unredacted e mails were not provided to the Appellant prior to the hearing. However, the fact that these issue were addressed and conceded early in the hearing meant that the oral evidence could focus on the remaining issues. 22. Mr Thomas adopted his witness statement. In brief, he says that since 1987, he has been an IT specialist in Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service. He notes that within six minutes of the Appellant’s e-mail dated 24 June, Mr Jones replied to say that “… the e-mails retained and disclosed where (sic) NOT retained with any attachments at all in any form”. Mr Thomas said that he has considerable experience in the way computer systems store and back up information and cannot accept Mr Jones’s statement. In his experience, if Mr Jones’ statement was true, then the Council’s data retention policy and computer systems must be an almost unique, bespoke design, and he believes that this is extremely unlikely. He went on to set out a series of questions which he considered needed to be answered in order better to understand how it was possible for the Council to store e-mail text while destroying attachments to the same. 23. Mr Penter gave evidence as to why the Council could not provide the e- mail attachments, and some additional clarification was provided by Mr Jones. Mr Baker, supported by Mr Thomas, cross-examined them. In brief, Mr Penter explained that because of data capacity constraints, the Council requires staff to take positive steps to retain any attachments to e-mails; otherwise, they are automatically deleted after -6-90 days. The Council backs up its whole database, including e-mails less than 90 days old. This is intended to allow for recovery in the event of a major IT failure. All data backed up is held for 30 days, after which, it is overwritten. 24. As to how the Council had been able to ascertain in just six minutes that no attachments had been saved, Mr Jones explained that in fact, the checks had already been carried out before the Appellant’s e mail of 24 June. In total, Mr Jones had asked 27 different individuals to check whether they had saved any of the attachments, and he had personally undertaken checks to verify that the attachments had not in fact been saved. It was through that process that the e-mails (albeit without attachments), had been identified. 25. As regards paragraph (1) of the Appellant’s request, Mr Jones explained that the Appellant had been provided with the only version of the report which the Council held, and that this was the final, rather than the draft report. Mr Baker pointed out that the Council’s letter to the Commissioner dated 24 February 2016 and reproduced at page 71 of the open bundle, purports to enclose a copy of the report “referred to in point [one] of Mr Baker’s request”. He queried how it is that the Commissioner could have been provided with a document which the Council now says it had not retained. In response, Mr Jones maintained that that was the final version of the report, but undertook to provide the Appellant, following the hearing, with exactly the same document it had provided to the Commissioner on 24 February. We understand that the Council did so on 23 September 2016. Mr Jones also undertook to try to obtain any other versions of the report that may have been retained by Mott MacDonald. 26. In submissions, Mr Baker argued that to the extent that the information he had requested was not physically held by the Council, the Council could obtain it from Mott McDonald who should be taken to hold it on behalf of the Council. He referred, in this regard, to the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50118044. In that case, the complainant had requested copies of the responses given to a market research exercise undertaken by Swift Research Limited (“Swift”) on behalf of Leeds City Council (“Leeds”). The Council had taken the position that it did not hold the requested information, but the Commissioner had found that the information was held by Swift on behalf of the Council. Having considered the decision, we drew the parties’ attention to the basis for the Commissioner’s findings (at paragraphs 45 and 46 of the decision notice, in particular), which concerned the terms of the contractual arrangements between Swift and Leeds. We asked Mr Jones what the contractual arrangements were between the Council and Mott McDonald, and in particular, whether those contractual arrangements might shed light on the question as to whether Mott McDonald could be said to hold the information on behalf of the Council. Mr Jones said he did not know. 27. However, Mr Jones said he would make enquiries both of Mott McDonald as well as third parties who might hold the documents which -7-comprised attachments to the e mails to see if they would provide them to the Council voluntarily. If so, the Council would provide them to the Appellant. Mr Jones stated that the Council’s position now was that any such information should freely be provided to the Appellant, and that it would not be seeking to rely on any exceptions, whether those relied on previously, nor any others. 28. Following the hearing, Mr Jones informed the Tribunal and the Appellant, in a series of e-mails, as to his efforts to obtain that information from a number of different parties. After a number of efforts on his part, and extensions of time granted by the Tribunal, he informed the Tribunal that he had been unsuccessful in those attempts. Subsequent directions were made for Mr Jones to clarify the contractual relationship (if any) between the Council and Mott MacDonald. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 29. Regulation 18 of the EIR provides that the enforcement and appeals provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) shall apply for the purposes of the EIR (save for the modifications set out in the EIR). 30. Under section 58(1) of FOIA, if the Tribunal considers that a Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, if the Tribunal considers that he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 31. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. Statutory Framework 32. The EIR implements Council Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. There is no dispute that the information requested in the present case constitutes “environmental information” as defined in regulation 2(1), and therefore comes within the scope of the EIR. 33. A public authority which holds environmental information must make it available on request (regulation 5(1)). It must make the information available as soon as possible, and no later than 20 days after receiving the request. 34. Under regulation 12(1), a public authority may refuse to disclose information in certain circumstances. In the present case, the public -8-authority has said that it has provided all the information coming within the scope of the Appellant’s request that it holds. The Council says, in effect, that it has complied with the request, even if it had not done so at the time of the Commissioner’s decision. The only issue before us is whether the Council has in fact provided all such information as it holds. Findings 35. As already noted, since the Appellant’s appeal was lodged, there have been developments which impact the scope of this appeal. 36. First, the Council has disclosed to the Appellant a copy of the report he requested in paragraph (1) of his request. Although the Council says that this is the final report and not a draft report, we are satisfied that the Council has disclosed the only version of the report it holds. There is no basis to find that it holds any other version. 37. Second, the Council has also said that contrary to what it had previously asserted, it does in fact hold e mails coming within the scope of paragraph 2 of the Appellant’s request. These, too, have now been disclosed. 38. The only information in issue is now the attachments to the e mails. The Council maintains that the e-mails retained and disclosed were not retained with any attachments; otherwise they would have been disclosed. 39. We are satisfied with the explanations given as to why the Council does not hold (and at the time of its response to the Appellant’s request, did not hold), on its own servers, the attachments to the e mails. The Council’s evidence in this regard though surprising in some respects, is nevertheless credible. There was nothing of concern that emerged, in cross examination, nor in response to our questions. We make no findings as to whether the Council’s data retention policy is appropriate. That is a matter outside the scope of our jurisdiction. 40. We note that the Appellant appears no longer to challenge the Council’s evidence that it does not hold the attachments, nor to dispute that the Council has now provided him with all the information coming within the scope of his request that it has in its possession. What the Appellant says, is that information comprising the e mail attachments, if held by Mott MacDonald, is held by them on behalf of the Council. 41. This issue was not addressed in any detail during the course of the hearing. As already noted, Mr Jones said he was not aware of the contractual terms between the Council and Mott MacDonald that might shed light on the issue. However, he would try to obtain voluntarily, any such information held by Mott MacDonald and other parties. We have seen the e mail communications following the hearing which show not only that Mr Jones made these efforts, but that he did so repeatedly, albeit eventually without success. -9-42. It therefore falls to us now to decide if any information that may be held by Mott MacDonald within the scope of the Appellant’s request is held by it on behalf of the Council. 43. A public authority is required to give access only to information which it holds. Under regulation 3(2), information is held by a public authority if it is held by another person on behalf of the authority. FOIA, which applies to information other than environmental information, contains an equivalent provision (section 3). In effect, a public authority cannot evade the requirement to comply with a request for information just because its information is held by a party who is not a public authority, and therefore not subject to the EIR or FOIA. 44. To the extent that Mott MacDonald holds some or all of the information comprising the e mail attachments in issue, does it hold that on behalf of the Council? 45. We have considered the evidence and submissions on this issue that have been lodged after the oral hearing. 46. We have also been referred to the Commissioner’s guidance document on Outsourcing and Freedom of Information. While not binding on the Tribunal, the analysis it offers is helpful. We have also considered the separate guidance on Information Held by a Public Authority for the Purposes of the EIR. As this explains, there are several circumstances in which information may be held by another person on behalf of a public authority and therefore held by the public authority for the purposes of the EIR, including, of relevance here, where information is held by a third party as a result of contractual arrangements. In such cases, the contract may indicate whether the information is held on behalf of the public authority. The guidance gives the example of a contractual relationship in which the following provision applied to a market research project: “Leeds City Council and its authorised officers will have the right to inspect hard and soft copy data at any time during the contract period. Thereafter, and when the contract is spent, all hard and soft copy data must be given over to the council, with no copy remaining – electronic or paper – external to the council. The council has full ownership of the data...” This is the case referred to at paragraph 26 above, and as noted there, the Commissioner decided that data generated by the contractor was held on behalf of Leeds City Council. 47. In the present case, however, the relevant contract (dated 18 May 2012) is not between Mott MacDonald and the Council, but between Mott MacDonald and Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (“Merseytravel”). The explanation provided by the Council, which we have no reason not to accept, is that Merseytravel is the executive arm of the Integrated Transport Authority for Merseyside with responsibility for a range of transport functions, and is part of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, a local government body in its own right. The Council, together with other Merseyside councils, are constituent - 10 -members of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority but are distinct from it. As such, we are satisfied that even if under the contract between Mott MacDonald and Merseytravel, the information is held by Mott MacDonald on behalf of Merseytravel, it does not follow that the information is held on behalf of the Council. The appellant’s appeal must, therefore, fail on this issue. Decision 48. This appeal is allowed to the extent set out in the Substituted Decision Notice, but for all the reasons set out above, we do not require the Council to take any further steps. 49. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Date: 20 April 2017 Anisa Dhanji Judge - 11 -"
"24","Substantive Refusal","| — First-tier Tribunal | (General Regulatory Chamber) | Information Rights | | | | Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0136 Heard at Fleetbank House, London | On 23rd. March, 2017 Before Judge David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Members Pieter de Waal © and | Narendra Makanji | | Between _ | The Right Honourable The Lord Naseby (“Lord N”) | Appellant — and | The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) First Respondent | and The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (“The FCO”) Second RespondentLord Naseby appeared in person. | Christopher Knight appeared for the ICO. Julian Blake appeared for the FCO. | | _ Decision and Reasons | The Tribunal finds that the exemption provided by s.27(1)(a) was engaged and that the | balance of public interests favoured the withholding of the disputed information. The appeal is therefore dismissed. 1. For many years up to 2009, Sri Lanka suffered a devastating civil war involving Tamil rebels (the “Tamil Tigers” or “the LTTE”) controlling large areas in the North and East of the country and the armed forces of the majority Sinhalese government. 2. The final months from January to May, 2009, leading to the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, were particularly terrible. Many thousands of civilians in the Tamil - occupied areas were killed. | Who killed them and in what circumstances remains a bitterly disputed question to this day. It is clear from the material placed before us that the answers are not necessarily straightforward. For some years the Sri Lankan government of President Rajapaksa did not cooperate in an independent investigation into these questions and UK relations with Sri Lanka were injured as a result. a | 3. In March, 2014, with the support of a new administration in Sri Lanka, the United Nations Human Rights Council (‘UNHRC”) passed a resolution calling for an international investigation into allegations of violations of human rights and of international law by both sides in the conflict. It also called for progress on a reconciliation between the previous _ combatants, respect for human rights and a political settlement. It called upon the government of Sri Lanka to cooperate with the investigation and to take a range of other steps to discover | what had occurred and to hold those responsible to account. a 4. The Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (“OISL”), produced in response to that _ resolution, was published in September, 2015. Its findings were highly critical of the actions of the Sri Lankan security forces and associated paramilitary groups in the last few months ofthe wat. It stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that they were implicated in | widespread unlawful killings of Tamil civilians. Their actions might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. There were numerous allegations that senior government officials had ordered killings and “disappearances”. 5. The LTTE were also accused of killing people of all ethnic groups and religions who appeared to dissent from their views. They had indiscriminately bombed and mined civilians and targeted particularly political figures, public officials and academics. 6. OJSL described further atrocities and apparent war crimes by both sides but suggested that | government forces were still more extensively involved than the LTTE. It is not necessary to go into further detail in this judgment but it is perfectly clear that these were terrible events and that there is a very powerful public interest in identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Moreover, reconciliation may well depend on publicizing the truth. 7. Lord Naseby had a lengthy and distinguished career as an MP before becoming a member of | the Upper House. He was Chairman of Ways and Means from 1992 - 1997. He founded the All - Party Sri Lanka Group in 1975 and was Chairman for many years until 2015, when he became President. This interest reflected his earlier background, living and working in Pakistan, India and Sr Lanka in the 1950s and 60s. He claims, with every justification, a deep understanding of the culture, history and politics of Sri Lanka, based on many years’ visits, close relationships with important and influential individuals within the country and regular meetings with people of all ethnic groups within Sri Lankan society. 8. He is evidently a knowledgeable, fair - minded and disinterested observer of events in a country for which he has a deep affection. He is not convinced that OISL uncovered the whole truth as to responsibility for the events of early 2009, although open to a change of mind, should further disclosures support the OISL conclusions. In support of his case, he | exhibited an “Expert Military Report” by Major General John Holmes, dated March, 2015, prepared for the Sri Lankan Commission for Missing Persons, which cast doubt on significant | aspects of the OISL 9. Colonel Anton Gash was military attache to the British High Commission in Colombo for a number of years, including the period covered by OISL and some substantial time on either side of it. His duty in 2009 was to provide expert military on - the - spot reports and .assessments of the conflict to the South Asia Desk of the FCO and insights into the thinking of both sides. . 10. Some of his sources of information would be the local media. Sometimes political gossip. | | More important was the information obtained from local military or political contacts within the Sri Lankan administration who were prepared to give him briefings or simply pass on allegations on a confidential basis, circulation being restricted to his contacts in the FCO. The value of such information was a matter for his assessment. 11. The development of such a network of contacts is an essential part of work of the kind undertaken by Colonel Gash and other military attaches around the world. The fact that UK relations with the Rajapaksa government were fragile would not preclude the maintenance of such productive links. : The Request | | | 12. On 6th. November, 2014 Lord Naseby addressed to the FCO a request for - “Details of the despatches written by Colonel Anton Gash, the defence attache of the ‘British High Commission in Sri Lanka, to the UK F oreign Office during the period January, 2009 to May, 2009. These despatches described his assessment of what he had seen during this period of the Sri Lankan civil war”. 13. On 5th. January, 2015, the FCO provided heavily redacted copies of those email despatches. It justified its refusal to provide the redacted passages by reference to a number of FOIA exemptions, including s.27(1)(a) and (b) and s.27(2), which relate to prejudice to international relations and the protection of confidential information from foreign states or international organisations. The Tribunal does not need to look beyond 5.27(1)(a). given matters that have | been agreed and its own factual findings. 14. Lord Naseby sought an internal review which maintained the partial refusal of information. Lord Naseby complained to the ICO. | | 15. Some further emails were uncovered and were provided to him, subject to similar redaction. Other redactions were removed because the s.27(1)(b) exemption no longer applied.The Decision Notice (“the DN”) dated 4th. May, 2016. | 16. The ICO concluded that the FCO had probably located all the information within the scope of the request. He found that disclosure of redacted information provided in confidence would | | be likely to cause real and substantial prejudice to UK channels of communication with the | Sri Lankan regime and a wider loss of confidence in the UK’s use of confidential intelligence. 17. He readily acknowledged the public interest in a full understanding of what had taken place | in 2009. Nevertheless, it was clearly outweighed by the need to protect good relations with friendly states and the continuing flow of authoritative information which Colonel Gash and | his counterparts elsewhere provided. He ordered the FCO to disclose some further information for which other exemptions had been claimed and which is immaterial to this appeal. | 18. Lord Naseby appealed. | The Appeal 19. Although the grounds of appeal may imply that the engagement of s.27(1)(a) was unchallenged, the further submissions and the course of the hearing make it essential that the Tribunal make findings as to the engagement of s.27(1)(a) and, if it is engaged, whether this is a case of prejudice proved on a balance of probabilities or the likelihood of prejudice. The appeal case as to the balance of public interests was very clearly stated. 20. Lord Naseby’s case was set out in his Grounds of Appeal, his Reply to the Responses and a skeleton argument. He detailed his impressive credentials as an authority on the modern history of Sri Lanka. 21. He provided a helpful summary of the historical background to the long - running conflict between the government and the LTTE. He described the period from January to mid - May, 2009 as absolutely key to an understanding of the contemporary situation. The UN had concentrated on this final phase when initially taking evidence for the Darusman report. The Sri Lankan government had refused to cooperate and the evidence was therefore largely | confined to what was said by LTTE survivors, NGOs and the media. The report had beenrejected by the government, which nevertheless delayed setting up its own independent inquiry until August, 2013. It was to this inquiry, led by Maxwell Paranagama, that Major | General Holmes provided his expertise (see §8). His report was exhibited to Lord Naseby’s | submissions. | 22. Lord Naseby knew Colonel Gash well and had met him in Sri Lanka. He regarded him as a first - rate source of information and objective evaluation, an assessment with which the FCO fully agreed. He argued that the risks involved in disclosure of Colonel Gash’s reports were 7 not comparable to similar publication relating to Saudi Arabia or Iran, examples referred to _ by the FCO. Sri Lanka is a friendly democratic member of the Commonwealth. Disclosures _ relating to those other states posed very different problems. There was no solid ground for fearing damage to relations with the current Sri Lankan administration if the despatches were fully published. | 23. Partial disclosure of these despatches had not damaged relations and it is not clear that the redacted material is fundamentally different in character. 24. As to the public interest, the high importance of reaching the truth as to what occurred was common ground. The value of OISL had been compromised by the refusal of the Rajapaksa government to cooperate, because it regarded the civil war as an internal matter. As with earlier inquiries, the result was a report unduly dependent on LTTE evidence. Colonel Gash was an ideal source of carefully evaluated information from the other side, enabling the public to form a balanced judgement on what had taken place. | 25. It is vital that the truth as to these events is revealed. 26. The Paranagama report represents a well - informed alternative view to that of OISL. It demonstrated the importance of obtaining credible evidence from the government side, when assessing the accuracy of the OISL findings. 27. Suitably redacted so as to protect vulnerable individuals, the full content of the Gash despatches would be an invaluable contribution to the revelation of what truly occurred. The balance of public interests firmly favours disclosure. |28. The large Sri Lankan population within the UK had a particularly powerful interest in gaining a clear and full picture of the events of 2009. 29. No UK security interests were at risk through disclosure. 30. Release of the emails could reduce the risk of prosecutions for war crimes. 31. The FCO had made no attempt to consult the Sri Lankan authorities and discover whether they objected to disclosure. 32. Lord Naseby reinforced his submissions with extensive relevant documentary evidence, | including the Holmes opinion, ministerial statements and extracts from Hansard. 33. In response, the ICO and the FCO adopted broadly similar positions, though Mr. Knight for the ICO probed the evidence of Ms. Clarke ( see §35 ) with great care. 34. As to the engagement of s.27(1)(a), the FCO stressed a specific and a more general consequence of disclosure. As to the former, the change of government in Sri Lanka had produced an administration more sympathetic to the UK than its predecessor. Nevertheless, disclosure of material provided to Colonel Gash on a strictly confidential basis would seriously damage that administration’s trust in the UK as a recipient of such information. More widely - and perhaps still more significantly - it would send a very unwelcome message to other friendly governments which allowed information to reach the FCO by such channels in the expectation that it would go no further. | | 35. Ms. Laura Clarke, the head of the South Asia desk, giving evidence on these issues quoted Colonel Gash and his successor in Sri Lanka, both very experienced diplomats whom she had : consulted on the consequences of disclosure. The Tribunal regards their views as highly — significant and quotes them in full. | 36. Colonel Gash observed - | “T believe the Tribunal should take into account that I have also requested that a number of redactions should stand. As the author Iam undoubtedly best-placed to make a holistic assessment of the impact on individuals, organisations and relationships.”I am particularly concerned about the impact on individuals with the UN, who gave me information that they were not authorised to release. Additionally there is huge potential for this issue to undermine the credibility and trustworthiness of the entire UK Defence Attaché network, if host nations see that even briefings which were | given to DAs ona strictly confidential classification will subsequently be disclosed, and if allies see that their personal and confidential opinions and assessments are released.” | 37 Captain Stuart Borland (UK Non-resident Defence Advisor for Sri Lanka) stated: | “Without this mechanism [close personal relationships with contacts within the military and the government] I would not be able to function as a DA in either India or Sri Lanka or probably any other country. I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship between me as the DA and the military and Government in Sri Lanka would dry up and revert to official releases only. I suspect that this would also extend to my FCO colleagues and the High Commissioner would find himself similarly frozen out. We might as well close up and Just operate a consulate in this case. | | More importantly, I also suspect that most other Governments would see what the UK has done and channel and contacts would dry up in other countries. Would we really expect the Indians to trust me in conversation once our activities in Sri Lanka were laid open. They would worry that the same might happen to them. And there are some key countries where this communication channel is the most effective if not the only one.”’ 38 Ms. Clarke, who has a wide experience of such channels of communication, gave ~ evidence as to recent relations with the different Sri Lankan administrations and strongly confirmed the above opinions. She explained that some parts of the despatches related information which had not come from a confidential source or was now common knowledge. The surviving redactions withheld confidential material from informed sources 7 or comments from Colonel Gash which were plainly never intended for publication. In discriminating between the disclosable and the confidential, Ms. Clarke’s FCO team had 7 “gone through the despatches with a toothcomb” and had disclosed everything which could be revealed without damage to UK interests. 39 Ms. Clarke gave evidence briefly in closed session. We refer to it in the closed annex to | this decision. The only significant matter which was disclosed had already been | communicated to Lord Naseby on terms, express or implied, as to confidentiality and he was therefore, most unusually, present when it was referred to in the absence of the public and _therefore able to comment on this evidence in his closing submissions. (He did not do so, in fact). The Tribunal’s findings The law , 40 Section 27(1)(a) of FOIA provides — “(i) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice — | - | | (a) Relations between the United Kingdom and any other state, “ This is an exemption to which FOIA s.2(2)(b) applies, hence, if engaged, the Tribunal must assess the balance of public interests in disclosure and maintaining the exemption. 41‘ The exemption is engaged if it is more probable than not that some identified prejudice will result or if there is a significant and weighty risk of such prejudice from disclosure The degree of risk may well be relevant to the balance of public interests (see R (Lord) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWHC2073 {Admin.] [2011] I Info L.R.239), | 42 When assessing the strength of evidence from a department of state such as the FCO as to the likely reaction of foreign governments, the court must be alive to the individual | expertise of senior staff, such as Ms. Clarke, and the institutional knowledge on which they can draw. Such authoritative opinions are to be contrasted with the probable absence of any judicial knowledge of such matters ~— see R (Lord Carlisle of Berriew v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] UKSC 60 [2015] A.C. 945. That does not require a slavish subservience to the expert opinion but it does mean that the Tribunal needs a very clear | justification for rejecting it and preferring its own assessment. 43 Our first task is to identify the prejudice which, it is said, may result from disclosure. Although, initially, it seemed that the FCO was largely concerned with the specific prejudice to UK relations with Sri Lanka, that is the Sri Lankan government’s loss of trust following what it perceived as a major breach of confidence, it was clear at the hearing that still wider damage was contemplated, namely, a general loss of confidence in the discretion of the UK government, leading to the closing of confidential channels of communication by many friendly states, within or without the Commonwealth. The quotations from the opinions of Colonel Gash and Captain Borland at §§33 and 34 are compelling evidence to that effect. |Aa Given those assessments, coupled with the evidence of Ms. Clarke, which we found highly persuasive, we conclude that disclosure of the redacted passages in the despatches | would, on a balance of probabilities, undermine not only the trust of the Sri Lankan administration but of foreign governments more generally in the FCO’s respect for the confidentiality attaching to information provided off the record to UK defence attaches and perhaps other UK diplomats. That would amount to serious prejudice to the interests of HM Government. | 45 We accept that the disclosed material was carefully reviewed and very probably came from non — sensitive sources. That is, inevitably, a generalised finding because the Tribunal is not equipped to form its own independent view, in relation to most of the redactions, as to the likely source of any disclosed information. | | 46 The public interest in disclosure is substantial. Beyond the general interest in | transparency as to events of such importance, there is the likely value of information from Colonel Gash’s contacts with the security forces to any balanced assessment of the responsibility of both sides to the carnage of the last months of the war. There is evidently a perception, shared by a body of informed opinion, that reports so far published have been devalued by the shortage of evidence and appraisal from the government side, largely due to a reluctance to participate in what was seen as an intrusion into Sri Lanka’s internal affairs. Furthermore, Lord Naseby submits, the public interest would be served by the publication of Colonel Gash’s authoritative comments and assessments, where they occur. 47 We acknowledge the strength of the public interest in such information from such sources, marshalled by such a well qualified and objective observer. Nevertheless, we consider the-public interest in maintaining confidential channels of communication for UK | defence attaches clearly outweighs it. Our finding that prejudice would, rather than would be likely to, result from disclosure is a significant factor supporting that assessment. 48 That finding, as related to the balancing of public interests, is not dependent on the view _ we formed as to the effect on specific relations with Sri Lanka but is founded also, to a most significant degree, on our conviction that disclosure would inflict much wider prejudice on UK sources of information from confidential contacts in other countries.49 For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 50 This decision is unanimous. | Signed David Farrer Q.C. | | | Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 18th.

"25","Procedural Refusal",": IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50602104 Dated: 8 September 2016 Appellant: Lester Dibbin Respondent: The Information Commissioner Heard on the papers: Alfred Place, London Date of Hearing: 22 March 2017 Before Chris Hughes Judge and Steve Shaw and Dave Sivers Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 12 April 2017 Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 8 September 2016 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in these proceedings was formerly a councillor serving on Shaftesbury Town Council (“STC”). In 2012 concerns were expressed by staff as to his conduct and advice was sought from the HR department of the District Council for the area (North Dorset “NDDC”). A NDDC HR official (Bobbie Bragg) attended a meeting of the HR Committee of STC in 2012 at which the staff presented their complaint. 2. The Appellant has contested the various allegations made against him. Over time he became aware of the involvement of the NDDC official in this meeting and sought details of it from the Town Council and then from the District Council. Following correspondence he wrote to NDDC on 6 and 13 August 2015 (the two requests extend over two pages of the decision notice but for clarity are summarised in this decision). The first request asked for information about relevant meetings between STC and NDDC by reference to an email from a STC councillor (which was incorporated in the text of the request to NDDC and which advised him what to request from STC). The second contained much material which made complaints and sought advice or concerned STC rather than NDDC. 3. NDDC replied to the request of 6 August on 11 August stating its understanding of and response to the request:- “… my understanding of the information you are seeking is as follows:- A document relating to staff report to Bobbie Bragg relating to Lester Dibbin 8 Oct 2012, that contains allegations of harassment; Records of any meetings relating to such document; Evidence provided by the Council in relation to that document; 2Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 Meeting notes of the Council’s Human Resources unit relating to a matter identified as “lovegrove report” I am informed that none of the above notes, records or documents have been identified as being information within the Council’s possession. So far as I understand them, the other matters you refer to appear to seek opinions or explanations from the Council; as such they do not fall within the scope of a FOIA request” 4. On 13 August he specifically asked:- “1. As I do not wish to bring NDDC officers into what appears to be the fabrication of evidence, distribution of my personal data held by STC, and promulgating attacks on my integrity without my knowledge or following the proper established procedures. Q Did any NDDC officer attend the NDDC HR/STC meeting referred to by STC? Q Did [name of officer redacted] or any other HR personnel from NDDC play any part in this matter. 2. There is no evidence NDDC actually were involved as it is reported below, they have no documents. Q Please confirm STC are making false claims about NDDC involvement? Q Have NDDC destroyed the records relating to the alleged meetings referred to? Q If so why have documents referring to a criminal act and containing personal data on me, been destroyed? ….. [name of correspondent redacted] it would be a lot easier if NDDC would make a clear statement on its involvement, either yes we were involved, or no we were not. I would then be able to concentrate on STC but while they continue to substantiate their claims based on what they say is NDDC advice that is not possible.” 5. On 13 August 2015 the Assistant Chief Executive of NDDC responded summarising that council’s position:- “This matter has been being addressed for some time through the FOI process, and from what you say, appears to have gone through the review process. If you remain 3Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 dissatisfied about the response you have received, you will need to go to the ICO. Your FOI requests relate to Council records and proper responses have been given to your requests. To the extent that you want further information, replies, even if possible, would require individual members of staff to attempt to recall events from some while ago. As this will inevitably be unreliable, even if people have any recollection; it would not be right to attempt this. It is, of course, not a requirement of the FOI Act in any event.” 6. The Appellant complained to the ICO. After an exchange of emails the ICO confirmed (bundle page 98 email of 24 November 2015), that the scope of the ICO investigation was the information request of 6 August 2015 and whether NDDC were correct in responding that information was not held. In the course of the ICO’s investigation a solicitor for NDDC interviewed Bobbie Bragg who confirmed that she had attended a meeting at the STC at the request of the STC Town Clerk. She had not prepared any report for that meeting, she had not prepared any report or notes of the meeting and “she has now confirmed that she does not hold any such documents at all (and even though it is now nearly four years ago she does not recall keeping any such documents even for a limited period of time)” (letter NDDC to ICO7 July 2016 bundle page 121-122). 7. In his decision notice (DN) the ICO considered whether the information sought was held and considered the information provided by Ms Bragg (DN paragraphs 24-28) and noted that:- “The issue was essentially an internal matter within Shaftesbury Town Council, and was an informal meeting and so there was no requirement for her to take notes or record the advice for the business purposes of the District Council.” 8. The ICO (DN paragraphs 29 -30) concluded that the issue was a matter relating to STC, while Ms Bragg’s expertise was relevant to the issue there was no reason for her to have retained any information given that it was not NDDC business. He concluded on the basis of the evidence and assurances he had received that no information within the scope of the request was held. 9. In his grounds of appeal the Appellant criticised delays by all three public bodies (STC, NDDC and the ICO) in dealing with his complaints and requests, the numbers of individuals involved in handling his complaints, the conduct of STC in not making 4Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 a formal record of meetings when he had been informed that there were records of meetings, that the ICO had not received documents which the Appellant knew existed, in particular:- “The Complaint, Three HR sets of minutes, the complete Bobby Bragg report, please note that there are a further 24 pages, this document was claimed to be confidential to NDDC by STC, it clearly was not if it is true NDDC did not have it” 10. He also criticised the failure of the ICO to criticise the public authorities, the failure of the ICO to recognise the harm done to him and his family by what had occurred. 11. In response the ICO maintained the position set out in the DN. The ICO maintained that it was more likely than not that no information was held. The ICO distinguished between issues relating to whether STC had properly prepared minutes of its meetings and whether NDDC held any such records of the STC meetings. The ICO reviewed the evidence of the NDDC officer concerning the meeting, the assurances from NDDC that no records were held and stated that the “facts upon which the Appellant relies in support of his appeal provide no or no adequate evidence that further documentation falling within the scope of the request is held by the Council” (paragraph 18 page 6). The ICO accepted the good faith of the Council in confirming the searches it had carried out and that it did not hold the information. The ICO noted that the appeal was against the DN relating to NDDC and there was no evidence that NDDC held the complaint by STC staff and minutes of the STC HR committee which were STC documents. 12. The ICO noted that the redacted report supplied by STC to the Appellant “Staff Report to Bobbie Bragg” which the Appellant relied upon to assert that NDDC held more material referred to the extensive notes of a STC HR committee with the Appellant (bundle page 131). It provided no evidence that NDDC held such notes. Consideration 13. Throughout the history of this appeal there has been a conflation by the Appellant of documents which may be held by STC with those held by NDDC. He has been confused as to what documents are or should be held by NDDC. The situation is however clear. NDDC has very limited functions with respect to town councils in its areas. It is however not unusual for district councils to provide a modest amount of support to town councils when requested so to do. In this case STC was having 5Appeal No: EA/2016/0242 difficulties between one of its councillors, the Appellant, and staff members. The only evidence of involvement in the issue is the involvement of Bobbie Bragg. Her recollection, some years after the event, was considered by the ICO in concluding that NDDC did not hold the recorded information sought. She was clear that she had met the staff team at STC (NDDC internal email 25 June 2015 bundle page 136, letter NDDC to ICO bundle page 121-122) and had not kept notes of the meeting. The tribunal is satisfied that this is highly probable. She had been brought in as part of the informal support district councils give to town councils, she had no continuing role, it did not relate to her responsibilities to NDDC, she referred the staff to their council’s own procedures (bundle page 136) and departed. There was no NDDC business reason for her to keep records of the meeting or keep or create any documents. 14. The Appellant has produced no evidence to support his argument that the ICO was incorrect. The tribunal is satisfied that the decision notice was correct in law and dismisses the appeal. 15.

The appeal is dismissed. 5 REASONS Background to Appeal 2. The Appellant made a request to Dorset County Council (“the Council”) for the identity of a party who purchased land from the Council. The Appellant is concerned that the Council did not have the legal power to dispose of this land. 10 3. The Council disclosed some information in response stated that further information was not held. The Appellant complains that the Council has not provided the information that he requested. 4. The Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50611729 on 12 September 2016, in which it was held that the Council had provided all relevant information which it held. 15 The Respondent required no further steps to be taken by the Council. Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 30 October 2016 relied on grounds of appeal that the information provided by the Council was misleading because it referred to the wrong parcel of land. The Appellant referred to the existence of other 20 Council records concerning the decision to dispose of the land in 1990, which had not been provided but which he submitted would answer his information request. He therefore submitted that further information is held by the Council and should be disclosed. 6. The Respondent’s Response dated 5 December 2016 maintained the analysis as 25 set out in the Decision Notice. 7. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 52 pages, 30 including submissions made by both parties, for which we were grateful. The Law 8. S. 1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) provides that a person making a request for information is entitled to be informed by the public authority whether it holds the information and, if so, to have it communicated. 35 9. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: 2“If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in 5 accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could 10 have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 15 10. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. Conclusion 20 11. The Decision Notice records at paragraph 14 the information provided to the Respondent by the Council, including details of the records searches it had undertaken (see pages 28 and 40 of our bundle) for the identity of the person to whom the land was disposed. The Appellant asserts that the Council must have a record of the name of an individual or individuals who acquired the land but has provided no evidence to 25 support his assertion. 12. The Council states that its records show the land transaction as being with “The Talbot Marriage Settlement” and that it holds no further information within the scope of the request. It has offered the Appellant access to its records and referred him to a historical archive. 30 13. There does seem to have been some confusion in the Council’s records as to whether the land disposed of for no consideration or leased for £800. There is also some confusion about the date of disposal. The Council attempted to clear up the confusion and, as the Council disclosed its records in respect of both possible transactions (see page 14 of the bundle), the confusion did not affect the conclusions 35 of the Decision Notice. 14. The Appellant’s request was “who acquired field 5165.62…when it was disposed of by the Council as part of the Talbot Settlement”. We understand the disposal to which he refers to have taken place in 1993 or 1994. As such, we regard the further Council documents referred to by the Appellant and apparently created in 40 1990 to fall outside the scope of the particular request with which this appeal is concerned. It would of course be open to the Appellant to make a fresh request for the information from 1990. 315. Our suspicion is that the land in question was acquired by the trustees of a private trust. This would explain why an individual person is not named in the Council’s records. A search of the Land Register would presumably confirm whether the land is now held by the successor trustees, and that is a matter the Appellant may 5 wish to investigate. 16. Be that as it may, the Respondent concluded on the balance of probabilities that the Council had disclosed all information falling within the scope of the request. She did so in reliance upon the evidence provided by the Council, which the Commissioner preferred to the bare assertions made by the Appellant. 10 17. We are not persuaded that the Respondent’s Decision Notice was wrong in its conclusions and, in all the circumstances, we now dismiss this appeal.

The appeal is dismissed. | 2, On the Appellant’s application, the Tribunal directs pursuant to rule 14 (1) (b) and rule 2 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) / | Rules 2009 that the Appellant shall be referred to only as X in this Decision. / REASONS Background to Appeal | | 3. X made information requests to the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames | (“the Council”) on 14 April and 6 May 2016 in the following terms: | “Under the FOI request, please send me a copy of | 1. The internal policy and procedure staff at the London Borough of | | Richmond Upon Thames Adult and Community Services Mental Health should | use to carry out a Care Act 2014 Assessment | | | | 2.

Under the FOI please send me a copy of the council procedures to investigate allegations of abuse by staff inflicted in vulnerable adults at risk of abuse by staff”. | 4. X also made a request under the Data Protection Act 1998, with which we are not concerned in this appeal. | 5. The Council refused the information requests in reliance upon s. 14 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) on 13 May 2016. X complained to the | Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) the same day, but the Commissioner advised X to await the outcome of an internal review. The internal review confirmed the Council’s reliance upon s. 14 (1) FOIA and the Commissioner investigated X’s complaint thereafter. 2: | 6. The Respondent issued Decision Notice F 550629339 on 31 August 2016, | | upholding the Council’s decision. It recorded that the Appellant has made 28 information requests to the Council over the previous three years, all of which had been responded to, and that a link to the Safeguarding policy requested had been provided to X on six occasions. 7. Ihe Decision Notice explained that in the context of the Council’s own complaints policy, it now considers X to be “vexatious”, in having pursued complaints against the Council dating back to 1995. It also recorded that X’S allegations had not been upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, who had | investigated them in 2006, 2011, 2014 and 2015 and had declined to become involved any further. Also, that X had been unsuccessful in litigation against the Council in the High Court. , 8. The Decision Notice recorded at paragraph 19 that the Council had applied s. 14 (1) FOIA to X’s previous requests in 2013 and that X had not appealed that decision. The Council had responded to the receipt of further requests but had then “warned” X in February 2016 that it was considering applying s. 14 (1) to future requests. This it did when the requests referred to above were submitted. 9. The Decision Notice concluded that, based on a detailed chronology of requests provided by the Council, the Commissioner was satisfied that X’s requests related to a long-running dispute with the Council. in which X had repeatedly asked for information which had already been disclosed. The Decision Notice noted that X’s complaints had been investigated by the appropriate agencies but not upheld and concluded that X’s requests took up significant resources and time in X’s effort to re- open a dispute in which the Council had been found not to be at fault. This situation served to deprive the requests of serious purpose or value for the wider public. although it was recognised that these matters are important to X. The Decision Notice concluded that X’s requests constituted a mis-use of F OFA in all the circumstances. and the Commissioner was satisfied that the Council was correct to apply s. 14 (1) : FOIA to the requests detailed above. | Appeal to the Tribunal | 10. X’s Notice of Appeal dated 28 September 2016 submitted that disclosure of the policies requested was necessary in order to found a case for judicial review against the Council. X submitted that there was “no evidence” and “no creditable evidence” of disruption or distress to the Council arising from these requests and that the Council had unlawfully treated the requests as vexatious because of X’s status under , the Council’s own complaints policy. X wished to cross examine Council staff about | this. X submitted that the Decision Notice was wrong to uphold the Council’s L | approach because there was a serious purpose to the requests, and they were in the L _ public interest. L 11. The Commissioner’s Response dated 8 November 2016 maintained the analysis as | set out in the Decision Notice. It referred the Tribunal to comments made by the Local E Government Ombudsman about the repetitive nature of X’s correspondence with the LL Council. The Commissioner noted that the Council had designated X as vexatious : | under its own complaints procedure in 2010, which was five years after the S | correspondence began. | o 12. X requested an oral hearing, which the Commissioner did not attend. The Commissioner asked the Tribunal to take her written submissions into account. The | LD Tribunal heard X’s oral submissions over the course of a morning. We acknowledge LD that X found the hearing difficult and at times distressing but we thank X for L persevering with it and setting out the basis of the appeal so clearly. The Tribunal had / before it a bundle comprising nearly 200 pages. At the hearing, X handed up one : further document which was a letter from the Council dated 7 February 2017 apologising to X for failing to properly record X’s needs and provide X with a support , | plan, an apology apparently instigated by the Local Government Ombudsman. | 13. X told the Tribunal about suffering from a serious mental health condition which X believes is connected to the Council's historical conduct. X stated that this | disability is recognised under the Equality Act 2010 so that x is entitled to reasonable : adjustments. X did not provide any evidence of a formal diagnosis to the Tribunal or | suggest that any particular adjustments were required to facilitate the hearing of the appeal but, having regard to the overriding objective, the Tribunal (a) agreed to X'S request for anonymity (see paragraph 23 below); (b) arranged for X to have a dedicated quiet waiting room at Field House (which was not in fact used because X arrived late, having become confused about a change of venue); (C) allowed X to sit | wherever they wanted in the hearing room and (d) adopted a facilitative and informal | approach to the hearing. offering breaks (which were not taken) and encouraging X to | take their time to make their best possible case. We note that the Tribunal office had | also taken steps to assist X by providing hard copies of all the pre-hearing ! correspondence although it was unable to grant X’s request to appoint an intermediary to assist with the appeal. | 14. X had filed a witness statement dated 10 January 2017. This asserted that the information request should be treated as genuine and not vexatious as it was relevant to an application for pre-action disclosure in connection with Judicial Review proceedings. X stated that it was a requirement of the Administrative Court to show that X had requested voluntary disclosure by the Council before seeking an order for disclosure and that FOIA was an appropriate route to take in this context. The witness statement also complained of a breach of Article 14 ECHR by both the Council and the Commissioner and suggests that the Commissioner was required to issue a Safeguarding Alert once it became aware of the circumstances of X’s case. It also complained that the Council had disclosed its policies by providing a link to a website and the link had not worked. The witness statement suggested that the Commissioner was wrong to rely on the Council’s chronology as she should have required “hard evidence” to be produced. 1s. The Tribunal explained to X that it found the written documents X had produced | prior to the hearing difficult to follow because X had “cut and pasted” other peoples’ documents into them and it was not clear whether X was adopting these statements or including them only so as to provide a further commentary on them. In those 4circumstances, the Tribunal took X through the Grounds of Appeal, the Response and the witness statement, asking X to clarify their case in relation to each. | 16. During the hearing, X’s case expanded beyond what had previously been put in 7 writing. In particular, X submitted that the Commissioner was wrong to have accepted the Council’s chronology of previous requests by X as accurate as this was disputed evidence which X had not been given the opportunity to challenge. X Suggested that the Commissioner’s staff had made their lives easjer by simply accepting and rubber stamping the Council’s case. Further, that the Commissioner should not have considered the history of X’s dealings with the Council and status _ under its complaints policy. X also told the Tribunal that the Commissioner had discriminated against X in the Decision Notice by failing to take into account the fact that X had a mental disorder which affects their behaviour. X referred to the “inequality of arms” between themselves and the Commissioner, as the Commissioner has a lawyer, and suggested that the Commissioner’s staff had been unhelpful to X during the investigation. | 17. The Tribunal explained to X that the grounds of appeal did not state that the chronology was disputed, so the Commissioner could not have known this. X said that the Commissioner should have asked about this as X hadn’t seen the Council’s chronology. The Tribunal showed X the page in the bundle where the Council had sent the chronology to X. When asked by the Tribunal what parts of the chronology | | were disputed, X said that “some of the information is probably incorrect”. X said that these were not repeated requests for the same information as a fresh request for the new policy had been made only after the law had been changed. X disputed that repetitive requests were made. When the Tribunal took X to an example of an apparently repeated request, X said that it was permitted to ask for information again if the request was not answered in 20 days. When shown an example of where X had apparently not waited 20 days (requests numbered 30 and 31 on page 117 of the bundle) X said that probably this was due to stress about the Judicial Review proceedings and the need to demonstrate that an informal request for disclosure had been made. X also said that sometimes a request was made again to be more specific. | | 18. X told the Tribunal that the application for permission to bring Judicial Review | proceedings had been refused but that permission to appeal had been given. X said | that the refusal had been X’s lawyer’s fault for making the application out of time and ; that X was now self- representing for the appeal. | . C The Law . | 19. S. 14 FOIA provides as follows: | c “14. Vexatious or repeated requests | (1) Section I (1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious”. | 20. In Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 L AAC, the Upper Tribunal interpreted “vexatious requests” as being manifestly Lunjustified, or involving inappropriate or Improper use of a formal procedure. The Upper Tribunal considered four broad criteria for assessing whether a request was | L | vexatious, namely (i) the burden imposed by the request on the public authority and | its staff; (ii) the motive of the requester, (iii) the value or serious purpose of the LE request and (iv) whether there is harassment of or distress to the public authority's : staff. The Upper Tribunal stressed the importance of taking a holistic approach. The L Upper Tribunal’s approach was broadly endorsed by the Court of Appeal in its | decision (reported at [2015] EWCA Civ 454), emphasising the need for a decision | ~ maker to consider “all the relevant circumstances”. | L 21. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, | as follows: | | | “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - } (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or | (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the | Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, | the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal | shall dismiss the appeal. | On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which | the notice in question was based.” > We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with X. Conclusion , | 23. In determining X’s request for anonymity, the Tribunal had regard to rules 14(1) (b) and 2 of its Rules (referred to at paragraph 2 above). X told the Tribunal that it would cause stress and anxiety for X’s name to be made public and that it would affect X’s conduct of the appeal. The Tribunal decided that the hearing should be held in public but that it would be fair and just to anonymise X in the Tribunal’s Decision so as to ensure that A was able to participate fully in the proceedings without worrying about being identified. It is important for X to understand that | anonymity may not be granted in any further hearings before this Tribunal as each ~ panel will make its own decision on that matter. | 54 We note that the Council “warned” X about its possible future reliance on s. 14 FOIA prior to the decision which gave rise to this appeal. We are puzzled by the legal status of this “warning” and we hope it is helpful if we draw the parties’ attention to s. 617 (5S) and (6) of FOIA in respect of the permissible treatment of a pattern of | vexatious requests. | , | | 25. We note here the Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal’s emphasis on the need to take a holistic approach to any request in respect of which s. 14 FOIA has been applied. That approach has a particular resonance in X’s case for several reasons, which we consider below. | | 26. Firstly, as noted above, the Council provided to X and to the Commissioner a | | chronology of X’s information requests dating back to 2005 and the Commissioner proceeded to rely on it for the purposes of the Decision Notice. In any case where the | history of the requester’s dealings with the public authority is clearly disputed, we take the view that the Commissioner’s staff would need to take steps to satisfy themselves of the accuracy of a chronology provided by the public authority, for | example, by sampling the documentary evidence on which any disputed entries are based. In this case, we find that the accuracy of the chronology was not Clearly put in _ issue by X until the oral hearing. Despite having been provided with the chronology at an early stage and having made extensive submissions in writing, X did not inform | the Commissioner’s staff that the Council’s history as set out in the chronology was disputed. When asked by the Tribunal to explain how it’s accuracy was disputed, X did not have a clear submission to make, initially denying that it had ever been provided and then submitting that the Commissioner’s staff should have raised the issue. 27. Whilst we recognise that X is a litigant in person and has additional needs and whilst also being careful not to suggest that X should have made a forensic analysis of the chronology, we do consider it relevant that no challenge to accuracy was made until the hearing itself. This indicates that the accuracy of the Council’s account of the history of X°s requests was not uppermost in X’s mind when appealing the Decision Notice. In circumstances where the accuracy of the history of dealings | between the parties is not raised by the Appellant as a matter of factual dispute and | there is no other reason to doubt it, we conclude that it is both reasonable and — : proportionate for the Commissioner to rely on a chronology provided by the public authority without examining the underlying documentary evidence on which it is : based. | 28. In X’s case, we conclude that the Commissioner was entitled to rely on the | : Council’s chronology as part of “all the relevant circumstances” in reaching her : conclusion because (a) she was aware that it had been provided to X: (b) there was no L challenge by X to its factual accuracy in the Grounds of Appeal; and (c) it was | | supported by the Council’s submissions and other documentary evidence, for example | from the Local Government Ombudsman. We record here that we were also not | persuaded by the other matters raised by X for the first time at the hearing, namely the L allegations of discrimination and unfair treatment by the Commissioner. We note that L the Council was required to make a written apology to her in February 2017, but this , post-dates the requests made in this appeal and relates to a separate matter so this did L not affect our Decision. | E29. Secondly, X asserted that the Commissioner was wrong to take into account X’S | status as vexatious under the Council’s complaints policy. Whilst agreeing with X L that the Council’s own policy and its reliance on s. 14 FOIA involve different tests, L | we can find no indication in the Decision Notice that the two processes were L conflated. We consider that it was appropriate for the Decision Notice to take into L a account X’s status under the Council’s complaints policy when considering the case - holistically. That is not of course to say that X’s status in relation to complaints is , / determinative of the Council’s case for applying s. 14 FOIA, as each requires a / different approach. L 30. Thirdly, X submitted that the conduct of a requester with a mental health condition should be assessed differently in the context of s. 14 FOIA than the conduct L of other requesters, because their particular behavioural difficulties should be taken E into account. We consider that there may be some force in this argument because L “considering all the relevant circumstances” of a case might well require a decision maker to refer to such matters, for example where requests are repeated due to forgetfulness attributable to a medical condition. However, in X’s case the evidence : was that if requests were repeated (which was not accepted) it may have been due to anxiety about the prospects of other litigation, or in order to clarify them. In the absence of any medical evidence as to the nature of X’s disorder or the effect it might : have on X’s behaviour, we do not consider that the Commissioner was wrong to proceed in this case on the basis that the indicators of vexatiousness should be | considered in the same way for X as for any other requester. 31. Turning to the indicators of vexatiousness in this case, the Decision Notice finds | at paragraph 22 that X’s requests relate to a long-running dispute with the Council, that many of the requests are repetitious in nature, and that X has continued to ask for | information already provided. We have already found that the Commissioner was | entitled to rely on the Council’s submissions and chronology in reaching this conclusion. The Decision Notice also refers at paragraph 23 to the investigation of -X’s complaints by independent bodies and findings that the Council was not at fault. In these circumstances, the Decision Notice found that X’s motive in making these requests was to seek to sustain dialogue with the Council about matters which have been concluded and that the requests are likely to continue because X is mis-using the FOIA regime for a purpose which is not one of serious value to the public. X’s own submissions to the Tribunal confirmed that the purpose of making these requests was to continue with litigation against the Council. | 32. The Decision Notice concludes at paragraph 27 that the Council has already dedicated significant resources to X's past requests and that responding to the requests in this appeal would cause disproportionate and unjustified levels of disruption, ‘rritation and distress to the Council. | | | 33. In all the circumstances, and having considered X’s case carefully, we find no error in the Decision Notice’s approach to the issues. The conclusions reached in the ) Decision Notice are conclusions which we reach ourselves taking into account the | history of the matter and the ‘indicators of vexatiousness. We agree with the ‘Information Commissioner that X’s requests were manifestly unjustified, and 8involved the inappropriate use of a formal procedure. In all the circumstances we agree that the Council’s reliance on s. 14 (1) FOIA was appropriate. 34. This appeal is accordingly dismissed.

The Appellant appeared in person. The Respondent did not attend. © CROWN COPYRIGHT 2017DECISION 1. The appeal is dismissed. 5 REASONS Background to Appeal 2. The Appellant made a request to Post Office Limited on 17 May 2016, in the following terms: “I would be grateful if you could send me the lists of Agents and Company who 10 hold contracts; the list should show all their names, postal addresses and email addresses”. 3. The Appellant’s request was made in the context of his expressed concern that Post Office Limited may have appointed as its Agents/Sub Post Managers in London a disproportionately high number of people of Asian origin. He initially asked for 15 information about the ethnicity of staff employed in agency Post Office branches and, when this was refused, asked for the above details so that he could contact the Agents himself and ask for details of their employment practices and equal opportunities policies. 4. Post Office Limited refused the information request in reliance upon s. 40 (2) of 20 the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It explained its view that the details requested constituted personal data and that disclosing them to the Appellant would breach the first data protection principle. 5. The Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50639662 on 10 November 2016, upholding Post Office Limited’s decision. The Decision Notice concluded that the 25 information requested was personal data because it related to living individuals who were identifiable from it. She noted that many Agents live and work at the same address. She concluded that the data subjects had a reasonable expectation that their details would not be disclosed, that disclosure would have an unjustified adverse effect on them, and that the Appellant’s case for disclosure in the public interest was 30 not sufficiently compelling to outweigh the privacy rights of those concerned. Appeal to the Tribunal 6. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 6 December 2016 explained his concern that Post Office Limited was not monitoring the practices of its Agents. He confirmed that he did not request disclosure of personal addresses. 35 7. The Respondent’s Response dated 18 January 2017 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. It explained that it had invited the Appellant to withdraw his appeal but that he had not done so. It commented that the Appellant had not, in his Grounds of Appeal, disputed that the information requested constituted 2personal data but had suggested that there was an overriding public interest in disclosure. The Respondent asked the Tribunal to consider that (a) there are less intrusive means of demonstrating any supposed failure of Post Office Limited to operate fairly and (b) that there was no guarantee that the Appellant’s plan to write to 5 all agents would provide him with the information he sought. The Respondent was satisfied that disclosure would be likely to cause distress to the individuals concerned and asked the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal. 8. The Appellant requested an oral hearing of his appeal. The Respondent did not attend but asked the Tribunal to rely on her written submissions. The Tribunal 10 considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 108 pages, including submissions made by both parties, for which we were grateful. We were also grateful to the Appellant for his clear oral submissions and helpful summary, handed up at the hearing. The Appellant made clear to the Tribunal his concern about Post Office Limited’s agents. He explained that, as a former public servant, he felt strongly that 15 the agents should be subject to the same rules as if the post offices were in public ownership. He found it surprising that each post office was not itself a public authority for the purposes of FOIA. He had obtained details of the ethnicity of post office agents on a UK-wide basis, but was concerned to establish the situation in London as his own impression was that there was a problem there. 20 The Law 9. The duty of a public authority to disclose requested information is set out in s.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The exemptions to this duty are referred to in section 2 (2) as follows: “In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any 25 provision of Part II, section 1 (1) (b) does not apply if or to the extent that – (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 30 10. The exemption upheld in the Decision Notice in this case is s. 40 (2) FOIA. Were it engaged, this provides an absolute exemption falling under s. 2 (2) (a). 11. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: 35 “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or 40 (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 3the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. 5 On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 12. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of 10 discretion rests with the Appellant. Conclusion 13. We acknowledge that the Appellant has a genuine interest in establishing whether Post Office Limited’s agents are operating fair employment practices. In his oral submissions, he very fairly accepted that this particular request was very broad in 15 scope and included a request for personal data. We note that he has subsequently made more narrowly-worded information requests. 14. The Appellant did not attempt to persuade us that there was any error of law in the Decision Notice which is the subject of this appeal. We have not identified any errors of law for ourselves. In the circumstances, this appeal is dismissed. 20 (Signed) ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 23 March 2017 PRINCIPAL JUDGE 25 4"
"29","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2016/0081 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN RODERICK LUBBOCK Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD Second Respondent Heard at Field House in London: 28th September 2016 and at Fox Court in London: 20 December 2016. Date of Decision: 6th February 2017. Before Brian Kennedy QC Paul Taylor Anne Chafer DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the Decision Notice dated 3 March 2016 and dismisses the appeal:REASONS: Introduction: [1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice dated 3 March 2016 (reference FS50606866), which is a matter of public record. The Public Authority concerned is the University of Oxford (“ the University”). [2] The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat at Field House, London on 28th Sep- tember 2016 but the Tribunal were unable to conclude the hearing and issued Direc- tions on the 29th September 2016. The Tribunal reconvened at Fox Court, London on 20 December 2016. Factual Background to this Appeal: [3] Full details of the background to this appeal, Mr. Lubbock’s request for informa- tion and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice and not re- peated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether Mr. Lubbock’s request was vexatious. History and Chronology: [4] 4 Sept 2015 Request for all university communications referencing ice hockey 2 Oct 2015 University refuses request, citing s14 (1) 2 Oct 2015 Request for internal review 15 Dec 2015 Request again refused 12 Jan 2016 Complaint to the CommissionerRelevant Law: [5] Section 14 Vexatious or repeated requests (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for in- formation if the request is vexatious. (2) Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for informa- tion which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subse- quent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a rea- sonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request. Commissioner’s Decision Notice: [6] The University explained that there has been a private dispute between the Ox- ford University Sports Federation (the department of the University that oversees student sports clubs) (“OUSF”) and the Oxford Ice Hockey Trust (a team and club that is independent to the University)(“the Trust”). The requested information relates broadly to that dispute. [7] The University stated that it had attempted to resolve this dispute in various ways. However, since March 2013 it had received 15 FoIA requests from various in- dividuals known to be associated with the Trust. Ten were complied with, and five were refused on the grounds of vexatiousness. Evidence was received by the Com- missioner showing the scale of the effort required to comply with these requests (es- timating approximately sixty hours and requiring consultation with twenty-three indi- viduals), as well as the unreasonable persistence and at times openly hostile attitude of requesters. [8] Regarding the subject matter of the requests themselves, the University states that backdrop of the requests is a private dispute between the University and former athletes that is of no interest to the wider public. It characterised the totality of therequests as a “scatter gun” attempt to open up a “second front” of the dispute. The Commissioner accepted this argument, noting that even if the request were complied with, the dispute would continue. Therefore, whilst considering the Appellant’s re- quest not to be vexatious per se, it forms part of a series of requests that are in their entirety vexatious. Grounds of Appeal: [9] Mr. Lubbock put forward three grounds of appeal: i) Inaccurate Characterisation of the Background to the Request The instant request was made on behalf of the Trust, which has no dispute with the OUSF; rather, it has lodged a formal complaint with the University al- leging serious misconduct on the part of University staff including, inter alia, covert audio recordings of students, intentional disruption of sporting activi- ties, threatening students with academic repercussions, deceit and defama- tion. The Appellant argues that any references to this misconduct as a ‘dis- pute’ trivialise and misrepresent the misconduct and attempts to conceal it. Such misconduct by University staff that has been allowed to continue and has been ‘covered up’ by the institution is a matter of public interest. ii) Previous Requests by the Trust Contrary to the Decision Notice, the Trust has only made three previous FOIA requests. There is at least one FOIA request that was made by an individual unknown to the Trust, and no evidence has been provided that the remaining requests came from individuals associated with the Trust and not from jour- nalists or interested third parties. iii) Insufficient attempts to address the Trust’s concerns Following one meeting with senior University staff in October 2013, the Appel- lant alleges that the Trust was threatened with legal action and attempts were made to prevent the team competing in the British University league. A further meeting in January 2015 was also adjudged by the Appellant to be an attempt to conceal misconduct.The Commissioner’s Response: [10] i) Inaccurate Characterisation of the Background to the Request The Commissioner’s understanding is that the Oxford Blues team was formed from former members of the official University Ice Hockey Club (‘OUIHC’) as the result of an ongoing dispute over the organisation’s structure and the branding of merchandise. This and the allegations of misconduct are beyond the remit of this appeal, but the Commissioner now accepts that identifying and addressing such misconduct is in the public interest. Nevertheless, the extremely broad nature of the request in both subject matter and time period, with no direct link to the misconduct allegations, has lead the Commissioner to repeat his contention that the request is a fishing expedition likely to lead to further correspondence without providing any resolution to the disputes. ii) Previous Requests The Commissioner cannot determine whether the disputed twelve requests were associated with the trust, and as such the Commissioner requests that the University be joined to the appeal. However, the three previous requests made on behalf of the Trust are extremely broad in scope (albeit admittedly narrower than the instant request) and there exists a degree of overlap with the present request. The burden of complying, the disruption to and negative impact on staff members and the irritation of the requests is sufficient to meet the ‘high standard’ of vexatiousness described in Dransfield. iii) Insufficient Attempts to resolve the concerns The University’s attempts at resolving the dispute is out-with the remit of this appeal, and is not critical to the question of vexatiousness. Nevertheless, hav- ing reviewed the University’s evidence, the Commissioner is satisfied that there have been attempts made at a resolution.[11] In view of new evidence presented by the Appellant, which was not before the Information Commissioner at the time of his investigation, the Tribunal issued Direc- tions dated 29th September 2016, joining the University and requesting submissions from all parties as follows: i) The University to provide evidence as to the precise nature of the burden in complying, how it determined the previous requests to have come from the Trust, precisely what correspondence it considers to be ‘hostile’ and any fur- ther submissions regarding the involvement of particular staff members in the dispute. ii) The Appellant regarding his claims about certain meetings with the Univer- sity and if his complaint had been finalised. iii) The First Respondent as to whether the Appellant’s subject access request was a relevant consideration in relation to whether his request was vexatious and the independence of the University officer carrying out the internal re- view. The Directions required submissions within 28 days from all Parties with a further 14 days for submissions in response. THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD SUBMISSIONS [12] On 24th November 2016 the University replied. [13] Ms. Potts provided a witness statement. She is the Academic Registrar for the University, with responsibility for the co-ordination and development of student- related services and operations; in this case, she is charged with rebuilding relations between the University and the ice hockey community, and supporting members of OUIHC. She gave evidence that subsequent to the present appeal being lodged, the Appellant raised a formal complaint of harassment to the Vice Chancellor.Background to the Dispute: [14] Regarding the genesis of the dispute, it arose when certain members of the Men’s Ice Hockey Team within OUIHC objected to the Women’s team using OUIHC branding on their merchandise, being of the opinion that they should use the Oxford University Women’s Ice Hockey Club branding. OUIHC approached OUSF to at- tempt to resolve the dispute. OUSF ruled that the women’s team should be given the opportunity to use the OUIHC branding, but made certain criticisms of the layout of the website which did not adequately highlight the distinctions between the teams. [15] In protest, fifteen members of the men’s team resigned, one of which being the Appellant. They requested they be permitted to continue to play under the name ‘Oxford University Ice Hockey Club’. Mr. Roycroft, the University’s Director of Sport, began a series of discussions with a view to encouraging the dissenting players to rejoin OUIHC. This was unsuccessful, and the players formed their own team under the auspices of the Trust. The disagreement has now stretched beyond branding, and the dispute is which team is the proper successor to the historical Men’s Blues team and has the right to name its fixture against the University of Cambridge the ‘Varsity Match’. The University is only concerned that an independent group does not present itself as an official University team. [16] Ms. Potts accepted that, during a meeting in April 2013, Mr. Roycroft attempted to make an audio recording without the permission of the participants. This recording was discovered in the course of the meeting, immediately deleted and Mr. Roycroft apologised for his error of judgment. However, between 26 March 2013 and 4 Sep- tember 2015, the University received fifteen FOIA requests pertaining to this dispute. Mr. Damien Fessey, honorary trustee of the Trust at the time, made three of the re- quests and voluminous disclosure was made between June 2013 and March 2014. Ms. Potts noted that no complaints were forthcoming from the Trust from this time until after the present appeal was lodged. The harassment complaint was investi- gated by the University and dismissed without merit. Ms. Potts informed the Tribunal that much of the material used by the Appellant to ground this complaint was dis- closed to the Trust in the course of its requests.[17] The attempts to resolve the dispute are evidenced in Ms. Potts’ statement. She contrasts this with the Trust’s decisions to publish their own perspective (as she de- scribes, to “name and shame” alleged transgressors) on the dispute online, and al- leging that at times OUIHC’s Wikipedia page had been edited to redirect readers to the Trust’s website. Burden of Compliance: [18] Ms. Potts provided the evidence for the burden of complying with the Trust’s previous requests, requiring consultation with twenty-three individuals and taking more than twenty hours. She observes as well, that the Appellant made a subject access request for information held by the University, but with the exception of in- formation pertaining to him as a former student and staff member. Ms. Potts states that this left only information relating to his involvement with ice hockey. The request was complied with, and eighty-six pages were disclosed, taking eight hours for the Compliance Team to process. She gave evidence that this, along with all the other ice hockey requests with the exception of the instant request, requires an estimated compliance time of eighty-eight to one hundred hours. This is unprecedented for re- quests regarding university sports. [19] Regarding the other requests, they came from whatdotheyknow.com and use names that the University accepts are not transparently associated with the Trust or any known journalists; however, from a glance at their account history, these particu- lar usernames have only ever made requests to the University pertaining to this dis- pute. This would lead the University to conclude that they are not journalists but are in some way connected to the Trust. This suspicion is further heightened by the heated language used in some of the requests, with allegations and insinuations of misconduct in destroying, concealing or altering information. Finally, the responses to these requests are referenced and linked on Trust-affiliated websites.[20] The Appellant’s request as it stands would encompass thousands of email ad- dresses, covering three years of communications that would capture a significant amount of personal data and potentially require consultation with a vast number of individuals. If s14 had not been applied, the request would exceed the cost limit un- der s12 in any event. As the attempts at reconciliation stalled in 2014, there is unlikely in Ms. Pott’s estimation to exist any further material that could assist in re- solving the dispute that has not already been disclosed to the Trust. THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD: WITNESS STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR EWAN MCKENDRICK [21] The Tribunal noted a comment made by the Appellant in his grounds of appeal, which suggested that Professor McKendrick was line manager to Ms. Emma Potts (p.14). Whilst not explicitly stated, this appeared to the Tribunal to be suggesting that Professor McKendrick was insufficiently independent of the handling of the original request. Consequently the Tribunal directed that Professor McKendrick provide a witness statement setting out his involvement in the dispute, which he did on the 24th November 2016. In his statement Professor McKendrcick set out: “I only participated in one conference call with representatives of the Trust on 7 October 2014. I recall that Emma Potts was also involved with this call and that the relevant Trust representatives informed me within the two weeks thereafter that they had resigned from the Trust.” (para.4) “I was not otherwise involved in the dispute. I was not responsible for line managing Ms. Potts during the period in question because, in her role as Di- rector of Student Administration and Services, she was line managed by the Deputy Registrar, Michael Silby.” (para.5) [22] The Tribunal is satisfied that Professor McKendrick’s very limited involvement in the dispute does not sufficiently affect his independence in a way which would ren- der his internal review invalid.[23] The University adopted Ms. Potts’ statement, reiterating the cost of compliance issues and confirming that the University stopped actively pursuing a resolution of the dispute in February 2014. INFORMATION COMMISSIONER SUBMISSIONS [24] The Information Commissioner submitted that in her view: - i) the Appellant’s subject access request is a relevant part of the course of dealings between the Appellant and the University as it appears to be connected to the ongoing dispute; ii) if it were to be established that Professor McKendrick was involved in, or con- nected to the dispute in any way this would be a relevant factor and would diminish his independence. THE APPELLANT [25] Despite the Tribunal’s Directions, which were sent to all parties, and having been copied in to submissions from the First and Second Respondents, the Tribunal had received no submissions from the Appellant by the time of the second hearing on the papers on 20th December 2016. A copy of the Tribunal’s Directions was sent out in error following this and, whilst the First and Second Respondents sent further copies of their submissions, the Appellant sent none. On the 3rd January 2017 the Tribunal corresponded with the Appellant and made clear that no submissions had been received from him. On the same day the Appellant requested an extension of 28 days for his submissions, claiming that he had not understood the date by which these should have been made. The Second Respondent objected to this request stating that it had been clear from the Tribunal’s Directions when these should have been submitted. We are not satisfied that the Appellant has given any adequate reasons for an extension of time for him to respond further and in any event we do not consider it is in the public interest to delay the matter further.[26] The Tribunal further agrees with the Second Respondent. The timing of submis- sions was clear from Directions 3 and 4, which read as follows: Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, ad- dressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all Parties may serve submissions in response Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, ad- dressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all Parties may serve submissions in response Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, ad- dressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all Parties may serve submissions in response Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, ad- dressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all Parties may serve submissions in response3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, addressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all parties may serve submissions in response. [27] Accordingly the request by the Appellant for an extension of the time in which to make submissions is denied. Conclusions: [28] Despite the Directions issued by the Tribunal, the Appellant has provided no additional information in relation to the meeting with the University and also did not reply to any issues arising in the submissions or witness statement provided by the University or the further submissions from the Commissioner. [29] Specifically the Appellant did not rebut the information in the witness statement of Emma Potts which referred to the other requestors who ‘use names that the Uni- versity accepts are not transparently associated with the Trust or any known journal- ists’ and that their account history shows that these particular usernames have only ever made requests to the University pertaining to this dispute. [30] In his Grounds of Appeal the Appellant states that no evidence has been pro- vided by the University that ‘the other requests came from individuals associated with the Trust and not from journalists or interested third parties’ but the Tribunal notes that the Appellant has not provided any evidence to the contrary, for example to show that they are journalists. [31] The detailed understanding of the issues which were demonstrated by these other requestors, both in the wording of their requests and in their comprehensivechallenges to the information provided by the University in response to their re- quests, and the fact that their usernames have not been linked to any other requests, leads the Tribunal to accept, on the balance of probabilities, that these other re- questors have, at the very least, had discussion with the requestors and that these requests can, in our view properly be considered as part of the history of the Trust’s requests. [32] For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal upholds the Commissioner’s Decision Notice and dismisses the appeal. Our decision is unanimous. Brian Kennedy QC 6 February 2017."

The Appellant in these proceedings is an adviser to defendants in litigation relating to asbestos. He made a complaint to the Second Respondent, the General Medical Council (the “GMC”) about a doctor. He subsequently sought information from the GMC about the way the complaint was handled. On 24 December 2015, he wrote to the GMC and requested information in the following terms: “May we know who your Assistant Registrar consulted as an asbestos expert able to understand the seriousness of the actions of [Dr A].’ ‘May we have some information as to their asbestos qualifications?” 2. There was some contact between the parties’ out with the statutory framework of the Data Protection Act (DPA) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the GMC responded to the Appellant formally relying on s40 of FOIA which deals with personal information. S40 provides (so far as is relevant):- “Personal information. (1)Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2)Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case…..(4) The second condition….). (5)The duty to confirm or deny— (a)does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b)does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 or would do so if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of that Act were disregarded, or (ii)…. (6)…. (7)In this section— “the data protection principles” means the principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1 to the M7Data Protection Act 1998, as read subject to Part II of that Schedule and section 27(1) of that Act; “data subject” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act; “personal data” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act. 3. Relying on these provisions the GMC informed the Appellant that it would neither confirm nor deny that it held the information. This was in accordance with their standard procedure published as the General Medical Council – Publication and Disclosure Policy (bundle page 180-189) which is not to disclose the identity of doctors against whom a complaint is made unless formal regulatory action is taken such as a warning or referral for a disciplinary hearing by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. Confirming under FOIA that such information existed would unfairly breach the data protection principles and cause distress to Dr A since it would have the effect of disclosing to the world that a complaint had been made against him. 4. The Appellant complained to the First Respondent, the ICO who after investigation upheld the approach of the GMC; explaining that the right of access to information placed two distinct duties on public authorities, to inform an applicant whether or not requested information was held and secondly to communicate that information. However FOIA provided that s40(5)(b)(i) allowed the public authority to neither confirm nor deny that information was held if to confirm whether or not it held information would reveal personal data of a third party in breach of a data protection principle. Revealing the information would disclose personal information about Dr A. Revealing the information would not be processing fairly and lawfully (first data protection principle) since Dr A had a reasonable expectation that theirpersonal data would not be revealed. Revealing the information would have some impact on Dr A and be unfair. The ICO then balanced Dr A’s rights against the legitimate interest in confirming or denying that the information was held and concluded that while the information requested was of interest to the Appellant it did not outweigh Dr A’s right to privacy. 5. The Appellant was dissatisfied with this and appealed; repeating in summary form matters he had put to the GMC in his complaint and arguing that the GMC should have come to a different conclusion “we suspect he [the expert] must be a colleague of Dr A’s and also involved…” . 6. The ICO resisted the appeal relying on the decision notice and noting that there was no basis for the Appellant’s claim of impropriety and therefore this claim had no impact on the balance of public interest. The GMC supported the reasoning of the ICO setting out the case law stressing the fundamental rights protected by the DPA. The GMC noted the absence of substantive grounds of appeal and reaffirmed that disclosure would reveal personal information about a living person, be in breach of Dr A’s reasonable expectation and causing distress and so be unfair, there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and further arguing that there was no need to apply a public interest balancing test. 7. In his skeleton argument the Appellant made clear that his concern about Dr A arose from litigation where Dr A’s evidence had been preferred to evidence put forward by his associates. In the light of these litigation failures he had complained to the GMC challenging Dr A’s conduct. He argued that the GMC had handled the complaint incorrectly and disclosure of the information sought would help him and his associates understand how the GMC had made its error. In his oral argument he maintained his approach of misconduct by the GMC, the individual whose details he sought was “not impartial”. He emphasised that he wanted to use this information so he could force Dr A to have a meeting and discuss issues with him. 8. Counsel for the GMC relied on the arguments put forward by the ICO and GMC. She drew attention to the careful explanation given to the Appellant of the reasoning behind the GMC’s handling of his complaint (bundle page 103) and to the precedents of the High Court and Upper Tribunal (Corporate Officer of the House of Commons and Goldsmith) setting out when the legitimate interests of a third party could over-ride the privacy interest of a data subject. There was no pressing social need established by the Appellant. Consideration 9. In this case the appellant has in essence sought to re-argue cases which have been lost in the civil courts (which could have been subject to appeal) and to challenge the decision-making of the GMC (which may be done by judicial review). He has argued misconduct by the GMC or its staff but has notproduced a scintilla of evidence for it – save that it has come to a conclusion with which he disagrees. He has not disputed that the information is personal data nor has he addressed the fairness of the disclosure - his argument is focussed on the balance of public interest which he perceives. However the disclosure which he seeks does not assist in his public interest argument which relates to the civil litigation his associates are concerned with, nor does it help with his declared desire to have a meeting and discussion with Dr A; since he already knows who Dr A is. The tribunal is satisfied that the reasoning of the ICO in his decision notice is correct in law and dismisses this appeal. 10. Our decision is unanimous.

On 29 July 2016, the Appellant made an information request to the Department for Transport (“the Department”) for an electronic copy of the document containing the penalty fares appeals criteria used by the Independent Appeals Service and 10 approved by the Department. He acknowledged that he had previously asked for this information and that it had been refused on grounds that he did not accept1. 3. The Department refused the information request on 24 August 2016, in reliance upon the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) sections 41(1) and 44(1)(a). In particular, the Department relied on s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA, read in conjunction with s.145 15 of the Railways Act 1993. On internal review, it additionally relied upon s. 43(2) and s. 31(1)(c) FOIA in confirming its decision not to disclose on 23 September 2016. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner. 4. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50648036 on 23 March 2017, upholding the Department’s decision in applying the absolute exemption 20 under s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA read in conjunction with s. 145 of the Railways Act 1993. The Information Commissioner did not consider the other claimed exemptions and required no steps to be taken. Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 24 March 2017 relied on grounds of 25 appeal that the exemption was not engaged because s. 130 of the Railways Act 1993 does not itself permit penalty fares, but enables the making of secondary regulations for miscellaneous purposes. The penalty fares regime is therefore “a long way down the legislative chain” from the 1993 Act, with the effect that it would be wrong in principle to construe FOIA as permitting non-disclosure because all exemptions must 30 be construed restrictively. It was also argued that the Decision Notice made an impermissible finding of fact as to the circumstances in which the Department came by the information, in the absence of direct evidence. It was submitted that the appropriate conclusion would have been that the information was provided to the Department voluntarily. The Appellant additionally relied on submissions that the 35 Information Commissioner’s reading of the legislative regime for penalty fares infringed his rights under article 10 of the ECHR and that the failure to disclose information about the penalty fares regime infringed article 6 ECHR because the absence of information about its operation infringed the right to a fair trial by those who would wish to appeal against a penalty fare. It was submitted that the Railways 1 DN FS50619752 12 May 2016 2Act and FOIA should be interpreted by the Tribunal so as to give effect to these Convention rights. 6. The Information Commissioner’s Response dated 28 April 2017 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. It was submitted that s. 130 of the 1993 Act 5 (headed “Penalty Fares”) was a clear statutory power to create a penalty fares regime, permitting the creation of Regulations and Rules for this purpose. The Penalty Fares Rules 2002 were made under this statutory authority, and these Rules in turn provide for appeals and for a code of practice in relation to the conduct of appeals to be approved by the Department. A document submitted as part of that process is 10 therefore submitted under s. 130 and subject to s. 145 of the 1993 Act. It was submitted that the Information Commissioner was entitled to make a finding of fact on the balance of probabilities that the information had come into the Department’s possession in the course of this process. 7. As to the Human Rights Act arguments, it was submitted by the Information 15 Commissioner that (i) the Supreme Court’s judgment in Kennedy v Charity Commission [2015] AC 455 was a complete answer to the appellant’s assertion of article 10 rights in relation to the withheld information; (ii) if there were such a right, it would have to be enforced through judicial review and not in the Tribunal; (iii) that the Appellant’s Human Rights challenge was directed at the Railways Act 1993, 20 which argument was misconceived because the Tribunal’s task is to interpret FOIA; (iv) the Appellant has not established by evidence that his own Convention rights have been infringed; and (v) the Appellant has not established that Convention rights are engaged by the information requested. 8. The Department was joined as a Respondent to the Appeal on 20 April 2017. 25 Its Response (undated) relied on the Decision Notice, but also argued the engagement of the additional exemptions and the public interest balance in relation to those exemptions. The Department served witness statements made by Richard Mallett (Senior Revenue Protection Manager, South Western Railway), Nicola Welling (Corporate Affairs Director, Appeals Service) and Fiona Walshe (the Department’s 30 Deputy Director of Passenger Experience Policy). 9. The Appellant’s Reply to both Responses (undated) submitted that, taken at its highest, the Department’s case showed that the information had been provided to it “in connection with” its role under the statutory regime, but there was no evidence to support the position that it has been provided “by virtue of” the statutory regime. He 35 argued that the confidentiality provision under s. 145 of the 1993 Act was intended only to protect those who were required to provide commercially sensitive information to the Department, and not those who merely chose to do so. As to the Convention rights issue, he submitted that he had never suggested that his own Convention rights had been breached, but had sought to persuade the Tribunal to 40 arrive at an interpretation of the legislative regime which gives effect to Convention rights. He referred us to European jurisprudence and clarified his status as a journalist. 10. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising some 270 pages, including submissions made by all parties, for which we were grateful. It 3included the open witness statements relied on by the Department. We also viewed a Closed bundle comprising the withheld information and the closed versions of the witness statements. The Law 5 11. S. 44 (1) (a) FOIA provides that information is exempt if its disclosure is prohibited by another enactment. This is an absolute exemption, so no public interest balancing exercise is required. 12. S.145 of the Railways Act 1993 provides that: (1) …no information with respect to any particular business which – 10 (a) has been obtained under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this Act; and (b) relates to the affairs of any individual or to any particular business, shall, during the lifetime of that individual or so long as that business continues to be carried on, be disclosed without the consent of that 15 individual or the person for the time being carrying on that business”. 13. The Railways (Penalty Fares) Regulations 1994 provide at Regulation 11 for the Regulator to make Rules with respect to penalty fares and provides at (3) that “Rules made pursuant to this regulation shall have effect as if they were Regulations”. 20 14. The Penalty Fares Rules 2002 provide at 3.2 that “Any train operator who wants to introduce a penalty fares scheme must do the following. (a) Send a notice at least three months before the date on which it is proposed to begin charging penalty fares, to: 25 (i)The SRA; …” 15. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: 30 “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the 35 Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 4the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. 5 On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 16. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of 10 discretion rests with the Appellant. Evidence and Submissions 17. The Appellant relied on his written submissions and did not attend the oral hearing. He called no evidence. 18. The Tribunal viewed the withheld material in its Closed bundle. It consists of a 15 document used by the Independent Appeals Service, detailing the different reasons which might be given by an Appellant when challenging a penalty notice, and the circumstances in which such an appeal may be accepted or rejected. Mr Mallett’s evidence gave the Tribunal examples of how the fares system can be abused, leading to a loss of revenue by the train operating companies. The Tribunal heard oral 20 evidence from the Department’s witnesses in open and closed session. The closed evidence was “gisted” when the Tribunal returned to open session, as follows: the Tribunal looked at the withheld information itself and considered the extent to which a person seeking to appeal a penalty fare could realistically work out how to exploit the withheld information. 25 19. The Department relied on the evidence of Nicola Welling that the Independent Appeals Service’s Code of Practice was formally approved by the Department in January 2006, following the transfer of work from the SRA to the Department in October 2005. She exhibited to her open witness statement redacted copies of e-mails to this effect, in particular an e-mail from IAS to the Department on 25 January 2006 : 30 “…have you had a chance to put anything together yet in respect of DfT approval of IAS?” and a reply from the Department the next day: “I can confirm that the DfT has approved the …IAS Code of Practice for the purposes of rule 9 of the Penalty Fares Rules 2002 (appeals handling) in respect of several train operators’ Penalty Fares Schemes….” In answer to a question from the Tribunal in closed session, Ms Welling 35 confirmed that she had not found any other correspondence between IAS and DfT on this point. It was agreed that this information could have been given in open session, so it was repeated in full when the Tribunal resumed in open hearing. 20. Mr Paines’ closing submissions on behalf of the Information Commissioner were given in open session. He submitted that s. 44(1) (a) of FOIA provides a 40 complete answer to the Appellant’s request. Although he accepted that some of the other exemptions were engaged by certain parts of the withheld material, he regarded these arguments as academic to the current appeal. He submitted that there is a coherent chain of legislation beginning with the Railways Act 1993 and ending with 5the 2002 Rules, by virtue of which the train operating company was obligated to (“must”) send information to the regulator. This information is therefore provided “under” or “by virtue of” the legislative chain beginning with the 1993 Act and ending in the Rules. This must engage s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA, because the terms of s. 44 5 (1) (a) do not limit or prescribe the form of the relevant legislative prohibition. 21. Mr Paines submitted that it was more likely than not that the information in question had been provided to SRA for the purposes of the statutory scheme of approval. He noted that Ms Welling’s evidence (which had not been before the Information Commissioner when she issued her Decision Notice) made this scenario 10 even more likely. It was evidence from which the Tribunal could legitimately draw an inference, whereas there was no evidence at all to support the Appellant’s assertion that the information had been provided voluntarily. 22. As to the Human Rights Act points, Mr Paines submitted that the Appellant had not shown that articles 6 and 10 were engaged on the facts of this case and so the 15 European jurisprudence to which he referred in his submissions was not on point. Furthermore, as the meaning of the relevant provision of FOIA was quite clear, there was no requirement to interpret it to have a different meaning to give effect to Convention rights. 23. Mr Cross’s closing submissions on behalf of the Department were also given in 20 open session. Ms Welling’s witness statement had categorised the withheld information into three categories for the purpose of applying different exemptions and the Department’s case by the close of the evidence was that the “category 1” information should be withheld under s. 44 (1) (a) but that the category 2 and 3 information should be withheld under the remaining claimed exemptions. He 25 supported Mr Paines’ submissions as to the legitimacy of an inference to be drawn by the Tribunal from the e-mails exhibited by Ms Welling. 24. The Appellant’s written skeleton argument relied on submissions that the legislative prohibition of disclosure on which s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA rests must be contained in primary legislation and that the statutory provisions relied on in the 30 Decision Notice were too remote to engage the exemption. Further, that the Decision Notice’s conclusion that it was more likely than not that the information came into the possession of the Department as a result of the statutory requirements was impermissible on the evidence available. He repeated his submissions about the ECHR. 35 Conclusion 25. We agree with the Information Commissioner that, if s. 44 (1) (a) of FOIA is engaged by s. 145 of the Railways Act 1993 so as to prohibit disclosure of the information with which we are concerned, there is no need for us to look beyond that exemption and consider the other possible exemptions. Indeed, as s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA 40 is an absolute exemption; it seems to us appropriate to consider first whether it applies to the entirety of the withheld information. If this is the case then that disposes of the appeal. If not, then we consider that it is only in those circumstances that 6consideration of the engagement of the other qualified exemptions and the public interest balancing exercise in relation to all or part of the withheld information would be appropriate. 26. We find the meaning of s. 44 (1) (a) FOIA to be clear on its face and that there 5 is no ambiguity which would require us to interpret it and in so doing seek to give effect to Convention rights. We are not persuaded that article 6 ECHR is engaged by the facts of this case in any event, as we are not here considering the right to a fair hearing. We follow the approach of the UK Supreme Court to article 10 ECHR as a matter of precedent, and were not therefore persuaded that the European jurisprudence 10 to which the Appellant referred us was relevant to our consideration of this appeal. 27. We conclude that the Railways Act, Regulations and Rules together form a coherent statutory scheme capable of engaging s. 44 (1) (a) of FOIA. We were not persuaded by the Appellant’s argument that there is test of proximity to primary legislation to be applied in considering the efficacy of a statutory prohibition on 15 disclosure. We note that his proposed interpretation to this effect is without legal precedent. 28. We are satisfied that the factual conclusion reached in the Decision Notice, that on the balance of probabilities the information had been provided “under or by virtue of” the provisions of s. 130 of the Railways Act 1993, was a conclusion that the 20 Information Commissioner was entitled to reach and we discern no error in her approach. We have additionally had the benefit of reading the e-mail exchange produced in Ms Welling’s (unchallenged) evidence and we find that it provides us with an even firmer foundation from which to draw the same inference as did the Information Commissioner. We note that there is no evidence before us from which 25 we could infer that the withheld information was provided to the Department voluntarily or otherwise outside the parameters of the statutory scheme and so we reject the Appellant’s submission in this regard. 29. On the balance of probabilities, we are satisfied that the withheld information was submitted to the Department for the purposes of obtaining its approval of the 30 penalty fares regime, as required by the coherent legislative scheme to which we have referred. We conclude therefore that it was provided “under or by virtue of” s.130 of the Railways Act 1993, so as to engage s. 145(1)(a) of that Act and, in turn, s. 44 (1) (a) of FOIA. 30. In view of our conclusions, we did not find it necessary to consider the other 35 exemptions claimed by the Department or the witness evidence adduced in support of those exemptions. 31. For these reasons, the appeal is now dismissed. (Signed) 7ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 12 February 2018 PRINCIPAL JUDGE 5 8"

The appeal is allowed. The Decision Notice is set aside and substituted by this 5 Decision. The steps in paragraph 2 below are to be taken by the Cabinet Office. 2. The Cabinet Office is required to release a redacted copy of the withheld minutes to the Appellant, so that only item 3, paragraph 4 headed “National Defence Medal” may be read. REASONS 10 Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is involved with a campaign for the Government to create a National Defence Medal (“NDM”), to honour veterans who did not participate in a specific conflict but who stood ready to do so as members of the Armed Forces. This would include those who were conscripted into the Armed Forces after the Second 15 World War. Other Commonwealth countries, such as New Zealand and Australia confer such a medal for service of three and four years respectively. United States veterans are awarded a similar medal after three years’ service. In the United Kingdom, length of service is recognised only after fifteen years. 4. The Honours and Decorations Committee (“HDC”) is the permanent standing 20 committee of the Cabinet Office which provides advice to the Sovereign regarding honours, decorations and medals. Its terms of reference are: To consider general questions relative to the grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals; to review the scales of award, both civil and military, from time to time; to consider questions of new awards and changes in the conditions 25 governing existing awards. 5. In April 2012 the Prime Minister appointed Sir John Holmes to conduct an independent review of policy concerning medals, including consideration of the case for a National Defence Medal. Sir John recommended that the case for a NDM should ultimately be considered by the HDC, which should then make a recommendation to 30 government. Following that process, a written Ministerial Statement was issued on 29 July 2014 to the effect that the HDC “was not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time, but has advised that this issue might usefully be reconsidered in the future”. The HDC considered the matter again at a meeting in February 2015. 35 6. On 8 April 2015 the Appellant made a request to the Cabinet Office for minutes of the HDC. His request was in the following terms: Perhaps you could also pass on (under the FOI Act) a request to see the minutes of the HD Committee meeting which reached this conclusion. At least we will then be able to address the perceived weaknesses in the case, and you can stop 40 fielding the same questions. 27. The Cabinet Office refused the Appellant’s information request in reliance upon s. 37 (1) (b) and s. 35 (1) (a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). 8. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50588594 on 1 March 2016, upholding the Cabinet Office’s reliance on s. 37 (1) (b) of FOIA. The 5 Decision Notice found (at paragraph 13) that the exemption under s. 37 (1) (b) was engaged by the request and (at paragraph 25) that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption “by a narrow margin”. The Decision Notice expressly did not consider the Cabinet Office’s reliance on s. 35 (1) (b). Appeal to the Tribunal 10 9. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 27 March 2016 relied on grounds principally concerned with the balance of public interest test and argued strongly that the public interest favoured transparency and disclosure. He very fairly accepted that the requested minutes may need to be redacted so as not to impact on any individuals. He enclosed a report from the United Kingdom National Defence Medal Campaign 15 and a copy of its official submission to the government. 10. The Information Commissioner’s Response to the appeal dated 29 April 2016 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. It did not refer to s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA at all. 11. The Cabinet Office’s Response dated 28 June 2016 generally supported the 20 stance taken by the Information Commissioner. It was also asserted at paragraph 18 that, even if the Tribunal were to take a different view from the Information Commissioner as to disclosure under s. 37 (1) (b) of FOIA, the information requested would still not be disclosable because s. 35 (1) (a) would apply. We consider that argument in our conclusions below. 25 12. The Appellant replied to both Responses, emphasising the public interest in transparency and disclosure in relation to the honours system, and suggesting that the HDC was not truly independent. That is not of course a matter on which the Tribunal may adjudicate. 13. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for 30 determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. 14. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising some 200 pages, including submissions made by all parties, for which we were grateful. We also considered a closed bundle, consisting of the withheld information only. 35 15. The Tribunal initially convened on 27 September 2016, but adjourned without determining the appeal and directed further submissions from the parties. The Tribunal re-convened on 10 January 2017 to consider the submissions made and reach its decision. The Legal Framework 316. The duty of a public authority to disclose requested information is set out in s.1 (1) of FOIA. The exemptions to this duty are referred to in section 2 (2) as follows: “In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1 (1) (b) does not apply if or to the extent that – 5 (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 10 17. The categories of exemption which were initially relied upon under FOIA in this case are: s. 35 (1) (a) and s.37 (1) (b). These exemptions are both so-called qualified exemptions, giving rise to the public interest balancing exercise required by s. 2 (2) (b). 18. Section 35 (1) (a) FOIA provides as follows: 15 “(1) Information held by a government department…is exempt information if it relates to – (a) The formulation or development of government policy”. 19. Section 37 (1) (b) FOIA provides that: 20 “(1) Information is exempt information if it relates to – (b) the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity”. 20. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “(1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal consider - 25 (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 30 the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on 35 which the notice in question was based.” 21. The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Information Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. The standard of proof to be applied by the 40 Tribunal is the balance of probabilities. Scope of the Request 422. It seems to us that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the information request as to which HDC minutes were being requested. It is possible to read the request, in context, as being one for the minutes of the HDC which considered the matter in accordance with Sir John’s recommendations and preceded the written 5 Ministerial Statement as to its conclusions. The HDC minutes which the Information Commissioner considered and which were included in the closed bundle for the Tribunal were from a meeting which took place some months later in February 2015, after the written Ministerial Statement and at which HDC had discussed further correspondence on the subject of the NDM (open bundle page 161). 10 23. The Information Commissioner and the Cabinet Office responded to our enquiry about this by confirming that the closed material which we had before us was the correct document. Considering the ambiguity in the request and applying the balance of probabilities standard, we find this to be a reasonable understanding and we do not consider that the Decision Notice was erroneous in this regard. We note 15 that it is still open to the Appellant to make a more clearly-worded request for the minutes of the earlier HDC meeting should he choose. 24. The Decision Notice concludes at paragraph 11 that the requested minutes cover more than one issue. However, we take the view that the request (set out at paragraph 6 above) is, properly understood, much narrower in scope than the Information 20 Commissioner understood it to be. We therefore conclude that the Decision Notice was erroneous in its findings as to the scope of the Appellant’s request. 25. We understand the request to be limited to the specific section of the HDC minutes which dealt with the NDM. We take this view on a plain reading of the request, taken in the context of the exchange of correspondence on 8 April 2015 25 (pages 160 to 161 of the open bundle). The official from the Honours and Appointments Secretariat states in his letter to the Appellant that the HDC members remain unpersuaded of the case for an NDM at this time and the Appellant replies with a request for the minutes of the committee which reached this conclusion. It does not seem to us that the information request is concerned with the HDC’s wider 30 work or with the minutes of the HDC in relation to any other issue. We note that the Appellant envisaged and accepted in his Notice of Appeal that there may be other matters contained in the HDC minutes which should be redacted. 26. We conclude that the scope of the request is limited to item 3, paragraph 4 of the February HDC minutes contained in our closed bundle, headed “National Defence 35 Medal”. We have therefore considered the engagement of the exemption under s. 37 (1) (b) in respect of that paragraph alone. Engagement of s.37 (1) (b) 40 27. When we adjourned on 27 September 2016, we directed the parties to make submissions on the question of whether the s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA exemption was engaged in relation to the conferral of existing Honours and Dignities only, or 5whether its scope also extended to the creation of a new Honour or Dignity. The Information Commissioner submitted that the exemption refers to both existing and proposed Honours and Dignities, and referred us to the Commissioner’s own published guidance to that effect. The Cabinet Office submitted that the wording of s. 5 37 (1) (b) FOIA was deliberately broad and that the word “any” is all-encompassing, so that the natural reading of the section was wide enough to include “all honours, past and future”. It refers us to archived Ministry of Justice Guidance which supports this view. The Appellant submitted that an Honour or Dignity cannot be conferred by the Crown if it does not exist. 10 28. We share the Appellant’s concern as to the scope of s. 37 (1) (b). If the exemption was in respect of information that merely related to any Honour or Dignity then the creation of a new award would be caught. However, Parliament chose to use the words “conferring by the Crown” in this section of FOIA. The meaning of “conferring” is “the act of bestowing”. We appreciate the policy behind the 15 exemption and note that the public interest balancing exercise tends to refer to the need to protect confidences, and to ensure candour in the recommendation process, but such considerations do not seem to us to be relevant in relation to a medal which does not exist and so cannot be conferred. 29. The Cabinet Office submitted that, were we to take the view that s. 37 (1)(b) 20 were not engaged by information pertaining to the creation of a new medal, that this view would be inconsistent with previous decisions of the Information Commissioner and of the First-tier Tribunal. We acknowledge this to be the case, but remind the parties that differently-constituted panels of the First-tier Tribunal are not bound by each other’s decisions and are at liberty to disagree with each other and indeed with 25 the Information Commissioner. 30. The Cabinet Office and Information Commissioner also submitted that the guidance issued by ICO and the Ministry of Justice was relevant in interpreting FOIA. We found the guidance useful but we do not consider that it is strictly appropriate to rely on it in interpreting a statutory provision as it does not meet the criteria for the 30 use of extrinsic materials as an aid to interpretation set out by the House of Lords in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart [1992] UKHL 31. We note that the IC’s guidance is in itself somewhat ambiguous in referring to “new awards2”. This could be understood to refer to the conferral of a new award on an individual, rather than the creation of a new Honour. 35 31. Having considered the issue carefully, we have concluded that the exemption under s.37 (1) (b) is not engaged by information relating to a proposed new medal. We conclude that Parliament’s use of the word “conferring” in s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA is intended to relate to Honours and Dignities which already exist and so may be “conferred”. Having reached this conclusion, we have not found it necessary to go on 1 http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/3.html 2 https://ico.org.uk/media/for- organisations/documents/1194/communications_with_her_majesty_and_the_awarding_of_honours.pdf 6to consider the relevant public interest arguments. We note that the Decision Notice (paragraph 25) described that issue as “finely balanced”. Engagement of s. 35 (1) (a) 32. The Decision Notice did not reach any conclusions as to the engagement of s. 5 35 (1) (a) FOIA. The Cabinet Office has suggested that we may nevertheless decide to withhold the disputed information in reliance upon s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA. 33. We have considered carefully whether it would be within the scope of our powers under s. 58 FOIA (see paragraph 20 above) for us to determine here whether the withheld information engaged the s.35 (1) (a) exemption and, if so, whether the 10 balance of public interest favoured disclosure. We note that, despite the apparently limiting terms in which the scope of s. 58 FOIA is expressed, the nature of a First-tier Tribunal hearing has been described as de novo, so that we “stand in the shoes”3 of the Information Commissioner and can make any decision that she could have made. That would suggest that we do have power to consider at this stage the exemption on 15 which the Cabinet Office originally relied but which was not adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner. 34. We note that this is not a question of whether to allow the public authority to rely on a completely new exemption, which was the situation considered by the Court of Appeal in the context of the Environmental Information Regulations in Birkett v 20 DEFRA [2011] EWCA (Civ) 16064. In that case, the Tribunal’s own case management powers were prayed in aid in ensuring that the Appellant would not be surprised by a new argument at the last minute. In this case, the Appellant was on notice that s.35 (1) (a) FOIA was at issue when he made his complaint to the Information Commissioner, but he has understandably been left in the position of 25 considering it no longer to be relevant, due to the Information Commissioner’s non- determination of that issue. We wonder whether it is fair and just in those circumstances for the Cabinet Office to be allowed to revert to its pre-Decision Notice reliance on that exemption? We note that the Cabinet Office has not appealed against the Decision Notice on the basis that it’s initial reliance upon s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA 30 should have been adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner. It would have been open to it to do so. We are left with a situation where, as the Decision Notice did not reach a conclusion on that issue, none of the parties appear to have regarded s. 35 (1) (a) as being seriously in play in this appeal, with the effect that we have received limited argument on that issue. 3 See Guardian Newspapers Limited v IC and BBC, IT, 8 January 2007 (referred to in Coppell: Information Rights Law and Practice, Fourth Edition, 28-020; see also the discussion of the First-tier Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the Upper Tribunal’s decision in Birkett [2011] UKUT 39 AAC http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2011/39.html and in IC v Bell [2014] UKUT 0106 (AAC) at [22]. 4 http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1606.html 735. In all the circumstances, we express considerable reservations as to whether we are technically seized of the s. 35 (1) (a) issue, given that it did not feature in the Decision Notice against which we are considering an appeal. Alternatively, if we are seized of it in the exercise of our de novo jurisdiction, then we are concerned that it is 5 not fair and just to reach a determination on an issue which the Appellant was not properly fore-warned may feature in our conclusions. We regard the failure of the Decision Notice to determine a key issue between the parties as rather unsatisfactory, especially given that the Information Commissioner has concluded at least one other matter in relation to the NDM where her Decision Notice was in respect of s. 35 (1) 10 (a) FOIA5. We note that we have no power to remit the matter to the Information Commissioner for her further consideration before determining this appeal – see Information Commissioner v Bell [2014] UKUT 106 (AAC)6. 36. Notwithstanding our concern as to whether it is right to do so, we have set out below our findings in relation to s.35 (1) (a) FOIA. When considering the Cabinet 15 Office’s submission in relation to s. 35 (1) (a), we asked the parties in our adjournment directions to comment on whether government policy in relation to the NDM was still being formulated or developed at the time of the Appellant’s request. The Cabinet Office’s response to our query was that the phrase “might usefully be reconsidered in the future” contained in the Ministerial Statement meant that the 20 policy was left open and live. The Information Commissioner’s response was that the matter was unclear and that the Cabinet Office was better placed to assist the Tribunal. The Appellant submitted that the NDM is no longer under consideration and so there is no process of policy formulation to protect by withholding the requested information. 25 37. It does seem to us that, if it were the case that policy in relation to the NDM were still being formulated or developed, then s. 35 (1) (a) would be the most natural provision of FOIA to be engaged in relation to consideration of the creation of a completely new medal. We note that a differently-constituted panel of the First-tier Tribunal considered s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA in relation to the minuted discussion of the 30 NDM by HDC’s Advisory Military Sub-Committee in Halligan v IC and MOD EA/2015/0291. It was not disputed before that Tribunal that s. 35(1)(a) was engaged, although the Tribunal at paragraph [23] noted the arguments to the effect that policy development in relation to the NDM was no longer live. The Tribunal in that case decided that the public interest did not favour maintaining the exemption and directed 35 that redacted minutes should be disclosed. 38. In the evidence and submissions before us in this appeal, we note that there is evidence that policy is still being formulated or developed. This is in the form of a letter from the Cabinet Office to the Information Commissioner (see p.190 of the open bundle) where it is stated: “policy in relation to the National Defence Medal was at 40 the time of the request, and continues to be, a live issue….”. 5 DN FS50584583, appealed to the Tribunal and mentioned in paragraph 37 of this Decision. 6 IC v Bell [2014] UKUT 0106 (AAC). 839. However, we also have evidence before us which would lead us to a contrary conclusion. This is the letter from the HDC Secretariat to the Appellant (see p.161 of the open bundle) which states: “there are no plans for further work on this issue”. 40. We also have before us evidence which we regard as ambiguous, namely the 5 written Ministerial Statement (see p.202 of the open bundle) which states: “The Committee on the grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals is not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time, but has advised that this issue might usefully be reconsidered in the future”. 41. Applying the balance of probabilities test to the totality of the evidence, we 10 conclude that we cannot be satisfied on the evidence before us that it is more likely than not that policy in relation to the proposed NDM was still being formulated or developed at the time of the Appellant’s request. We are not persuaded by the Cabinet Office’s submission that the terms of the Ministerial Statement left the issue open. As the Information Commissioner did not reach a conclusion on that issue, we regard the 15 Cabinet Office, in seeking to rely on s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA, as bearing an evidential burden in relation to that issue. We find that this has not been discharged to the required standard. Conclusion 42. For the above reasons, we conclude that the Decision Notice was not in 20 accordance with the law. We find that (i) the scope of the Appellant’s request was narrower than the Decision Notice found it to be; (ii) that s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA is not engaged by the information request; (iii) we express doubt that it is open to us to reach a view as to s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA when it was not adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner, but if we may properly do so, then we find that that exemption was not 25 engaged at the time of the request. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, and the Cabinet Office is required to take the steps set out at paragraph 2 above (Signed on the original) 30 ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 16 January 2017 PRINCIPAL JUDGE 9"

If we had taken a different view of the merits of these appeals, it would have been necessary to distinguish in certain respects the issues arising and to issue two Decisions. In the event, the issues requiring determination are identical and the sensible course is to issue a single Decision. The Background 2. In 2009 a grant was made by BLF to Melness and Tongue Community Development Trust (“MTCDT”) in Sutherland to assist with the construction of a triple turbine wind farm to be owned by the community. It was intended that land would be leased for the purpose. The plan was that income from the sale of electricity generated by the wind farm would finance a number of community projects. It seems that it provoked significant local opposition, as is common with such proposed developments, 3. MTCDT, through its trustees, owned a company, Melness and Tongue Community Energy Ltd. (“MTCE”), which evidently provided or subcontracted services relating to the wind farm project. Substantial sums were drawn down against the National Lottery grant. They were released 5on production of invoices by MTCDT, the grant holder, or (albeit incorrectly) by MTCE. 4. After substantial work had been done and expenditure incurred, the project had to be halted when the proposed lessors of the land decided not to grant a lease. MTCDT obtained BLF’s consent to investigate alternative possibilities, which have no bearing on this appeal. 5. Not surprisingly, there was local concern at the lack of any benefit from an outlay of charitable funds over a four – year period amounting to £360,000, part capital, part revenue expenditure. That said, there is no evidence before the Tribunal that any of those funds had been misapplied. 6. JB is a local resident and owns a local retail business. On 30th. June, 2015 he submitted by email to BLF a wide – ranging FOIA request for information relating to the grant application, the monitoring, the use of funds, the accounts of MTCDT and MTCE and the treatment of their directors and trustees. On 3rd. July, 2015, following discussions with the relevant manager, Craig Russell, he submitted a request (“the first request”) for – “details of any money received by (MTCDT) and associated entities, including amounts and proposed uses. If possible could we have any details of audits on the money spent”. In a separate email he made a further request which was one of several which were not the subject of either DN and do not, therefore, feature in this Decision. 67. On 30th. July, Mr. Russell replied on behalf of BLF. He explained that the information sought was, in the BLF’s opinion, “environmental information” as defined in EIR 2(1) and that BLF had removed names from many documents in compliance with reg.13(1). He provided a considerable volume of documentary information within the scope of the amended request. It included spreadsheets showing the sums released and the proposed uses for which they were intended. He interpreted the request for details of audits as a request for the claim forms submitted by MTCDT and the supporting invoices to which they related which was clearly what JB was seeking. These classes of document included two claim forms and a series of seven invoices from which the name and business address of an individual (“W”), as distinct from a corporate or partnership supplier had been redacted, as indicated in Mr. Russell’s letter. 8. That form and those invoices, supplied in that redacted form give rise to these appeals. Other exclusions of names in other documents supplied are unchallenged. 9. Faced with this reply and following an internal review which maintained the refusal to disclose W’s identity, JB submitted a letter on 12th. September, 2015 (“the second request”), asking for confirmation that the excluded information on the invoices and claim form – “were not from a Director or Trustee of either related entity, MTCDT or MTCE. A simple yes I can confirm that they were/ or were not a Director or Trustee. Can you also confirm that this statement includes the company secretary at the time . . . .?” 7He observed that the relevant Statement of Recommended (accounting) Practice (“SORP”) required that MTCDT, as a charity, should declare any payments to a director or trustee. 10. On 24th. September, 2015 Mr. Russell confirmed that no payments made to MTCDT were for any director or trustee of MTCDT, which, as the grant holder, was the only company on which he could comment. He pointed out that a company secretary is neither. He added that BLF was satisfied as to the propriety of the invoices. JB asked for an internal review of this reply. 11. BLF provided a detailed and carefully argued review on 13th. November, 2015. It recited the history of the requests and responses. It concluded that the requests should have been handled under s. 40(2) of FOIA, since this was not environmental information. It stated that the letter of 13th. September, 2015 had not been treated as a FOIA or EIR request because it asked for an interpretation of information held rather than recorded information. Information as to whether the invoices related to a director or trustee of MTCE had not been held when requested. It was held now but the directors or trustees of MTCE were a small group and confirmation or denial could breach data protection rights. The SORP did not apply to MTCE since it was not a charity. BLF therefore neither confirmed nor denied holding the requested information. 12. JB complained to the ICO as to both his requests on 22nd. December, 2015. The ICO decided to treat the requests as separate matters requiring two DNs. As to the second request (if it was a request), he clarified that it concerned “whether the invoices that were submitted to BLF related to a director or trustee of MTCDT and/or of MTCE Ltd. Or to any other 8related entity.” (The evidence does not suggest that there was any further related entity.) The DNs 13. The ICO (rightly, in our view, though which regime applies has no practical importance) ruled that neither request involved environmental information, hence that FOIA s.40(2) governed issues of personal data. Plainly, the first request involved the personal data of W. W did not give his/her consent to disclosure. The first DN concluded that disclosure of W’s name would breach the FDPP. W would reasonably expect that his/her name would not be made public; that was also what BLF expected. Given the strong feelings aroused by the issue of the wind turbines, W was at risk of suffering ostracism, distress and even physical abuse, if identified. As to compliance with condition 6 of Schedule 2 to the DPA, whilst there was a legitimate public interest in the greatest possible transparency, where significant sums of money raised for charitable purposes were spent, especially where nothing had come of that expenditure, nevertheless disclosure was unwarranted, considering the prejudice to W’s rights to privacy and a peaceful personal life. The ICO did not expressly consider whether disclosure was necessary for that legitimate interest but stated that service of the redacted documents ”serves that purpose”, which suggests that it was not. 14. The second DN did not address the question whether the second request was a request for the purpose of FOIA s.1. It observed that the requested information had not been held by BLF at the date of the request but only later. However, it proceeded to consider whether disclosure would involve W’s personal data and noted that there were only two persons 9who were directors of MTCE but not of MTCD, hence that that there was a strong likelihood that a positive answer to the question posed (should that be the right answer) would identify the individual, just as though his/ her name had been disclosed. 15. The second DN acknowledged the “strong argument in favour of disclosure of the position/ role of the individual(s) who submitted the invoices” and “a public interest in such organisations (as MTCE) being accountable for the spending of public money.” It evidently recognized JB’s “legitimate interest” in the information and perhaps, by implication, the necessity of disclosure if such interest was to be satisfied. However, it found that W had no reasonable expectation of disclosure and that, given the attitude of many local residents, it would cause W unwarranted distress and possibly even “damage”. It would, therefore be unfair and would breach W’s rights under the FDPP. a reply neither confirming nor denying (NCND) that it held the information. The correct - and certainly the less problematic - reply was, however, that it did not hold the information when the request was made. 16. JB appealed both DNs by notice dated 14th. April, 2016. Put summarily, the relevant grounds were that £20,000 (the total of the amounts charged on the invoices) was public money and that the local community should know how it was spent and to whom it was paid. The SORP recommendation extended to entities linked to those receiving charitable funds so that BLF must state whether W was a director of MTCE. W cannot have had a reasonable expectation that he/she would not be identified to the public. His reply to the ICO’s response was a commentary on each paragraph, indicating both agreements and dissent. In essence it reflected the above summary. 1017. The ICO, in her response, submitted that the Tribunal should uphold the first DN for the reasons already specified. She invited the Tribunal to substitute for the second decision notice a notice stating that BLF was not under a duty to provide the requested information since it did not hold it at the material time, alternatively to uphold the DN on the ground that BLF was entitled to NCND the request pursuant to FOIA s.40(5)(i). The difficulties inherent in either of those findings are not considered in this Decision since the Tribunal finds that the information sought in the first request is disclosable. The reasons for our decisions 18. Important considerations specific to the first appeal are contained in the Closed Annex. Nevertheless, a number of relevant factors can be discussed in this open Decision. 19. We concur with the ICO’s assessment of the general public interest in the greatest possible transparency in the application of public funds, especially perhaps, where they are committed to charitable purposes. Furthermore, it is obvious that such an interest could not be satisfied in this case without the disclosure of W’s identity. The precise strength of that public interest can only be assessed by reference to the nature of the link between W and the grant – holder. We put the matter in that way because the very fact that W received payment for his/her services from MTCD’s subsidiary created a link of sorts. 1120. The fact that no public benefit was derived from the expenditure, whilst no fault of W, heightens, to some extent, the public interest in where the money went, quite regardless of the good faith of all concerned. 21. The strength of the public interest is further examined in the Closed Annex. 22. When assessing W’s reasonable expectations of identification, it is fair to assume that he was aware, when his services were engaged, that the funding came from the National Lottery, hence that public scrutiny of its use might well be intense especially where it involved a bold innovative project such as wind turbines intended to produce income for community objectives, yet facing a substantial risk of failure. Such considerations might well, without more, alert W to the possibility that, in a relatively small community, there could be particularly substantial and successful pressure for publication of the identity of contractors, especially if the project encountered difficulties. The fact that BLF considers that individuals invoicing MTCD would not expect disclosure, is of limited relevance, since BLF’s knowledge of the contractors would be limited to a name and the nature of the service provided, as they appeared on a claim form. It is entirely right that BLF would not volunteer their identities unless lawfully required to do so. 23. When considering the issue of prejudice to W’s rights and interests said to be likely to result from disclosure, it is not unreasonable to compare with W’s asserted vulnerability, the position of individuals, whether directors or partners, controlling the companies and partnerships of which the names were disclosed, on the face of their invoices, in response to JB’s request. As to two of the partnerships, the partners were named on 12the stationery; as to the companies and the other partnership, the directors and partners could be identified by the most straightforward research. They were not global giants but, seemingly, with one exception, modest – sized locally or regionally – based companies and partnerships - judging by the number of partners in the latter case. It is plainly arguable that those individuals, partners and directors, were readily identifiable from the publication of the company and partnership names and equally exposed to local opprobrium. Of course, if BLF was under a duty, pursuant to s.40(2), to protect W’s personal data, the fact that it failed to do the same for others (if indeed it did) would not justify disclosure of W’s identity in breach of the FDPP. However, it may justify reflection as to whether W had a reasonable expectation of anonymity whereas, in BLF’s and the ICO’s view, such directors and partners of entities likewise receiving BLF – funded payments did not. The corporate or partnership name was a flimsy veil, if a veil at all, for their identities. 24. Furthermore, if W’s expressed fears of retribution were realistic, it might be expected that some evidence of subsequent animosity towards individuals directing these other entities, whose identities have been publicized or readily discoverable for nearly a year (since 13th. November, 2015) might be available. None was adduced and we are entitled to conclude that no significant hostility has been demonstrated. Of course, these matters must be judged as at the date of the request but subsequent events, or the lack of them, may be relevant to the material question : was there real substance in W’s apprehension or was it an understandable but baseless anxiety ? 25. A further factor material to expressions of hostility and consequent distress is the geographical relationship between the community of 13Melness and Tongue and W’s business and residence. W’s business address appears on the unredacted invoices, as is to be expected. It is fair to assume in the absence of contrary evidence, which would be instantly available, if it existed, that W’s home is relatively close to his business. His business address is a very considerable distance from Melness or Tongue. That address and the approximate distance, as available on the internet, is stated in the Closed Annex. 26. The Tribunal considered JB’s argument as to the application of the SORP material to charities. Paragraphs 9.13 – 9.17 set out the recommendations as to the disclosure of transactions between charities, such as MTCD and “related persons” (entities). That class is defined in Appendix 1 to SORP and clearly includes subsidiary companies such as MTCE (The evidence is that MTCE is wholly owned by MTCD, which is itself a trust.) That recommendation has been followed. MTCE is not a charity and the SORP does not appear to extend the duty of disclosure to transactions between related persons and third parties, corporate or individual. We do not place any reliance, therefore, on this argument, in reaching our decisions. 27. We therefore find that disclosure of the information covered by the first DN would not be unfair. Implicit within that finding is our conclusion that Condition 6 of the First Schedule to the DPA is satisfied because disclosure is necessary to satisfy the legitimate public interest in knowing to whom the sum of £20,000 charged by the redacted invoices was paid and that disclosure in this case is not unwarranted by reason of prejudice to W’s rights and freedoms or legitimate interests. 1428. For the reasons set out in this Decision and in the Closed Annex, the first appeal is therefore allowed. 29. As to the second appeal, the ICO’s Decision is, with respect, of no practical consequence, given the Tribunal’s decision on the first appeal. We see no purpose in dismissing the appeal on the ground that MTCD did not hold the information at the material time, since a fresh but now pointless request could be made. To strike it out would be quite inappropriate. We shall therefore adjourn this appeal sine die but give all parties permission to submit short written argument on this outcome within 14 days of receiving this Decision, if so advised. 30. Our decisions are unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 11th. October, 2016 1516"

Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-EA/2015/0194 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 17 August 2015. 2. It arises from a request for information made to the Cabinet Office under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), by Mr. Gabriel Webber (the “Appellant”), a freelance journalist. The request concerned information about the Public Duty Cost Allowance (“PDCA”) which provides an allowance to former Prime Ministers, for office and secretarial expenses, incurred in connection with their public duties. The allowance is currently set at a maximum of £115,000 per year for each former Prime Minister. The Request 3. The Appellant’s request was made on 29 June 2014, on the following terms: “According to a PQ [Parliamentary Question] answered by Lord Wallace of Saltaire, former Prime Ministers can claim an allowance if they provide receipts or other supporting documentation. Please could you release the amount claimed by each former Prime Minister in each calendar year 2005-2013 inclusive, and also provide a copy of all receipts or other supporting documentation submitted in respect of this allowance since January 2012. If the cost threshold obstructs this then please provide ONLY copies of receipts and supporting documentation since June 2013.” 4. The Cabinet Office replied on 21 July 2014. It treated the request as consisting of two parts: (i) the total amount claimed by each former Prime Minister in the years 2005 to 2013; and (ii) copies of each former Prime Minister’s receipts and other supporting documentation. 5. It refused disclosure of the information within the scope of (i) on the basis of sections 21(1) and 22(1) of FOIA (information accessible by other means, and information intended for future publication). It refused to -3-disclose the information within the scope of (ii) on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA (third party personal data). 6. The Appellant requested an internal review of the Cabinet Office’s decision in respect of (ii). The Cabinet Office conducted a review, but maintained its refusal. Complaint to the Commissioner 7. On 30 October 2014, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner. He said that he accepted the Cabinet Office’s response in respect of part (i) of his request, but did not accept its refusal under section 40(2) of FOIA to disclose the information sought in part (ii). 8. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Cabinet Office maintained its reliance on section 40(2), but sought additionally to rely on section 41(1) (information provided in confidence), to refuse part (ii) of the request. The Commissioner’s Decision 9. For the reasons set out in his Decision Notice, the Commissioner made the following findings. 10. First, the Commissioner found that the information was exempt from disclosure under section 41(1). 11. In relation to the exemption in section 41(1), it was necessary to consider whether the information was obtained by the Cabinet Office from a third party, and clearly it was. As to whether disclosure would constitute an actionable breach of confidence, the Commissioner applied the test in Coco v A. N. Clark (Engineers) Limited [1968] FSR 415, and found that the test was met. In particular (a) the information had the necessary quality of confidence; (b) the information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and (c) the unauthorised use of the information would be of detriment to the confider. 12. As to whether the Cabinet Office would have a public interest defence were it to disclose the information, the Commissioner acknowledged that there was a public interest in being able to see how former Prime Ministers justify the allowances they claim. However, the Commissioner considered that this public interest was met by disclosure, to the public, of the total amounts claimed by former Prime Ministers under the PDCA. Knowing the minutiae of such claims would not add much of significance to the public’s understanding of this element of government spending. The Commissioner concluded that the Cabinet Office would not have a public interest defence were it to disclose the information. 13. Having reached the decision that the information was exempt from disclosure under section 41(1), the Commissioner did not consider it necessary to go on to determine whether the information was also exempt under section 40(2). However, the Commissioner considered it -4-likely that the information relating to those individuals alive at the time of the request would also be exempt under section 40(2). 14. The Commissioner also found that because of its late reliance on section 41(1), the Cabinet Office had breached section 17(1). The Appeal to the Tribunal 15. The Appellant has appealed to the First-tier Tribunal in relation to the information coming within the scope of part (ii) of his request. 16. The Appellant has requested that the appeal be determined on the papers without an oral hearing, and the Commissioner has concurred. Having regard to the nature of the issues raised, and the nature of the evidence, we have been satisfied that the appeal can properly be determined without an oral hearing. 17. We have received an open and closed bundle of documents. The closed bundle has been prepared by the Commissioner, and the Appellant has not had sight of it. We have considered all the documents received, even if not specifically referred to in this decision. 18. There has been no cross-appeal by the Cabinet Office, and it has not applied to be joined as party to this appeal. 19. Certain parts of our decision are set out in a separate Confidential Annex in order to avoid defeating the purpose of any onward appeal there might be. Issues 20. This appeal only concerns the information coming within the scope of part (ii) of the Appellant’s request (for copies of each former Prime Minister’s receipts and other supporting documentation). We will refer to this information as the Disputed Information. 21. The first issue before us is whether the Cabinet Office was entitled to withhold the Disputed Information under section 41(1) of FOIA. If it was, then that determines the appeal. 22. If it was not, then we must go on to consider whether the Cabinet Office was entitled to withhold the Disputed Information under section 40(2). The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 23. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal against the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute -5-such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 24. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. Findings 25. Under section 1(1)(a) of FOIA, a person who has made a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed, in writing, whether the public authority holds that information. Under section 1(1)(b), he is entitled to have that information communicated to him. 26. The duty under section 1 does not arise if any of the exemptions set out in FOIA apply. The first exemption being relied on in the present case is that contained in section 41 (information provided in confidence). 27. Section 41(1) provides as follows: “(1) Information is exempt information if - (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person.” 28. We agree with the Commissioner that the requirement of section 41(1)(a) is met because the information was clearly obtained from another person, namely from former Prime Ministers or from their staff on their behalf. We also agree that the test to be applied in relation to whether disclosure would constitute an actionable breach of confidence, is that set out in Coco v Clark. However, we do not agree that that test is met on the facts of this case. 29. We find that the information was not provided in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. The Appellant says, and we agree, that in a post FOIA era, a former Prime Minister cannot reasonably have expected that he or she could claim up to £115,000 per annum, for life, from the public purse, without the public expecting there to be transparency as to what the money is being spent on. 30. In finding otherwise, the Commissioner seems to have relied on the Cabinet Office’s assertion that the information was provided to it in strict confidence and on the understanding that it would not be disclosed. The Commissioner has said, in his Response dated 29 September 2015, that he has no reason to doubt the Cabinet Office’s explanation in this regard. The Commissioner noted that the understanding that the information -6-would be kept confidential, was evidenced, in some cases, by the inclusion of the words ‘Private and Confidential’, on the documents supplied, although the Commissioner acknowledged that this was not determinative. The Commissioner, noted however, that it is the practice for the total amounts claimed under the PDCA to be published, while a breakdown of the information is not. The Commissioner says that this supports the conclusion that the information was provided to the Cabinet Office on the understanding that it would not be disclosed. 31. In our view, no evidence has been provided to support the Cabinet Office’s assertion that the information was provided to it in confidence. There is no correspondence, protocol, memorandum of understanding or evidence of any other communication before us between the Cabinet Office and any former Prime Ministers in which the confidentiality of the information has been discussed, much less agreed. The fact that a breakdown has not previously been disclosed does not mean that the information was provided in confidence. As the Commissioner has acknowledged, the words ‘Private and Confidential’ cannot be determinative. In any event, these words appear on only one invoice, and that is for the full amount of £115,000. That amount has been disclosed, so clearly the Cabinet Office has not itself treated those words as importing an obligation of confidence. 32. Even if we are wrong about this, we find that the public interest would constitute a defence to an action for breach of confidence. The Commissioner acknowledged that there is a public interest in being able to see how former Prime Ministers use the allowances they claim. However, in the Commissioner’s view, this public interest is met by disclosure of the total amounts claimed by former Prime Ministers under the PDCA. The Commissioner considered that knowing the minutia of such claims would not add much of significance to the public’s understanding of this element of government spending. We do not agree. It is the breakdown of the expenditure that tells the public how the money is being spent, and allows them to form a view as to whether it is being spent responsibly, and in a manner that is commensurate with the public benefit, or perceived public benefit, derived from it. 33. The Commissioner has sought to distinguish the present case from Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner & Others [2008] EWHC 1084, concerning a request under FOIA for a full breakdown and supporting documents of expense claims submitted by MPs under the Parliamentary Additional Costs Allowance scheme. The Commissioner noted that a particular factor taken into account by the Tribunal in that case was that the accountability of MPs is ultimately determined by public vote at the ballot box, for which purpose electors need to be able to make informed choices. We recognise that an assessment of the public interest is of course always fact specific. However, it is self-evident that many of the public interest considerations identified in that case apply in the present case as well. We will not reiterate them all here, but would highlight that just as there is a public interest in understanding the way in which MPs’ allowances are -7-claimed, there is also a public interest in knowing what specific expenditure a former Prime Minister claims from the public purse. Just as with MPs’ expenses, the importance of transparency and accountability is heightened where, as here, the system involves self certification by the persons claiming public money. We do not agree with the Commissioner that the public interest is any the lesser because the information is not needed for the public to exercise a decision at the ballot box. On the contrary, because the allowance is claimed by those no longer holding elected office, and because the allowance can be claimed for the rest of the former Prime Ministers’ lives, whether or not they are engaged in activities that may be perceived to be of public benefit, we consider that the public interest in seeing that the use of public money is appropriate and is properly accounted for, is arguably even greater. 34. For all these reasons, we find that the Disputed Information is not exempt under section 41(1). Having reached this finding, we must go on to consider whether the Disputed Information is exempt under section 40(2). The Commissioner has addressed this in the Decision Notice only in passing (stating that it was likely that the information relating to those individuals alive at the time of the request would also be exempt under section 40(2), and that the legitimate interest in disclosure has largely been met by the publication of the overall figure claimed). The Commissioner has not applied for leave to make further submissions in the event that the Tribunal finds, as we have done, that the Disputed Information is not exempt under section 41(1). Having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 of the The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, and given that we have the benefit of the Cabinet Office’s arguments as they were made to the Commissioner in relation to section 40(2), we consider that we can deal with the issue fairly and justly without having to adjourn to seek the Commissioner’s further submissions, and the Appellant’s further reply. 35. Under section 40(2), personal data of third parties is exempt if disclosure would breach any of the data protection principles set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The exemption is absolute. 36. The Disputed Information clearly constitutes the personal data of the claimants, (the former Prime Ministers). It also contains the personal data of individuals other than the claimants. 37. The question is whether disclosure of this personal data would breach any of the data protection principles. Only the first data protection principle is relevant. This provides that personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully, and in particular, shall not be processed unless at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met. On the facts of this case, the only relevant condition in Schedule 2 is condition 6(1). 38. Condition 6(1) provides as follows: -8-The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 39. The key issues that arises from the first data protection principle, and condition 6(1), is whether disclosure would be fair, whether it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest that is being pursued, and whether it is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects. The first and last of these considerations are closely related. 40. In order to address these issues, we need briefly to describe the Disputed Information, which we consider we can do without trespassing on any content that could be said to engage either of the exemptions relied upon. 41. The Disputed Information relates to 4 former Prime Ministers, namely, Tony Blair, the late Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and Gordon Brown. The quantity of information in respect of each former Prime Minister ranges from 3 to 27 pages. The information includes one former Prime Minister’s bank account details and a personal address. It also includes (though not in all cases), the names of staff who have received payments from the former Prime Ministers’ offices, and the names of some individuals who may have been involved in preparing or submitting the claims on behalf of the former Prime Ministers, as well as individuals at the Cabinet Office who may have been involved in receiving or processing the claims. 42. In addition, there is also an item of personal data in relation to one former Prime Minister’s claim which it will be necessary to describe and deal with in the closed Annex, since to do so in the open part of this decision would effectively involve disclosing that information. 43. To summarise, the personal data in issue is that of the claimants (i.e. the former Prime Ministers), and of certain non-claimants (i.e. staff involved in making or processing the claims, as well as the individuals to whom specific payments have been made). 44. Would disclosure of this personal data be fair? When assessing fairness, the interests of the data subject as well as the data user, and where relevant, the interests of the wider public, must be taken into account in a balancing exercise. This wide approach to fairness is endorsed by the observations of Arden LJ in Johnson v Medical Defence Union [2007] EWCA Civ 262 at paragraph 141: “Recital (28) [of Directive 95/46] states that ""any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the individuals concerned"". I do not consider that this excludes from -9-consideration the interests of the data user. Indeed the very word ""fairness"" suggests a balancing of interests. In this case the interests to be taken into account would be those of the data subject and the data user, and perhaps, in an appropriate case, any other data subject affected by the operation in question.” Although that case concerned the provisions of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, the principles apply equally in relation to FOIA. 45. The following passage in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v IC and Norman Baker MP [2011] 1 Info LR 935 at paragraph 28, also offers guidance about the balancing exercise to be undertaken: “If A makes a request under FOIA for personal data about B, and the disclosure of that personal data would breach any of the data protection principles, then the information is exempt from disclosure under the Act: this follows from section 40(2) read in conjunction with section 40(3)(a)(i), or (when applicable) section 40(3)(b) which does not apply in these appeals. This is an absolute exemption - section 2(3)(f)(ii) FOIA. Hence the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure under section 2(2). However… the application of the data protection principles does involve striking a balance between competing interests, similar to (though not identical with) the balancing exercise that must be carried out in applying the public interest test where a qualified exemption is being considered.” 46. This does not mean, however, that one starts with the scales evenly balanced. The continued primacy of the DPA, notwithstanding freedom of information legislation, and the high degree of protection it affords data subjects has been strongly emphasised by Lord Hope in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] 1 WLR 1550 where he states (at paragraph 7): “In my opinion there is no presumption in favour of the release of personal data under the general obligation that [FOIA] lays down. The references which that Act makes to provisions of DPA 1998 must be understood in the light of the legislative purpose of that Act …. The guiding principle is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.” 47. Where public officials are involved and where the purpose for which the data is processed arises through the performance of a public function, the following passage in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons offers helpful guidance: “…when assessing the fair processing requirements under the DPA … the consideration given to the interests of data subjects, who are public officials where data are processed for a public - 10 -function, is no longer first or paramount. Their interests are still important, but where data subjects carry out public functions, hold elective office or spend public funds they must have the expectation that their public actions will be subject to greater scrutiny than would the case in respect of their private lives. This principle still applies even where a few aspects of their private lives are intertwined with their public lives but where the vast majority of processing of personal data relates to the data subject’s private life.” (paragraph 77): 51. As to whether disclosure is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest, “necessary”, in this context, has been held to reflect the meaning attributed to it by the European Court of Human Rights when justifying an interference with a recognised right, namely that there should be a pressing social need and that interference must be both proportionate as to the means, and fairly balanced as to ends. See Corporate Officer of the House of Commons. More recently, in Farrand v Information Commissioner and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority [2014] UKUT 0310 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal stressed that “necessary” does not mean essential or indispensable. That is too strict a test. Rather, the word connotes a degree of importance or urgency that is lower than absolute necessity, but greater than a mere desire or wish. 48. We return now to the facts of the present case. In our view, different considerations arise when dealing with the personal data of claimants as opposed to the personal data of non-claimants. 49. In relation to the former, apart from the bank account details (the disclosure of which the Appellant accepts would breach the first data protection principle), the Cabinet Office has not given any reason as to why disclosure would be unfair or would otherwise breach the first data protection principle. The total amounts claimed by the former Prime Ministers in any year, is already disclosed. We see no unfairness in disclosure of the breakdown of the claims. We consider that the Appellant is pursuing a legitimate interest (and we note that it has not been argued otherwise), and that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest. We have already discussed the wider public interest at paragraphs 32 and 33, above. We do not find that disclosure is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects. There has been no evidence or arguments put forward by the Cabinet Office in this regard. 50. We consider that the position is quite different, however, in relation to the staff who received payment from the former Prime Ministers’ offices. We find that disclosure of their personal data would not be fair. There is no evidence to indicate that they are public or senior figures, nor indeed are they carrying our public functions. We do not find it likely that it would have been in their reasonable expectation that their personal data would be disclosed. We also consider that any legitimate interest in their personal data is tenuous. The Appellant has argued, and persuasively in our view, as to the public interest in the breakdown of the expenditure. - 11 -While we accept that for the information to be meaningful, the breakdown should be disclosed by reference to what the expenditure was for (to the extent that that is reflected in the Disputed Information), in the absence of any suggestion of impropriety, we do not consider that there is a legitimate interest in disclosure of the identity of the individuals to whom payment has been made. While it may be fair to say that anyone paid from the public purse should expect some information about such payments to be public, there is no suggestion that these are individuals holding any positions of responsibility or seniority such that any legitimate interest there may be, would outweigh the prejudice to their rights and freedoms that would arise if their identities or salaries were to be disclosed. We accept the argument made by the Cabinet Office that redacting or anonymising their names alone, may not be sufficient, and that the amount each member of staff was paid must also be redacted. Given the small number of staff involved, disclosure of the amount paid to any individual, when taken together with information already in the public domain, or which could be ascertained without much difficulty, may lead to the identities of those individuals and what they have been paid, becoming known. 51. There is even less legitimate interest in knowing the identity of the staff involved in making or processing the claims, except where their seniority is such that we consider it would be both within their likely expectation that their involvement would be disclosed. We consider that there is a legitimate public interest in knowing that senior figures have been involved in the making or processing of such claims. For the avoidance of doubt, we would say that in reaching our findings, we have considered the seniority of the individuals in question where this has been self- evident from their titles, but not where there has been no evidence before us as to their seniority. 52. Different considerations apply when those making or processing the claims were acting in a professional capacity, whether as individuals, or as part of accounting or other professional services firms. We consider that in such cases, disclosure of their identities and the nature of their involvement would be fair. We consider that it would have been in their reasonable expectation, that the fact and nature of their professional involvement, would fall to be disclosed, and further that there is a legitimate public interest in knowing where professionals have been involved in the making or processing of such claims because of what that may indicate about how such claims were dealt with by the former Prime Ministers. 53. For all these reasons, we find that: (1) that part of the Disputed Information which comprises the personal data of the four former Prime Ministers is not exempt under section 40(2), and must be disclosed, except for any bank account details; (2) that part of the Disputed Information which comprises the personal data of the staff who received payment from the individual former Prime - 12 -Ministers’ offices is exempt under section 40(2), and should be redacted as further specified in the Open Annex and Confidential Annex; and (3) that part of the Disputed Information which comprises the personal data of other individuals involved in making or processing the claims is exempt under section 40(2) in some cases, and should be redacted as further specified in the Open Annex and the Confidential Annex, but is not exempt in other cases. 54. The Public Authority must also disclose to the Appellant the unredacted letter from Roger Smethurst dated 18 March 2015, which appears as the first item in the closed bundle. The redacted portions of that letter do not disclose any personal data which we find to be exempt. Indeed, it simply describes the Disputed Information in general terms. We see no reason why that information should have been redacted from that letter at all. Decision 55. The Appellant’s appeal is allowed in part. 56. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Date: 23 November 2016 Anisa Dhanji Judge * Certain changes were made to the decision on 21 March 2016 before promulgation in order to take account of concerns raised by the Cabinet Office that the open part of the decision disclosed some Disputed Information. ** The Cabinet Office was not a party to this appeal. Following promulgation of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”), the Cabinet Office applied to be joined as a party. That application was allowed on 21 April 2016 by the President of the General Regulatory Chamber. On 20 May 2016, the Cabinet Office made an application for permission to appeal the FTT’s decision to the Upper Tribunal, or in the alternative, for the FTT to set aside its decision under Rule 44 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009. The application was made on various grounds. By a decision dated 10 October 2016, the application was refused on all grounds except that the FTT agreed to review the decision on one point only, namely, whether the steps as set out in the Confidential Annex would be effective to provide anonymity in relation to non-claimants (the “Review Question”). In deciding the Review Question, we have considered the arguments made by the Cabinet Office in its application for permission to appeal and in the further submissions made by the Cabinet Office, and by Mr Webber. No further submissions have been received from the Information Commissioner. Some of the submissions from Mr Webber go beyond the Review Question. He argues, for example, against the finding that we had made that to disclose the personal data of non-claimants would breach the first data protection principle. This is outside the scope of the Review Question. As a result of the review, paragraphs 50 to 53, inclusive, of the decision are new or have been revised. There has been no change to paragraphs 1 to 49, inclusive. The content of the former paragraphs 52 to 54, inclusive, have not been changed, except for their numbering. - 13 -There is a new Open Annex, and paragraph 2 of the Confidential Annex has been revised. Open Annex 1. We have attached, as part of the Confidential Annex, the documents comprising the Disputed Information showing the specific redactions to be made. Where there is more than one page with similar type of information, we have included only one page to serve as an example. 2. This Annex provides brief explanations about the redactions to be made. We have adopted, for this purpose, the Cabinet Office’s approach to referring to the former Prime Ministers as Tony Blair, by name, and the others as Prime Ministers A, B and C. The page numbers refer to the closed bundle of 45 pages comprising the Disputed Information. Tony Blair 3. The Disputed Information comprises 4 pages, and includes a single invoice showing the total claim made for a specific year. 4. The following information should be redacted: <U+F0B7> the name, e mail address, and phone number of the member of staff at the Cabinet Office on page 8; <U+F0B7> the bank account details on pages 10 and 11; and <U+F0B7> the name which appears on pages 10 and 11 in connection with the bank account details. 5. The name of the person at the Cabinet Office on page 10 to whom the invoice is addressed should not be redacted. We consider that given his seniority, disclosure would not be unfair, and we also consider that there is a legitimate public interest in knowing the level at which these claims are handled. Prime Minister A 6. The Disputed Information comprises 4 pages (pages 12 -15, although page 15 appears to be a duplicate of page 13). It includes two invoices. 7. The names of the staff members, their salary and national insurance pay and total pay should be redacted. Although we consider that given the very small number of staff, their names and the amounts they were paid should be redacted to provide anonymity, the total amounts paid to the staff should not be redacted. This information would not involve disclosure of personal data, except to the theoretical and very limited extent of disclosing the maximum such individuals would have been paid, if their identities are known. We consider that any such very limited disclosure would be outweighed by the public interest in knowing the total amount claimed by former Prime Minister A for staff salaries. - 14 -8. The name of the individual who signed each form (pages 12 and 13) should not be redacted. We consider that there is a legitimate public interest in knowing the seniority of those involved in submitting and approving these claims. The signature on page 12 is likely to be in the public domain. However, the signature at page 13 should be redacted. There is no legitimate public interest in disclosure of the signature given that the name is being disclosed. However, that individual’s address at page 14 should be redacted since it is unclear whether it is a personal address. We consider that there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure of a personal address. 9. At page 14, the signature should be redacted. However, for the reasons set out at paragraph 52 of the decision, the names of professionals providing services to the offices of the former prime ministers should not be redacted. Prime Minister B 10. The Disputed Information comprises 3 pages (pages 16 -18), showing the salary and national insurance contributions paid in respect of each staff member, for each month. As with Prime Minister A, given the very small number of staff, their names and the amounts paid in respect of salary and national insurance should be redacted to provide anonymity. However, for the same reasons as set out above in respect of Prime Minister A, the total amounts paid to the staff in each month should be disclosed. 11. We have indicated, in the Confidential Annex, the redactions by reference to a single month. This is by way of example. The same redactions should be made throughout. Prime Minister C 12. The Disputed comprises 26 pages (pages 19 - 45). It shows the salary and national insurance contributions paid in respect of each staff member for each month. It also shows the percentage of each staff member’s gross pay that is recoverable from the PDCA, and the total amount due from the PDCA. 13. For the same reasons as set out above, the names of the staff and the specific amounts of their individual pay should be redacted. However, the total amounts for all staff should be provided as a means of providing the information that we consider is necessary for the public interest, without disclosing personal data. 14. We have indicated, in the Confidential Annex, the redactions and the totals to be provided, by reference to a single month. This is by way of example. The same redactions should be made and totals provided throughout for all 26 pages. - 15 -"

"36","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) EA/2015/0049 BRYAN WELLS Appellant And THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Hearing Held on 6 September 2016 at Field House.1 Before Jean Nelson, David Wilkinson and Judge Taylor. Decision The appeal succeeds in part. The reasons for this decision are out below and in the Closed Appendix2. This decision is to be treated as a substituted Decision Notice. Steps to be taken Within twenty working days of the date of promulgation of this decision, the Environment Agency is required to disclosed the information set out in the Appendix to this Decision. 1 The matter was heard by consideration of the papers without an oral hearing. 2 Part of the Appendix to this decision has been redacted because it discloses the contents of the requested information. It is therefore categorized as a ‘Closed Appendix’. 1Reasons Background3 1. On 17 November 1997, the Appellant’s sole water supply was contaminated following the spraying of slurry by a neighbouring farm. The Appellant complained that this caused serious problems for him and his family and the operation of his farm. 2. Prior to this event, the EA had been involved in approving the neighbour’s farm waste management plan to which the slurry distribution system related. 3. On 18 November 1997, the Environment Agency (‘EA’) started its investigation relating to the complaint of pollution. The Appellant made two further complaints of contamination on 18 January and 6 March 1998 where the EA found no discharge occurring at the time of investigation. The EA decided not to prosecute anyone and ensured a review of the plan. 4. For some time, the Appellant has wanted to see information on the dealings between the EA and the individual who then owned the neighbouring farm. From 2006 to 2012, he made a number of ‘subject access requests’ under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the ‘DPA’). Not satisfied with the response, he subsequently complained to the Information Commissioner (‘Commissioner’). The subject access requests are not a matter for this appeal. The Request 5. On the 7 October 2013, the Appellant requested from the EA: “all documents held by the EA relating to the groundwater pollution incident caused by low pressure irrigation of effluents and slurry occurring in late 1997”. 6. On 17 October 2013, the EA refused to disclose the information relying on the exception set out in regulation 13(1) EIR (personal data). Matters progressed with the Commissioner investigating the Appellant’s complaint. In his Decision Notice (Ref. FER0539292), the Commissioner found that the EA had correctly relied on regulation 13(1) so as to withhold the information where it considered the requested material to be personal data of a sole trader. 7. The Appellant now appeals this decision. The Task of the Tribunal 8. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’). This applies to environmental information appeals as a result of regulation 18 of The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘EIR’). This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the 3 See pages 234 to 239 of the Open Bundle. 2Commissioner is in accordance with the law, or, where the decision involved exercising discretion, whether it should have been exercised differently. 9. The Tribunal is independent of the Commissioner, and considers afresh the Appellant’s complaint. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and make different findings of fact. 10. In this case, our remit is limited to considering whether the EA complied with requirements as a public authority under EIR in responding to his request. Any other matters raised by the Appellant - such as the regulatory powers of the EA and questions he has raised as to the lawfulness of their actions; what material the Commissioner considered - are beyond our remit. We make our decision on the basis of the material and submissions presented to us. 11. We have received an ‘open’ bundle of documents and a set of ‘additional open documents’ containing submissions and evidence as well as the ‘closed’ bundle containing the requested information. We have considered all of these even if not specifically referred to below. The Law 12. Broadly speaking, the EIR is legislation governing an individual’s right to access information from a public authority where it is ‘environmental information’. Environmental information is defined in regulation 2(1) to include: “any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; (b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements”. 13. The parties agree that the relevant legislation to consider in this appeal is the EIR because the request relates to a groundwater pollution incident and the measures and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements. 14. Public authorities are under a general duty under the EIR to disclose information where it is requested under regulation 5. However, regulations 12 and 13 provide exceptions to that duty, including in relation to information that is personal data. 15. Personal data is defined in s.1(1) DPA as: 3“data which relate to a living individual who can be identified - from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller..” 16. So far is relevant here, Regulation 13 states: “13(1) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject and as respects which either the first or second condition below is satisfied, a public authority shall not disclose the personal data. (2) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under these Regulations would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles…” 17. The first ‘data protection principle’ has been identified in this appeal as of relevance. This provides that: “1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless - (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met...“ (See para. 1 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (‘DPA’)’ (Emphasis added) 18. The only condition in Schedule 2 DPA that may be of relevance in these circumstances is where the disclosure is: ‘necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.’ (See para 6, Sch. 2 DPA). Issues 19. The Appellant has submitted extensive grounds of appeal. In short, the questions for the Tribunal relate to whether the EA has correctly relied on regulation 13(1) so as to withhold the information, namely: A. Is the Requested Information Personal Data? B. Would disclosing it contravene the first data protection principle? A. Is the Requested Information Personal Data? 20. If the information is not personal data, then the EA cannot rely on the exception set out in regulation 13(1) EIR so as to withhold the information. 421. The Commissioner’s submissions on the point include the following: A. The disputed information comprises records of conversations between an identifiable individual and the Environment Agency, and correspondence between the Agency and that individual. B. Personal data is defined under section 1(1) DPA as data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information which is in the possession of the data controller or is likely to come into the possession of the data controller. Therefore, even if the person’s name were redacted, the remaining information would still constitute the individual's personal data. C. Information may relate to an individual in a business capacity and not just to their private life. As such, information about the business of a sole trader will amount to personal data as information about the business will be about the sole trader. D. The Appellant is aware of the identity of the person involved in the incident and confirms that his interest concerns the actions of the EA in relation to the investigation and subsequent findings of the pollution incident. 22. The Appellant’s only argument on this point relates to whether the individual concerned in the incident was a sole trader or partner of a partnership. The point is not relevant for our purposes. This is because when considering whether the Appellant’s request for information concerned ‘personal data’, we must consider whether the information is about or relates to an identifiable individual.4 On the facts, regardless of whether the relevant person was a sole trader or partner, he is an identifiable individual for the purpose of the DPA. In other words, whilst the Commissioner may or may not have incorrectly described the relevant individual as a sole trader makes no material difference to our decision, and we do not need to make a finding as to whether he was a sole trader or partner. In either case, he is an individual and we must determine whether the requested information is his personal data. We do not consider the argument further. Our Findings 23. We have reviewed the requested information, and consider that it is personal data. This is because the redacted material contains information about individuals, principally but not exclusively the individual involved in the incident. 24. To the extent that the individuals’ names and identifying details are redacted, the material will still remain the personal data of the person involved in the incident. This is because the Appellant will still be able to identify him from the requested information as he is already ‘in possession of’ his name. (See para.15 above.) 25. The Commissioner argues that even if the material relates to an individual’s business rather than personal activities it can still be personal in nature. We 4 See paragraph 15 above. 5accept this. We consider that given the nature of the incident, the complaint made by the Appellant and subsequent investigation by the EA (exercising its regulatory powers in relation to the individual’s activities), the requested material is personal in nature and personal data within the meaning of the DPA. B. Would disclosing it contravene the first data protection principle? 26. The Commissioner’s submissions on the point include the following: Legitimate expectations A. There is a greater expectation of disclosure in relation to information about an individual's business as opposed to his private life, particularly where a regulator is involved. B. However, on the facts of this case, the individual had a reasonable expectation that their correspondence and dealings with the EA would not be disclosed: a. The EA had explained that individuals whose activities fell within its regulatory powers had a reasonable expectation that information they provided in relation to those matters would be kept confidential. As a result any such disclosure of the information requested is likely to have distressing consequences to the individual concerned. b. The EA had not pursued a prosecution. c. The matter settled from the point of view of the regulator and the individual concerned. d. The individual involved would not reasonably expect the EA to disclose such dealings more than fifteen years later. Public Interest C. The public interest in disclosure did not outweigh the rights of the individual because a. The information was purely of historical interest. The incident occurred more than 15 years ago, and did not warrant significant action by the regulator at the time. b. There was a general public interest in disclosure of information relating to serious pollution incidents that resulted in criminal prosecutions, but not here. The Appellant's claim that the information remains relevant to existing and future water supplies in the local area was not supported by evidence. c. There was no evidence presented to suggest that information about the 1997 pollution incident was pertinent to current issues or that a present danger was posed by the land in question or likely to recur. 6d. Disclosure under the EIR is disclosure to the world at large. e. The Appellant's interest in the disputed information appears to be personal, given the focus on issues relating to an insurance claim and other potential legal action in his submissions. The personal interest did not translate into a wider public interest in disclosure to the world at large. 27. The Appellant’s submissions are lengthy and not repeated here. They include: a. “The information asked for is plainly about a matter that is now seen as rotten to the core with secrecy and clandestine dealings that covered up the truth. From the full history of correspondence it can also be seen that the EA was involved in the approval of a waste disposal plan at the concept and planning stage of affairs with the business.” b. “The EA investigator suggested the Farm Waste Management Plan as a means to control what was going on the day after the pollution incident. Significantly the investigator knew of the plan’s existence and by then obviously aware of its limitations and failure.” c. “The approval of the Farm Waste Management Plan [‘FWMP’] was at the root cause of failure and the fundamental error that lead to a cascade of further errors leading to disaster and deceit. I was of course barred from seeing the original FWMP and despite three formal FOI Information requests specifically related to the FWMP I am obliged to accept the position in relation to access of a plan formulated before the disaster.” d. “My level of trust in the intentions of the EA and the EA Corporate Security to provide the true records and full truth was destroyed the day I found out that the true cause of the pollution incident had been improperly denied and covered up for four years. The refusals to supply further detail and confirmation at that point was inexcusable and a despicable action. It was flagrant abuse and breach of trust. Trust was further demolished when the IC made clear that the EA had engaged in private dealings with the offenders to the obvious detriment of the victims in the disaster. It was a clandestine and discriminatory action covered up until recently exposed as private dealings and described as such by the IC.” e. “The EA action by letter to my MP and the Solicitor that listed reasons for not prosecuting the offenders and plainly deliberately omitted to reveal the true cause is the contemptable part of the whole affair. It was an inexcusable failure to tell the truth. The letters, however, make clear that the EA had approved the farm waste management plan at concept stage and the omission of the true cause of the pollution incident is conspicuously absent. They should be compelled to provide all the files under caution for complete disclosure.” 7f. “No government body should have the power to make decisions and undertake clandestine actions and thereafter use the information regulations in an inappropriate way to cover up actions taken to the detriment of victims in a pollution disaster. Decisions and actions of a public body should be without discrimination and accountable. It follows that the results of any EA incident investigations as to cause of a pollution incident with life changing effects should be made available to the victims without the necessity of formal FOI requests, legal costs and years of disruption and delay.” g. “I question the right of the EA to make a decision in favour of removing prosecution at the expense of the victims in the disaster, and then place a restraint on information as to cause.” h. “Under no circumstances should the irrigation of effluent and slurry have been in operation during winter months over saturated ground and in a spring collection area. No consideration had been given to the existence and location of the spring collection area nor the spring egression point and the supply of water for human consumption that had been in use for perhaps a hundred years or more. The EA approved the plan and they failed in a duty of care to members of the public. Overall it was a bad error of judgement that failed to consider the consequences of their actions. The attempts to pass responsibility back to the business is overridden by the fact that the EA approved a plan that was flawed. The EA negligently gave approval and failed to give essential guidance and correction to the business at the time of plan conception. They failed to make reasonable and proper investigation of the circumstances on site. Pollution was inevitably going to occur when the ground became saturated from winter rainfall and effluent then passed to a spring outfall. The document had been submitted to the EA for approval and approval had been given. Within the event in question it has become clear that during the irrigation of effluent and slurry in the spring collection area the equipment suffered a mechanical breakdown which caused saturation and the inevitable pollution to the groundwater. This was the information buried by the EA following private dealings with the offenders and remained secret for four years until that part of the truth emerged. Seen and considered now of course, prosecution for the offence would inescapably have been complicated with the involvement of the EA in the approval of the waste disposal scheme at conception…” i. “…the blatant denial of information as to cause and required for recovery of damages and insurance cover is something that should never be repeated. Both information as to cause and actions of the EA should be available, on request, to the victims of pollution disaster immediately following the regulators decision not to prosecute. Nobody should be subjected to the demands and delays of having to seek this information via FOI or EIR channels.” 8j. “In my view the victims in a man-made disaster should not be placed at disadvantage through denial of information by the regulator – the EA… The denial of information described was obviously a block on recovery of damages through court and insurance proceedings and is plainly wrongful and unacceptable. ” k. “When the inevitable disaster struck, the EA affiliated with the business representatives and engaged in private dealings and in so doing placed those suffering damage at further disadvantage by not disclosing the actual cause of the pollution. Obviously the private dealings and remedial measures that the IC has referred to in his decision included a revision to the FWMP. This was no doubt the principle part of the offer in exchange for no prosecution. By engaging in secret dealings they demonstrated a callous disregard for the wellbeing of those already at disadvantage and suffering the loss of water supply. It was a calculated insensitive decision with immediate and long term damaging influence.“ l. “It is my intention that the history of all the information enquiries (together with the associated correspondence) will demonstrate that the response from the regulators was confined to the default use of rights of the individual representing the business and throughout with complete avoidance of dealing with the demands for information about the actions of the EA… Significantly the IC has condoned these actions by accepting and ruling that the regulators have done nothing wrong” m. “I do feel that the argument put up by the IC using the rights and freedoms of the individual representing the business is unbalanced because the rights and freedoms of the victims are totally overlooked and not considered. The temerity of the situation is plain to see.” Our Findings 28. Having found that the requested material is personal data, we must consider whether its disclosure would breach an of the data protection principles. In particular, the Commissioner has been concerned with the first data protection principle, which states that personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and not disclosed unless one of the conditions is met. 29. The condition cited as of relevance here states that disclosure must be ‘necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.’ (See para 6, Sch. 2 DPA). 30. Accordingly, we must first consider if the disclosure is ‘necessary’ for the purpose of the interests pursued by those to whom the information would be disclosed. 9(i) What are the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed? 31. The Commissioner argues that the interest must be a public rather than private interest for the purpose of this condition because disclosure under EIR is presumed to be a disclosure to the world at large. On a reading of the legislation, this is not necessarily so, given that the world at large cannot be said to be pursuing that the material be disclosed. However, regardless of whether the Commissioner’s position is correct the strongest interests identified in the Appellant’s case for disclosure and the only ones to which we would give weight seem to us to be both his private and the public’s interests. The first is a general interest in transparency and accountability of a public authority. In particular, there would be value in knowing how effective, efficient and fair the EA were in dealing with an incident of contaminated water supply, including in deciding whether or not to prosecute the individual or individuals concerned. It is accepted that the incident was some time ago such that the interest may be weaker than it was, however the Appellant’s focus at the time of this appeal is with the EA’s discharge of its responsibilities as a public authority following the incident. Notwithstanding the nature of his interest, we have no reason to accept, and certainly do not accept, the Appellant’s strong assumption of wrongdoing by the EA, as evidenced in the quotations at paragraph 27 above. The second interest is in the Appellant and other farmers being able to find out the details and causes of incidents affecting their property. There is a strong interest in this being known speedily after the event. Over time, this interest may also diminish, and we think it has done so here. We consider that whilst both interests have diminished with time, they nonetheless still carry some weight. 32. We accept that the incident did not result in a criminal prosecution, that it is plausible that the requested information is not relevant to existing and future water supplies in the local area or pertinent to current issues. We do not accept the Appellant's interest in the disputed information is focused on an insurance claim and other potential legal action, as the Appellant denies this and stating that it is too late to make such a claim. However, this does not detract from the interests we have identified in paragraph 31 above. (ii) Is disclosure necessary? 33. The case of Farrand v the Information Commissioner and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority [2014] UKUT 0310 (AAC) instructs us at para. 27 that the word necessary “connotes a degree of importance or urgency that is lower than absolute necessity but greater than a mere desire or wish.” 34. We have noted that the requested material includes both the personal data of the individual involved in the incident (‘category A’) as well as of other individuals (‘category B’). The personal data that is category B consists of certain identifiers such as a person’s name, which it is not necessary to disclose for the interests identified in paragraph 31 above. Accordingly, we find that the category B information should be withheld (as described in the Closed Appendix) and do not consider it further below. 1035. Once the category B information is redacted, the remaining material is all category A, namely the personal data of the individual involved in the incident. We consider that disclosure of this information is necessary for the interests identified in the paragraph above, notwithstanding that the information is historic in nature. (iii) What are the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? Would disclosure be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to these rights, freedoms and interests? 36. We then consider whether disclosure of the category A information is unwarranted because of it would prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. In assessing this, we take into account that the disclosure under EIR is considered to be a disclosure to the world at large and not only to the Appellant. We consider whether there are rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the individual concerned in the incident and whether disclosure would be unwarranted because of the prejudice to such rights and freedoms or legitimate interests.5 37. We accept that the relevant individual was running a business and that there is a greater expectation of disclosure in relation to information about an individual's business as opposed to his private life. Having reviewed the material in detail, we consider that the individual would have had a reasonable expectation to privacy of some of the material but not other parts by virtue of the nature of that information, as explained in the Closed Appendix to this decision. 38. As regards Category A, some of the requested information should be redacted in accordance with the Closed Appendix. This is because disclosure of this material is unwarranted where the relevant individual had a reasonable expectation that it would be kept confidential. We consider this reason to be sufficient in itself, but also accept the further factors would additionally indicate withholding the information: a. The EA had not pursued a prosecution. b. The matter had been settled from the point of view of the regulator and the individual concerned. c. The individual involved would not reasonably expect the EA to disclose such dealings more than fifteen years later. (‘the further factors’). 39. We find that certain of the information identified in the Closed Appendix should be disclosed. This is because we do not consider it to be of sufficient a personal nature for the relevant individual to have such an expectation of keeping the information confidential as to make the disclosure unwarranted, having taken into account both the further factors and also the interests identified in paragraph 31 above. 5 See para. 29 of the Upper Tribunal decision of Information Commissioner v (1) CF and (2) Nursing and Midwifery Council (Information rights : Data protection) [2015] UKUT 449 (AAC) (10 August 2015). 1140.

"37","Procedural Refusal","Neutral Citation Number: IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: 2EA/2016/0114 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS)ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50593659 Dated: 31 March 2016 Appellant: Krystyna Sullivan Respondent: The Information Commissioner Heard at: Edinburgh Date of Hearing: 17 August 2016 Before Chris Hughes Judge and Marion Saunders and Suzanne Cosgrave Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 30 August 2016 Attendances: For the Appellant: in person For the Respondent: did not attend Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000 Environmental Information Regulations 2004 Cases: Information Commissioner v Devon County Council & Dransfield UKUT 440 (AAC), 28 January 2013 Dransfield v Information Commissioner and another Craven v Information Commissioner and anotherAppeal No: EA/20** [2015] EWCA Civ 454; [2015] WLR (D) 215 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 31 March 2016 and dismisses the appeal. 2Appeal No: EA/20** REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in these proceedings (Mrs Sullivan) believes that she is entitled to inherit property from her late father. Over time she has come to believe that that this is a considerable estate. She states that at present she is unable to apply for probate until she is able to construct a paper trail. She told the tribunal “my quest in trying to get the documentation together to proceed to a grant of probate is what it is all about to me.” 2. Following correspondence with Land and Property Services (“LPS” a section of the Department of Finance and Personnel “DFP”, a part of the Northern Ireland Executive responsible, among other things for rating valuations and land registration) she was asked to formally make an information request for what she was seeking. On 19 June 2015 at 9.27 am she wrote:- “Freedom of Information Act 2000/Data Protection Act 1998 Thank you for your letter dated 15th June in connection with In House Document No. 2000/25224. I hereby request that all Documents and Information protected by the above Act and relating to the said “In House Document No.2000/25224” be released to me as a matter of urgency.” 3. At 12.04 that day she chased for an acknowledgement by email and spoke by telephone at 2.25 pm, sending a further email at 3.52pm. She received a letter by email at 4.40pm and further information was sent to her at 4.49pm. The substantive response was made on 23 July and stated:- “The information you have requested is withheld under Section 40(2) (data protection) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as it concerns a third party.” 4. On review the position adopted was upheld and information as to the nature of the information requested was provided (letter dated 12 August 2015 bundle pages 48 - 50):- 3Appeal No: EA/20** “My investigations reveal that the “in-house document number 2000/25224 is not in fact a document. The reference is a number generated by the LPS systems when customers request data from those systems. This number therefore refers to an individual who has in the past made a legitimate request for information from Land and Property Services. In making that transaction, the individual would not expect his/her details to be made public by LPS, which is the effect of any release under the FOIA. To publish that person’s details would be unfair and so would breach the first Data Protection principle.” 5. Mrs Sullivan complained to the Respondent , the Information Commissioner (“ICO”). He investigated and wrote to LPS on 9 December (bundle pages 73-75 ) and 29 January querying reliance on the Data Protection Act on the basis that the applicant for information was a firm of solicitors and that the name of a firm was not personal data. In response LPS (letter dated 10 February, bundle pages 93-95) relied on the S14 of FOIA on the basis that the request was repetitious and vexatious. The reply noted that:- “Our records show that Mrs Sullivan emailed the business area 138 times concerning this issue alone…. The recorded email traffic does not, however, bear witness to the prolific number of phone calls which accompanied these communications. In Registration, one member of staff agreed to be a single point of contact to deal with Mrs Sullivan exclusively, as other members of staff felt harassed by her frequent telephoning, emailing and impatience (her complaint case was about perceived “tardiness”). Although Mrs Sullivan has always been polite, nonetheless officials have found the level of persistence distressing. From this amount of contact, especially the number of requests to Registration for folios on parcels of land that Mrs Sullivan is not legal owner of, it could be argued that the request is evidence of a pattern of behaviour. … The disclosure of the information would, or would be likely to, place the third party at risk of unwarranted attention – the requestor’s history of action in this case has been one whereby she has repeatedly contacted DFP and NI Assembly Committee staff and members. Both Complaints Unit and IMU staff, as well as Land Registration staff in LPS, have received numerous calls and e-mails from Mrs Sullivan in the course of 4Appeal No: EA/20** processing her request for information. For example, when the request was sent by email, within minutes she phoned for an acknowledgement of receipt and e-mailing repeatedly for an acknowledgement e-mail in a way in which no one else has acted. If we were to disclose the third party’s name and address they might face similar excessive contact from the requestor. … There is no public interest in releasing into the public domain the name and address of a solicitor who obtained a copy of the folio for a client. The requestor is able to obtain the name and address of any parties who own or have owned the land in the folio by herself purchasing a copy of the folio, without needing to know who represented them as a solicitor in a conveyance. There is no public interest in releasing into the public domain the name and address of the solicitor who obtained a copy of the folio for a client, for to do so would create a precedent that the names and addresses of any or all solicitors doing so might be made public and that would create an unwelcome lack of trust between LPS and solicitors representing clients in a confidential legal capacity for clients. There is no public interest in releasing into the public domain the name and address of a solicitor who obtained a copy of the folio for a client, as the issue is clearly purely a personal matter on the part of the requestor and the public would not benefit in any way from the release of this information. It is unlikely to requestor's case would benefit from the release of the information. Conclusion This request represents a burden on the Department, in that LPS considers that dealing with this request has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, a disproportionate level of disruption, irritation and, to some staff members, distress. The requestor’s contact with the Department, both evidenced by the e-mails on Trim and the undocumented telephone calls, amounts to unreasonable persistence and obsessive behaviour. Much of the information Mrs Sullivan has sought she has been able to obtain through Land Registration as it is available in the public domain. Despite this, the way Mrs Sullivan has dealt with officials has been unusually repetitious and vexatious. The 5Appeal No: EA/20** pattern of the requester's behaviour in dealing with LPS staff in general gives cause for concern and suggests that it is unlikely the Department will be able to resolve her [re]quest to her satisfaction.” 6. In his decision notice the ICO considered the matter under the Environmental Information Regulations rather than FOIA, however he noted that there was no material difference between the two statutory access regimes where the issue was whether a request was manifestly unreasonable (dn paragraphs 17-18). 7. He reviewed the position of the Department (dn paragraphs 22-26). He noted (dn paragraphs 27 & 29) the breadth of the material which Mrs Sullivan had sent him:- “This includes correspondence with the Department in respect of other requests for information, correspondence with a bank and correspondence with the Financial Ombudsman Service. …. The complainant has not specifically addressed the Department’s assessment of her request as vexatious. Nor has she provided any arguments as to why the requested information would be of value to the wider public. However the complainant maintains that the requested information is necessary for her own legal case."" 8. The ICO, relying on the decision in Dransfield considered the issue to be:- “Does the request have a value or serious purpose in terms of the objective public interest in the information sought?” 9. He noted the good faith of Mrs Sullivan in seeking information and her belief that it would help her probate case, however (dn 31):- …, The Commissioner is unable to identify an objective public interest in the public being informed as to the name of a solicitors’ firm that requested a copy of a particular folio. In any event it is not clear to the Commissioner how the requested information itself would assist the complainant’s case in practical terms” 10. He accepted the submissions of the department and concluded (dn paragraph 42):- 6Appeal No: EA/20** ""The Commissioner recognises that the Department has already sought to address the complainant’s issues, and has tried to explain to the complainant that the information she has requested would not in fact assist her personal interest. The Commissioner is satisfied that the public interest in maintaining the exception at regulation 12(4)(b) clearly outweighs the public interest in complying with the request.” 11. In her appeal Mrs Sullivan described the information she required as:- ""the two documents, namely 2000/25224 and 2000/25524 (the subject of my FOIA request) are the missing links in the paper trail surrounding folio 1380”. She identified no errors of law and advanced no arguments why the ICO was incorrect in his decision merely restating that she believed that she required the information in connection with her late father's estate. 12. In his response the ICO maintained the position set out in the decision notice, noted the considerable burden upon the department and that a similar burden would also fall upon the solicitors’ firms who had applied for copies of the land folios ""since it is likely that the Appellant would begin excessive correspondence with them.” He concluded that there was ""a strong public interest in the protection of the Department's resources, and little public interest in disclosure”. 13. In support of her appeal Mrs Sullivan submitted what she claimed was a witness statement by a Gregory McCambridge whom she stated was a member of the Bar of Northern Ireland and who was acting as a legal adviser in all these matters. The tribunal noted that the document was in a somewhat unusual form, in the same unusual typeface that Mrs Sullivan uses, and contained a number of strange assertions including claiming that NAMA (the National Asset Management Agency which was set up by the government of the Irish Republic as part of its response to the financial crisis) lacked the legal capacity to receive money from the sale of property in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It may be noted that there is no such individual at the Bar of Northern Ireland. Mrs Sullivan is either being misled and may be being provided with highly unreliable guidance by this individual or is confused. 14. Mrs Sullivan also relied on a certificate dated 24 June 1983 from the Probate Division of the High Court of Northern Ireland. This she claimed was a receipt of payment of £15,000 paid by the Government of Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic. A simple 7Appeal No: EA/20** inspection of the documents (bundle page 47) shows that is not correct. It is a certificate by the Examiner of the Capital Taxes Office in Belfast showing that the estate of the late Bernard McDonagh who died on the 3 February 1937 was valued at £15,000 and no estate duty was payable on the estate. Again Mrs Sullivan was confused. 15. In the oral proceedings Mrs Sullivan was unable to advance any argument relating to public interest and was simply focused on her own beliefs as to the existence of a substantial estate to which she would be entitled if she could obtain a grant of probate. She was unable to explain why she was unable to apply for probate now on the basis of listing and valuing the properties. 16. She saw no difficulty in the repeated contact with the Department saying ""in the real world you have to be prepared to act instantly”. She did not see her frequent contact as being repetitive and vexatious. She confirmed that she had ""almost 60 folios which I got from Land Registration all connected to my father”. She confirmed that she had obtained a copy of folio 1380. She stated that her interest was not “in the name and address of the solicitor but in the document 2000/25524.” (She acknowledged that the similarity in the numbering of the documents requested had been a source of confusion but there was no issue arising from that). She did not accept the explanation that this was a reference number rather than a document. She stated that ""my legal adviser was of the opinion that this document holds evidence which connects to my late father's estate”. She also asserted that the requested information not only were documents and not as LPS had advised a number generated by the LPS system but they “have been used as collateral to obtain money from Banks in Northern Ireland”.(letter 1 August 2016) 17. In the weeks preceding the tribunal she had submitted a number of documents to the tribunal and stated that ""the paper trail accompanying all areas listed here was new information”. She had submitted a transcript of a television documentary about the work of NAMA which she felt was highly relevant to her request. She stated that she had been in touch with NAMA and that they had denied any liability to her. Legal analysis and conclusion 18. The tribunal reminded itself that the issue it had to consider was whether or not the department had been entitled to rely on EIR regulation 12 (4)(b) which allowed it to 8Appeal No: EA/20** refuse a request for information if it was manifestly unreasonable. In considering this question the tribunal reviewed to the arguments advanced by the Department and the analysis of the situation set out in the ICO's decision notice. The tribunal noted that the department had expended considerable effort in responding to Mrs Sullivan's requests, this had caused some distress to “members of staff who felt harassed by her frequent telephoning, emailing and impatience” so that they had had to put in place a single point of contact to try and control the flow of communications from Mrs Sullivan, Mrs Sullivan has pursued multiple routes of contact and was pursuing similar activities with a range of agencies. The tribunal noted that at no stage had Mrs Sullivan advanced any argument as to the public interest and had always simply reiterated her belief that this information was necessary to advance what can only be seen as a private interest, obtaining a grant of probate. It is clear from her interpretation and use of documents that Mrs Sullivan is confused as to certain issues and there is, as the Department and ICO noted, no real explanation as to how the information could conceivably advance her private interest. 19. The tribunal was satisfied that the ICO’s decision notice was for all practical purposes correct in law and dismissed the appeal. 20. The tribunal noted the ICO’s reliance on EIR and considered that this was flawed and that the information held could not remotely be considered a measure"" likely to affect the state of the environment”. As the Court of Appeal in Dransfield CA and Arden LJ concluded that the difference between “vexatiousness” FOIA s14 and “manifestly unreasonable” EIR reg 12(4)(b) was” vanishingly small” and the Upper Tier Tribunal’s conclusion that there was no difference between the tests was not overturned. so the tribunal is satisfied that the analysis of the situation under the EIR undertaken by the ICO in paras 30 -39 would also justify the decision that s14 is engaged under FOIA and the request is vexatious. 21. The tribunal notes that EIR reg 12(4)(b) (in contrast to FOIA s14) requires a public interest test which is carefully described by the ICO in dn paras 40 – 42 which it supports. 22. Our decision is unanimous. 9Appeal No: EA/20** Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 30 August 2016 10"

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Mr Martin Newbold (the “Appellant”), against a decision notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 14 December 2015. 2. Mr Newbold’s complaint is about the authenticity of the information that he was provided with, in response to the request for information he made to Hastings Borough Council (the “Council”) under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”). The request was in connection with the Council’s Local Plan for the development of the town of Hastings. The Request for Information 3. On 25 June 2015, the Appellant wrote to the Council and requested information on the following terms: “I would be very grateful you provide me under freedom information request [sic] the REPORT ON THE EXAMINATION INTO THE HASTINGS LOCAL PLAN DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN REVISED PROPOSED SUBMISSION VERSION 10 MARCH – 22 APRIL 2014 before it was edited by the HBC Officers please? I understand this Microsoft Word document was sent to you 29 May 2015. 4. The Council responded on 17 July 2015, disclosing what it regarded as being the requested information. 5. The Appellant requested an internal review, following which the Council confirmed to the Appellant that it was satisfied that it had disclosed the information that the Appellant had requested. The Complaint to the Commissioner 6. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner. 7. The Commissioner noted that the information the Appellant had requested comprised a report created by the Planning Inspectorate and provided to the Council via e-mail on 29 May 2015 (the “Report”). -2-8. The Council explained to the Commissioner that in addition to the original form in which the Report was provided to it by the Planning Inspectorate, there was an earlier “fact check” version of the Report which had been issued by the Planning Inspectorate on 14 May 2015. The purpose of the “fact check” version was to identify any factual errors. The Council had responded to the “fact check” version and had set out a number of suggested modifications to the Report. The final Report was then sent to the Council on 29 May 2015. 9. The Council also explained that subsequent to the publication of the final Report on 22 June 2015, the inspector who was the author of the Report, had contacted the Council with a request to make a factual correction. That correction was made by the Council’s Planning Policy Manager, and the correction was explained on the Council’s website. 10. The Council confirmed to the Commissioner that the Appellant had been provided with all versions of the Report referred to above. 11. The Commissioner noted the Appellant’s concern that the Report had not been signed by the person who was named as its author, and therefore, that it did not constitute an authentic Report. The Appellant was concerned that if an “authentic” Report was not held, it had an impact on any actions taken in relation to the substantive matters referred to in the Report. 12. The Commissioner noted that the Council had explained that it had attempted to reassure the Appellant that the versions of the Report provided to him were the only ones it held. It had also explained the chronology and rationale for the different versions of the Report. It had further explained that all inspectors’ reports contained the relevant inspectors’ electronic signature, as opposed to an actual handwritten signature. 13. The Commissioner was satisfied that the Council had disclosed the information requested. He noted that the Appellant had provided no direct evidence that what had been disclosed did not mirror what was held by the Council. The dispute appeared simply to be about what form the requested Report should take. The Commissioner explained, in his decision notice, that the Commissioner’s role was to determine whether the Council had disclosed the information requested, and he was satisfied that it had done so. The Appeal to the Tribunal 14. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal against the decision notice. The Council has not been joined as a party. 15. The Appellant makes a number of points in his grounds of appeal. Certain of his points (for example, about the Commissioner’s investigation and the delay in issuing the decision notice), do not constitute substantive grounds of appeal or do not come within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. -3-16. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal also say that the conclusions in the Commissioner’s decision notice contradict a different decision notice dated 5 October 2015 (reference FER0590308). I will refer to that decision notice as DN1. 17. There is a further relevant decision notice. This is dated 26 October 2015 (reference FER0601857) which I will refer to as DN2. I will refer to the decision notice which is the subject of this appeal as DN3. 18. The Appellant says that DN1 clearly states that the Planning Inspectorate does not hold an authenticated copy of the Report yet DN3 confirms that the Council does. The Appellant also takes issue with the fact that DN3 does not refer to DN1, nor the information gathered during the investigation leading to DN1. 19. All parties requested that the appeal be determined on the papers without an oral hearing. Having regard to the nature of the issues raised, and the nature of the evidence, I am satisfied that the appeal can properly be determined without an oral hearing. 20. I have considered all the documents and written submissions received from the parties (even if not specifically referred to in this decision), including, in particular, the documents contained in the agreed bundle of documents. 21. This decision has been made by one judge, pursuant to paragraph 11(2) of Practice Statement 11. The parties were notified that this would be the case by a letter from the Tribunal dated 15 April 2016. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 22. Regulation 18 of the EIR provides that the enforcement and appeals provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) shall apply for the purposes of the EIR (save for the modifications set out in the EIR). 23. Under section 58(1) of FOIA, if the Tribunal considers that a Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, if the Tribunal considers that he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 24. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. -4-Statutory Framework 25. The EIR implements Council Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. There is no dispute that the information requested in the present case constitutes “environmental information” as defined in regulation 2(1), and therefore comes within the scope of the EIR. 26. A public authority which holds environmental information must make it available on request (regulation 5(1)). It must make the information available as soon as possible, and no later than 20 days after receiving the request. 27. Under regulation 12(1), a public authority may refuse to disclose information in certain circumstances. In the present case, the public authority has not refused. The Council says it has complied with the request. The only issue before me, therefore, is whether it has done so. Findings 28. In order to understand the Appellant’s grounds of appeal, I have given careful consideration to his grounds of appeal as well as to the Appellant’s further document headed “Response of Appellant” dated 22 February 2016, in which he responds to the Commissioner’s Response dated 1 February 2016. 29. The Appellant’s position is not wholly clear, but it appears that the key point he is making is that the Commissioner’s conclusions in DN3 contradicts DN1, and must, therefore, be wrong. More specifically, the Appellant argues that DN1 clearly states that the Planning Inspectorate does not hold an authenticated copy of the Report, and yet DN3 confirms that the Council does hold an authenticated copy of the Report and has provided the Appellant with a copy of it. 30. It may be appropriate at this juncture to explain the background to DN1 and DN2. Both relate to requests made by the Appellant to the Planning Inspectorate. On 25 June 2015, the Appellant wrote to the Planning Inspectorate and requested a copy of the Hastings Local Development Plan. His description of what he was seeking was on almost exactly the same terms as the request he made to the Council, as set out at paragraph (3) above. 31. The Planning Inspectorate provided the Appellant with what it understood to be the requested information. The Appellant was dissatisfied. Amongst other things, he raised concerns that the document provided to him was not digitally signed by or otherwise authored by the Planning Inspector tasked with producing the document. 32. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, it became clear that the Appellant was not seeking the “fact check” version of the Report, but rather, he was seeking a copy of the final report as had -5-been forwarded by the Planning Inspectorate to the Council. The Planning Inspectorate provided the Appellant with this final version of the Report. However, the Appellant maintained that due to the electronic signature/meta data properties of the document, it was not the final version of the Report which he had requested. 33. In DN1, the Commissioner decided that the Planning Inspectorate had in fact satisfied the request, and had provided the Appellant with the versions of the Report he had requested. 34. On 1 October 2015, the Appellant submitted a further request to the Planning Inspectorate requesting the same information as he had previously, except he qualified this to be a request for the “authenticated” version of the final Report showing the Inspector as the author. In response, the Planning Inspectorate confirmed that it had already provided him with a copy of the document and that they did not hold any “authenticated” versions of the Report. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner and this led to DN2, in which the Commissioner set out his findings that the Planning Inspectorate did not hold an “authenticated” version of the Report. 35. In his reasons as set out in DN1 and DN2, the Commissioner noted that the Planning Inspectorate had confirmed that it did not hold any further copies or versions of the Report. Nevertheless, the Appellant maintained the document he had been provided with, did not constitute the final Report authored by the relevant Planning Inspector. The Commissioner invited the Appellant to accept the possibility that what he expected to receive may not necessarily reflect the reality of what was held by the Planning Inspectorate. The Commissioner also explained that it was not the Commissioner’s role to investigate the procedural arrangements which public authorities had in place for creating or editing documents. The Commissioner further suggested that the author of a document may not necessarily be the final person to edit or otherwise electronically manipulate the information. 36. There was no appeal against DN1 or DN2. 37. I turn now to consider what the Appellant asserts about the contradiction between DN1 and DN3. If there is a contradiction, I accept that may be a relevant matter in deciding the present appeal to the extent that it may cast light on whether the Council provided the Appellant with what it held. 38. However, it is not at all clear what contradiction the Appellant asserts exists. On my reading of both decision notices, I can see none that indicates that what the Appellant was provided in response to his request to the Planning Inspectorate is any different, in content, from what he has been provided with from the Council. I agree with the Commissioner that he did not conclude, in any of the decision notices, that an “authenticated” Report, as defined by the Appellant, had been provided to him. In fact, I note that neither his request to the Planning Inspectorate on 25 June 2015, nor his request to the Council on the same date, was made in terms of seeking an authenticated Report. It -6-is what he sought in his request to the Planning Inspectorate on 26 October 2015. In that case, in DN2, the Commissioner found that the Planning Inspectorate did not hold a version of the Report which was authenticated in the sense expected by the Appellant. 39. It may be that the difficulty has arisen from the Appellant’s interpretation of authenticity and his expectation that an authenticated Report should be held. 40. It also seems that the Appellant’s concern is more in relation to what he thinks the Council should hold and why it is important that there be an authenticated version of the Report. He says, for example, at paragraph 14 of his Response that: “Any document can be authenticated genuine or legalised for around £30.00. The Government gives services to this end. The Commissioner’s solicitors’ inference that this request has been served and document is held is obscure. Would he suggest that any document can be served as a response to a Foyer and it is not important that it can be proved to be not from the origin it should have come from? Is he suggesting he or anyone could write this requested document, give it to ‘the Council’ and this would be quite correct to be served as a response from ‘the Council’ in this Foyer? Would this not make the whole process for obtaining ‘Foyer’ documents unworkable.” 41. If the Appellant’s point is that there should be a system for ensuring that what is provided by a public authority in response to a request for information is authenticated in some way, that is not a matter within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. He is entitled only to be provided with what the Council holds. 42. Having considered all the evidence and arguments, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Council has satisfied the Appellant’s request by providing him with all versions of the Report that it holds. The Appellant has provided no evidence that could undermine this finding. Whatever he considers that the Council should hold or the form in which the Report should be provided are matters that have no bearing on the outcome of this appeal. Decision 43. For all the reasons set out above, this appeal is dismissed. Signed Date: 18 July 2016 Anisa Dhanji Judge -7-"
"39","Substantive Refusal","Neutral Citation Number IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case Nos. EA/2016/0018 & 0022 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice Nos: FS 50598756 & FS50610750 Dated: 13 & 28 January 2016 Appellant: Ms Anna Christie Respondent: Information Commissioner Public Authority: Southwark Council Heard at: Fox Court London Date of hearing: 14 June 2016 Date of decision: 18 June 2016 Before Angus Hamilton Judge and Dave Sivers and Andrew WhetnallAppeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 Subject matter: s 1(1) Freedom of Information Act 2000 Cases considered: Bromley v IC and Environment Agency IT 31 August 2007 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notices dated 13 and 28 January 2016 and dismisses the appeals. -2-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction Under section 1(1) of FOIA (the Act) a person who has made a request to a 1 public authority for information is, subject to other provisions of FOIA: (1) entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request (section 1(1)(a)); and (2) if the public authority does hold the information, to have that information communicated to him (section 1(1)(b)). Requests by the Appellant & The Commissioner’s Decisions 2 On 30 September 2015 the Appellant wrote to the public authority making the following request: “1. Would you please state the employment title of Ms CD and confirm or not whether she is legally certificated to work as a process server, and if so please state which Court she works for, and confirm or otherwise whether or not she is a member of a bailiff association or trade organisation. 2. Please provide a copy of her signed Code of Conduct from her employer. 3. Please provide copies of her legal authority to serve statutory demands. -3-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 4. Please provide the name and address of your bailiff company.” 3 The Council provided its response dated 6 October 2015 (albeit attached to a covering email dated 27 October 2015), confirming that it did not hold the information sought in questions 1-3. The Council provided the information requested for question 4. 4 The Appellant requested an internal review of the Council’s decision. The Council provided its response to the internal review on 11 November 2015. The Council confirmed its original decision: that the information requested at questions 1-3 was not held by the Council. 5 The Appellant complained to the Commissioner about the Council’s response. The Commissioner conducted an investigation and issued Decision Notice FS50598756 on 13 January 2016 in accordance with s. 50 of the Act. The Commissioner held that the public authority had complied with its obligations under s1(1) of FOIA. The Commissioner found that, on the balance of probabilities the public authority did not hold the sought information. 6 On 30 September 2015 the Appellant also wrote to the public authority making the following request: “1. Please state the job title and job description of Mr AB. 2. Please state whether Mr AB is certificated to act as a bailiff or is a member of his trade organisation. 3. Please state whether Mr AB has had complaints relating to his behaviour from members of the public. 4. Please state whether the Authority has checked whether he has signed a Code of Conduct and it has been seen by London -4-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 Borough Southwark HR Officers/ Managers. 5. Please state whether any criminal checks were made on Mr AB’s background prior to his employment with Southwark Council. 6. Please state the Court which Mr AB works for.” 7 On 6 October 2015 the public authority provided its response, stating that following a search of its records, the information requested was not held by the public authority. 8 The Appellant requested an internal review on 27 October 2015 asserting that the public authority’s legal services department did hold the requested information. 9 The public authority responded on 11 November 2015, upholding its original decision that it did not hold the information requested. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner about the public authority’s response. 10 The Commissioner served Decision Notice FS50610750 on 28 January 2016 in relation to this matter in accordance with s. 50 of the Act. Again the Commissioner held that the public authority had complied with its obligations under s1(1) of FOIA. Again the Commissioner found that, on the balance of probabilities the public authority did not hold the sought information. 11 In both cases the Commissioner established through his investigation that neither of the named individuals were employed or had ever been employed by the public authority and so it did not hold any information about them as employees. The public authority also advised that, in respect of Mr AB, it had not received a complaint about him. The public authority also explained that both Mr AB and Ms CD had acted on behalf of the public authority as process servers. The public authority explained that when it needed to use a process server to serve court documents, it might appoint a local firm, -5-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 depending on the availability and location for service. When using such firms, the public authority did not require information about those firms’ employees or ask for copies of codes of conduct. The public authority therefore did not have details of employment titles or membership of trade organisations. The Appeals to the Tribunal 12 On 30 January 2016 the appellant submitted appeals to the Tribunal (IRT) in relation to the two Decision Notices. As the appeals raise very similar matters they have been considered together. 13 In her Grounds of Appeal Ms Christie makes a number of assertions which can be briefly summarised as follows: a) That the individuals in question are ‘very well known’ to the public authority. b) That the individuals in question are in fact employees of the public authority. c) That the public authority is lying and does in fact hold the sought information. d) That if the public authority does not hold the sought information that it ought to or could easily obtain it. 14 Ms Christie also submitted a statement which Ms CD, in her role as a process server, had prepared for the the public authority in relation to proceedings it had brought against Ms Christie. Ms Christie also submitted an email addressed to the public authority dated 11 October 2014 in which she comments that: ‘A letter was pushed in my face…. After I was hit in my shoulder by Mr AB after I tried to close the door on AB’. Ms Christie appeared to be submitting this email as evidence that the public authority had received a complaint about Mr AB, that they were being -6-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 dishonest on this issue, and, therefore, were likely to be being dishonest about not holding the other sought information. The Questions for the Tribunal 15 This matter was considered on the papers only. The public authority was not joined as a party to the proceedings and made no formal representations to the Tribunal. 16 The Tribunal judged that the sole question for them was to consider whether the Commissioner was correct to conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, the public authority did not hold the sought information. That the test is on the balance of probabilities was proposed in Bromley v IC and Environment Agency IT 31 August 2007. The decision was not binding upon the Tribunal but the Tribunal chose to follow it. 17 The Tribunal considered all the written material before it presented by both the Commissioner and the appellant. 18 The Tribunal considered that both of the appeals were devoid of any real merit and also considered that the appellant was fortunate not to have the appeals struck out administratively upon receipt. 19 The Tribunal dealt with the points raised by the appellant in the following ways: <U+F0B7> The Tribunal considered that it was irrelevant whether the individuals were well known to the public authority or not. <U+F0B7> The Tribunal noted that the appellant had provided no evidence whatsoever in relation to her claim that the individuals were in fact employees of the public authority and no evidence to undermine the explanation from the public authority that the individuals were employed by an external company. -7-Appeal No.: EA/2016/0018/0022 <U+F0B7> The Tribunal did not consider that the appellant’s email of 11 October 2014 constituted a complaint against Mr AB. The word ‘complaint’ does not appear in the email in relation to Mr AB and the email lacked any other element which would have established it as a complaint. The allegation about being struck appeared to be entirely tangential to the rest of the contents of the email. Thus it did not constitute evidence that the public authority was ‘lying’ about not having received any complaints about Mr AB. The Tribunal noted that the appellant had not produced any other evidence from which it could be inferred that the public authority was being dishonest or acting in bad faith. <U+F0B7> The Tribunal could not see the relevance of the statement from Ms CD since it provided no evidence at all that the public authority held the sought information. The Tribunal were bewildered as to why the appellant felt that it did. <U+F0B7> FOIA does not impose any obligation on a public authority to gather information which it ‘ought’ to have or which it could ‘easily obtain’. It relates only to information actually held. Conclusion 20 The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Commissioner was correct to conclude that on the balance of probabilities the public authority did not hold the sought information. 21 Our decision to dismiss these appeals is unanimous.

Date of Decision 9TH June 2016 BEFORE Ms Fiona Henderson (Judge) Mr Paul Taylor And Mr Dave Sivers Subject r 13 EIRs – Personal data Case Law: South Lanarkshire Council v Scottish Information Commissioner 2013 UKSC 55 Goldsmith International Business School v IC and Home Office [2014] UKUT 563 (AAC) Decision: The Appeal is refused (save in relation to documents available elsewhere) 1Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 REASONS FOR DECISION 1. This is an appeal against Decision notice FER0574247 dated 16th July 2015 in which the Commissioner concluded that Bristol City Council (the Council) were correct to rely upon regulation 13 of the EIRs to withhold the disputed information.1 Background 2. Mr Murphy is the representative of the owners of No.4 (the Appellants), their neighbours at No. 3 had undergone building works on their property including the building of an extension. The building works were subject to planning permission and control under the Building Regulations 2010. The owners of No. 3 did not serve a party wall notice under the Party Wall Etc Act 1996 despite a letter sent on the Appellant’s behalf from a Party Wall Surveyor2 asking them to issue a Party Wall notice, pointing out what the Appellants believed were flaws in the existing plans which impacted their property and indicating that in the absence of a Party Wall notice this letter would serve as a “letter before action” should the Appellants need to seek an Injunction. 3. The owners of No. 3 submitted a revised foundation design (for the wall nearest to No.4) prior to an injunction being obtained. The Appellants were of the view that the new design appeared to significantly reduce a particular risk associated with one wall of the proposed extension but other issues remained. An agreed Schedule of Condition was also completed. On the advice of the Appellants’ Party Wall surveyor the Appellants did not proceed with the injunction. The Information Request 4. On 7th November 2014 the Appellants requested: “full information on the building regulations application and site inspections. This information should include the name and qualifications of the “approved inspector”.” 5. The request was refused on 22nd December 2014 under s40(2) FOIA.3 Following reconsideration at an internal review the Council released the name and qualifications of 1 The Commissioner also held that the Council breached regulation 5(2) as it did not comply fully with the request within the prescribed 20 working day time frame. This is not the subject of this appeal. 2 P58 OB dated 21.07.14 3 Personal Data 2Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 the inspector4 and concluded that the correct access regime was EIRs, nevertheless it withheld the rest of the information under reg 13(1) EIRs.5 6. The Appellants complained to the Commissioner on 4th March 2015 arguing that the withheld information was technical data and not personal data. During the currency of the Commissioner’s investigation the Council disclosed information from the building control file which it considered to be the Appellants’ personal data under s7 DPA6. The information included plans relating to the foundations of the party wall and extracts of the calculations. The Appeal 7. The Appellants appealed to the Tribunal on 10th August 2015 on the grounds that: i) The majority of the data should be categorized as the Appellants’ personal data, ii) The Council had been inconsistent in their definition of what was the Appellants’ personal data as they only provided structural information relating to the foundations close to the Appellants’ property. Other structural information relating to within 3m of their property e.g. beams had been withheld. iii) The information requested is technical and biographical details could be redacted. Layout of the rooms was already in the public domain iv) Disclosure would not be unfair or unwarranted, as if there were errors in the construction of No.3 it was in the owners’ interests to have those errors uncovered so that they could sue their advisors and possibly the Council. v) The Appellants believed that the Council were misusing data protection legislation to cover up inadequacies in their procedures. vi) The Appellants had a right to information which could potentially affect their home. 8. This case was listed for a determination on the papers on 9th February 2016. Upon consideration of the bundle prepared by the Commissioner the Tribunal was unable to 4 The information provided then was subsequently clarified 5 Personal data 6 The right of ""Subject Access"" 3Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 determine the case as it did not have sufficient information. The Tribunal having seen the withheld material raised the issue of whether it had been provided with all the information in scope of the request. The Council were therefore joined and further evidence was received from the Council and submissions from all parties. 9. Following the adjournment directions the Council clarified that some information was held on the electronic file and was not contained within the paper file from which the disputed information had been gathered. Additionally upon rechecking the paper file it became apparent that some of the documents were double sided and only one side had been copied and made its way into the disputed information. This information has been provided as annexes to the closed adjournment submissions and remains closed pursuant to rule 14(6). 10. The Tribunal is satisfied that it now has a complete copy of the disputed information. The Tribunal has set out its general reasons in this open decision and provided a closed table of the disputed material identifying the reasons that apply to each document. This should not be disclosed without leave of the Tribunal. Scope 11. The Closed bundle included some documents which had originated from the Appellants and appear in the open bundle7. The Tribunal is satisfied that there is no issue to determine in relation to these documents and does not include them in its determination. 12. There is no dispute between the parties that the EIRs are the correct access regime. 13. Whilst the Appellants do not accept that the information requested constitutes personal data, if it is, they argue that in light of the impact upon their property, it is their personal data and they argue that the Council have been inconsistent in their provision of personal data under s7 DPA as a subject access request. 14. The Tribunal observes that if the remaining disputed information is the Appellants’ personal data it is excluded from disclosure under reg 5(3)8 EIRs and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to order its disclosure. The Tribunal is satisfied that regardless of whether it is the Appellants’ personal data, as set out below, it is the personal data of the owners of 7 P58-60 and 89-90 OB reflect p 18-20 and 22-23 CB 8 To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject, paragraph (1) shall not apply to those personal data. 4Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 No.3 and the Tribunal has gone on to consider whether this information has been properly withheld pursuant to regulation 13(1) EIRs on that basis. Information available publicly 15. It is apparent that the Council have applied the exemption to the entirety of the information that has remained without considering whether individual documents have been properly withheld under regulation 13. This is based on their understanding of the Commissioner’s advice upon which they have relied. The Tribunal is satisfied that this is not the correct approach. The documents should each be considered individually as whether disclosure would breach the data protection principles would vary depending upon the nature of each document. Some of the documents that are currently withheld are publicly available for a fee from the Council or from other organisations9. There is a specific exemption for information accessible to an applicant by other means under FOIA (s21) but no directly equivalent regulation under EIRs, however, it is likely that regulation 12(4)(b) could be applicable if the Council’s view was that disclosure under EIR would be manifestly unreasonable10. However, the Council have a duty to provide advice and assistance pursuant to regulation 9 EIRs and if not prepared to provide a copy under EIRs in our judgment they were obliged to notify the Appellant of where it could be obtained. We are not satisfied that it can be right in these circumstances to withhold that information under regulation 13. Personal Data 16. The Appellants argue that the information is not personal data. They argue that the information requested is technical and biographical details could be redacted. 17. Personal data is defined under s1 DPA as: “data which relate to a living individual who can be identified – (a) From those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller… 18. The Tribunal agrees with the Commissioner that individuals can be identified from a postal address in conjunction with other sources such as Land Registry records or the 9 P1 (and reverse) p3 (and reverse) p8 and p16 (as presented in Appendix 4) 10 In light of the requirement to pay a fee for this information 5Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 electoral roll as well as local knowledge. The Appellants know the identity of the owners of No. 3 and as such we are satisfied that this is not a case where redaction would anonymise the data such that it no longer constituted personal data. 19. The Commissioner argues that the withheld information is about the fabric of the property at No. 3, a person’s home is a central part of his or her identity, it is typically the focus of family and private life. Information however technical about the layout design and construction of that home, is data that relates to those who live there. The biographical significance is that it tells about an important event in their lives namely the renovation and extension of their home. 20. The Tribunal agrees and is satisfied that the withheld information is the data subject’s personal data. Although much information is already in the public domain through the planning process such as the layout of the rooms and some construction information, this is the detail of how the data subject’s home is constructed and the process by which this was done. Although it is likely that much of the contact between the Council and the data subject is likely to be through the owners’ advisors the Tribunal observes that additional biographical details may11 also be included such as: <U+F0B7> A data subject’s attitude towards and the extent to which he co-operated with the building control process, <U+F0B7> whether the build approved was that which he originally wanted or whether he was required to make alterations or to compromise. <U+F0B7> whether there was any enforcement element to the building control or criticism of proposals of work done. (This would be apparent from any revisions to original proposals and in what circumstances, how many inspections there were, what took place at the inspections, whether work had to be redone or additional works undertaken). 19. Reg 13 EIRs provides: (1) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject and as respects which either the first or second condition below is satisfied, a public authority shall not disclose the personal data. 11 These are general observations upon the nature of the information requested and does not provide any indication of the actual contents of the disputed information in this case. 6Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 (2) The first condition is— (a)in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under these Regulations would contravene— (i)any of the data protection principles; … 21. The first data protection principle, as set out in Schedule 1, Part 1 paragraph 1 to the DPA, 1998 provides, that personal data shall be processed: “…fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless (a) at least one of the conditions in schedule 2 is met. ” 22. The Tribunal accepts the Commissioner’s argument that the information was obtained fairly and lawfully pursuant to Schedule I Part II: 1(2) subject to paragraph 212 for the purposes of the first principle data are to be treated as obtained fairly if they consist of information obtained from a person who— … (b)is required to supply it by or under any enactment… as the Council is under a legal obligation to implement the Building Regulations 2010 and it is necessary for that purpose to record the withheld information. 21. The Schedule 2 conditions include – (6) (1) – The processing is necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by the … third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject”. 23. The test to be applied in relation to Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 to the DPA is that of Goldsmith International Business School v IC and Home Office [2014] UKUT 563 (AAC) 12 Paragraph 2 is not applicable on the facts of this case by reference to paragraph 3(2)(b) (b)that the recording of the information to be contained in the data by, or the disclosure of the data by, the data controller is necessary for compliance with any legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, other than an obligation imposed by contract. 7Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 where the Upper Tribunal endorsed the principles to follow which include insofar as it is material on the facts of this case: “Proposition 1: Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 requires 3 questions to be asked namely: i) Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? ii) Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? iii) Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? Proposition 2: The test of “necessity” under stage (ii) must be met before the balancing test under stage (iii) is applied. Legitimate Interests 24. The first question is whether the person to whom the data is disclosed is pursuing a legitimate interest. We accept that we are entitled to take into account private interests (e.g. those of the Appellant and his family) as well of those of the wider public. In addition to the wording of condition 6 itself which includes the “legitimate interests pursued by the … third party”; South Lanarkshire Council v Scottish Information Commissioner 2013 UKSC 55 (in the context of discussing necessity) states “…a legitimate interest, which may be a purely private interest, in condition 6 …”. 25. The Appellants argued that disclosure was reasonably necessary for the furtherance of a legitimate interest. Those interests were identified as: i) their own reassurance in light of their belief that the design and construction of No.3 may be deficient and that the flaws could have been hidden13. ii) Safety to those using or passing No. 3 and No.4. including the general public iii) Scrutiny – so that the public will know that the Building regulations are being implemented effectively. 13 We have no confirmation that the foundation was actually built as shown [and have concerns from the outward appearance that there is adequate cover to the foundations to prevent ground movement]p89 OB 8Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 The Tribunal is satisfied that these are all legitimate interests however, as set out below, the Tribunal is not satisfied that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of those interests. Necessity 26. The Appellants argue that the building regulations information should be treated like planning information and routinely disclosed. The Appellants have argued that Building Regulations are part of a legal process used to ensure that the health, welfare and convenience of persons living in or working in (or nearby) buildings is secured. Failure to comply with structural and other requirements of Building Regulations may put at risk the Health and Safety of Persons in an adjoining building or even persons passing in the street. Therefore Building Regulation information must be made available to any person who is likely to be affected by it. 27. This Tribunal is concerned with the disclosure of the disputed information in this case and has no jurisdiction to provide a blanket policy for future application. Disclosure in this case would not provide sufficient information for comment to be made about the operation of the buildings regulations in general by the Council and as such disclosure in this case will not further the legitimate interests of general scrutiny. 28. The Tribunal accepts the Council’s evidence that where an independent buildings regulations inspector is used, they submit a form to confirm that they are taking on the work and have the relevant insurance. From the acceptance of the form the Council are not involved in the site and do not inspect. There is no further involvement until the independent inspector confirms completion. Consequently, it cannot be that there is an intention for anyone who has an interest in a building to expect to have a right to the information under EIRs since it will not always be held by the public authority. 29. The Appellants in this case have had it confirmed to them that14: “I can confirm that the application in this case is approved and that site inspections have been undertaken at the agreed stages to date. It will be inspected through to completion.” 30. The fact that the public are entitled to know that a building is subject to Building Regulations and that a certificate of completion has been issued (by application to the 14 P 86 OB 9Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 Council for a fee as advertised on their website) in our judgment is intended to provide the reassurance and scrutiny that constructions are being inspected and monitored for compliance. 31. If the Appellants have concerns that the Council is not fulfilling its duties properly (and in this case the Appellants have alleged that the Council’s motivation for withholding this information is to disguise their own failures) there is a remedy available namely the Local Government Ombudsman.15 32. South Lanarkshire Council v Scottish Information Commissioner 2013 UKSC 55 states at paragraph 27: “A measure which interferes with a right protected by community law must be the least restrictive for the achievement of a legitimate aim. Indeed, in ordinary language we would understand that a measure would not be necessary if the legitimate aim could be achieved by something less.” 33. In this case the Tribunal is satisfied that the legitimate aims identified were achievable by other avenues and thus not necessary.16 34. Information has been provided to the Appellants under Subject Access Request provisions of the DPA. This has reduced the necessity of the provision of the rest of the disputed information. Although the Appellant notes that none of the original building control information has been disclosed – only the “revised” foundation information, in relation to which he observes the structural calculations were legible but the design drawing was not. The previous plans and calculations where they have been superseded no longer have a bearing on the actual construction and can only go to the issue of whether the original plans were sufficiently rigorously scrutinized. The Appellants’ arguments are based on the assumption that the revision of the plans was a concession that the earlier plans could have had a detrimental effect on the property rather than an attempt to assuage the fears of their neighbours or in response to the input of the Council. 35. Prior to the commencement of the works, the Appellants wrote to No.3 proposing that their respective surveyors to come to an agreement under the Party Wall Act which 15 As detailed in Paragraph 30 DN 16 We have had First Tier Tribunal case EA/2013/0055 drawn to our attention. We are not bound by this decision and we are not satisfied that sufficient consideration was given in that case to whether the legitimate aim could be achieved by something less than disclosure of the personal data to the world at large. 10Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 would settle their concerns around key structural issues. It is the Appellants case that No. 3 refused to co-operate, had they co-operated there would have been no need for the Freedom of Information request. 36. That the appropriate arena to raise the issues that the Appellants had (and still have) in relation to reassurance about the construction of the works is via the Party Wall process is reflected in the Council’s email of 23.10.14:17 “Normally where applicable consultation under the Party Wall Act would enable you to raise any such concerns about the proposal and the effects on your property, prior to commencement. However, this is civil legislations between the parties and not part of building regulation or planning.” 37. The Tribunal observes that whilst it is correct that No.3 did not issue a party wall notice they revised their plans and a schedule of condition was agreed. In their letter to No.3 of 21.7.14 the Appellants stated that: “The remedy for a breach of statutory duty or unlawful work in this circumstance is in common law via either Injunctive relief and/or damages”18 38. An injunction can be obtained in order to remedy the breach of statutory duty namely the failure to serve the Party Wall Notice. The Appellants chose not to do this but agreed to a course of conduct which provided them with fewer protections than a full party wall award would have ensured. The Tribunal is not satisfied that it is proportionate to disclose the contents of the building regulations file to remedy the Appellants choice not to enforce their rights under the Party Wall Act. 39. In the grounds of Appeal the Appellants also suggested that if errors in the inspection and application of the building regulations came to light this would be in the interests of the owners of No.3, the data subjects. They are entitled to the information relating to them by way of a subject access request under the DPA, as such we are not satisfied that disclosure to the world at large under EIR would be necessary on this basis. Unwarranted 40. The Tribunal has also considered whether, if we are wrong in relation to necessity disclosure would be unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. We are satisfied that it would be. 17 P86 OB 18 P59 OB 11Murphy v Information Commissioner and Bristol City Council EA/2015/0174 41. The Tribunal accepts that the information that is being withheld has no particular sensitivity; however, the Tribunal does observe that unlike planning applications building control files are not routinely disclosed or published to the world at large. Whilst this is not in itself a prohibition of its disclosure it informs the data subjects reasonable expectation when the information is obtained. 42. The Appellants argue that most people would not consider it different from planning information which is publicly available however, the Tribunal notes that the contents of the building regulation file are different from Planning information in that they are likely to include site visits/inspections, and unlike planning there is no consultation process or positive assertion that there will be publication. Although it is accepted that often similar types of information to that submitted in relation to buildings regulations is disclosed pursuant to a party wall agreement or as in this case in direct communication with a neighbour, in these cases it is bilateral and not to the world at large. 43. An alternative to using a Council Building Regulations inspector, as set out above is to use an independent inspector who has no obligation to provide inspection information to the Council. There is no evidence that this distinction has ever been brought to the attention of the data subjects who are thus at risk of the exposure of more of their personal data than someone who had not used a Council inspector. This inequality of position in our judgment is relevant in finding that disclosure would be unwarranted. Conclusion 44. The Appeal is refused for the reasons set out above and in the closed schedule (save that the Tribunal is not satisfied that the documents itemised in footnote 9 to paragraph 15 above were correctly withheld under r13 EIRs as they were publicly available elsewhere). The Tribunal requires the Council to either provide the publicly available information to the Appellants or to direct them to where it can be obtained within 35 days. In all other respects the appeal is refused. Dated this 9th day of June 2016 Promulgated 10th June 2016 Fiona Henderson Tribunal Judge 12"

The Appellant in these proceedings is concerned about the operation and future of his local airport, Durham Tees Valley Airport, where there are a relatively small number of services operating. The airport is owned by Peel Airports and six local authorities in the region own a minority stake in the airport; one of these is Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council (“the Council”). 2. On 18 December 2014 he wrote to the Council requesting information in the following terms:- ‘George Garlick, 20/11/07:To appoint McInnes Corporate Finance LLP, in conjunction with Dickinson Dees, Solicitors, to undertake a corporate financial review regarding the Local Authorities' shareholding in Durham Tees Valley Airport, particularly the question whether the Councils should maintain that shareholding or allow it to be diluted, including a review of the pros and cons of investing further in the Airport. To appoint Dickinson Dees to provide legal advice and support to McInnes Corporate Finance, and to provide a view on the South Side documentation in the context of the Subscription and Shareholders' Agreement. Can the McInnes review and Dickenson Dees advice be made public? George Garlick, 07: 1. the report of the Directors and audited accounts for year ended 31/3/07 be adopted; 2. no dividend be declared for 2006/07. Can these accounts be made public including written resolutions that were accepted by Stockton BC? 03 October 2013 Engaging Cavu Corporate Finance Limited to provide expert advice and 10 May 2013 To engage Dickinson Dees - DTVA. Can review and advice be made public?’ 3. The Council responded on 21 January 2015. It advised him that the second request, for the accounts and resolutions, was for information available from Companies House. It confirmed that it held the reports mentioned in the first and third requests and refused to disclose them relying on exemptions contained in FOIA sections 36(2)(b) and (c), 41, 42, 43(2) and, insofar as the information was environmental 2Appeal No:EA/2015/0158 information EIR regulations 12(5)(e) and (f). On review it upheld this position and the Appellant renewed his complaint to the Respondent in these proceedings, the Information Commissioner (“ICO”) who investigated and on 22 July 2015 issued a decision notice rejecting the complaint and finding that the Council was entitled to rely on the exemptions under FOIA 36(2)(c) and EIRs regulation 12(5)(e). 4. The Appellant challenged this. His grounds of appeal were that:- “The decision does not give sufficient weight to the demonstrated public interest.” 5. In support of that claim he submitted his correspondence with the ICO case officer who had investigated the case; this drew attention to a campaign to “Save Teesside Airport” and to apparent differences of opinion between councillors. He argued that the campaign to save the airport amounted to “an unequivocal case for release of information held in secret by the minority shareholders who are accountable public bodies”. In support of his appeal he filed a witness statement from a councillor supporting the disclosure of information, a letter from a local editor criticising development proposals for the airport, a statement expressing concern that Peel Holdings might not have met their commitments and claiming there was huge public opposition to the proposals for the airport and a statement from an individual detailing his unsuccessful attempts to use FOIA to obtain information from another of the local authorities involved in the airport. 6. The Respondent noted that the appeal did not contain any new arguments not previously considered by the ICO and resisted the appeal. The scope of the appeal to the Tribunal 7. In his decision notice the ICO found that the information was protected from disclosure by section 36(2)(c) FOIA. This provides that “in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person, disclosure of the information under this Act ...(c) would otherwise prejudice, or would be likely otherwise to prejudice, the effective conduct of public affairs”. The Appellant has not challenged this finding and therefore the issue for the Tribunal is where the balance of public interest lies between the prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs and the undoubted public interest in a fuller understanding of the position of the Council with respect to the airport and its future. 3Appeal No:EA/2015/0158 8. Regulation12(5) permits a public authority to refuse to disclose certain environmental information “to the extent that such disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest;”. Again this has not been challenged and the question for the Tribunal is essentially the same balancing of public interest test as is carried out under FOIA. Consideration 9. The material in dispute consists in part of legal advice from a firm of solicitors (Dickinson Dees, later Bond Dickinson) on legal issues facing the local authority shareholders. The remainder of the material is financial analysis of those issues by firms of consultants. At the time of the request for the information there were discussions between the local authority shareholders and the Peel Group on future options. The Appellant himself on 22 January 2015 in a communication to the ICO (bundle page 42-44) endorsed a statement by the campaign group that “Peel has the councils and the area over a barrel”. It is clear that difficult negotiations between the local authorities and Peel Group were in progress and it is likely that the stance of the local authorities was significantly shaped by the advice that it received from its legal adviser and its financial consultants. Public disclosure of the legal and financial advice underpinning their approach would give a significant advantage to the Peel Group and thus would be highly likely to prejudice the public interest. Indeed the introduction to one of the documents is endorsed with a warning to that effect. 10. The material is highly confidential and relates to significant negotiations. The public was, at the time, aware of the issues, disclosure of the material would not significantly improve public understanding and engagement with the policy choices facing the councils and would harm the council's ability to discharge their responsibilities. The Tribunal is satisfied that the ICO has correctly analysed the issues raised by this request and has come to the only conceivable answer. The ICO’s decision notice is correct in law and the appeal is dismissed. 11. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 16 February 2016 4"

For present purposes It is that disclosure to a member of the public otherwise than under the EIR would contravene any of the data protection principles (see DPA Schedule 1). The material principle is the first which requires that all data must be fairly and lawfully processed and, in particular, must meet at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 to the DPA.) Authorities referred to Edem v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA (Civ.) 92 Durant v Financial Services Authority [2003] EWCA (Civ.) 2046 .Our Decision The Background 1. MS lives in Gilbert ‘s Coombe near Redruth, Cornwall. Early in 2014, Cornwall granted to the landowner/ occupant a certificate of lawful use for motorcycle trials, practice and training (“the certificate”) on land about fifty metres from her property. 2. The inevitable noise and the traffic aroused strong opposition from MS and other local residents. They challenged Cornwall’s finding that such activities had taken place on the relevant land for more than ten years, which was the legal precondition to the grant of the certificate. Questions were asked as to whether council officers involved in the assessment of the claim for the certificate had themselves participated in these trials or practice so as to create an obvious appearance of bias in their decision. 3. In addition to this challenge, over a significant period, MS sought the disclosure of what she deemed important documents held by Cornwall, revealing the nature of its dealings with the application for the certificate. The request 4. On 18th. March, 2014, MS wrote to Cornwall in these terms – “I am requesting an enquiry into the recent granting to land at Gilbert’s Coombe for a Certificate of lawful use of motor cycle trials, practice and training (So far this was a request relating to a planning issue, not a FOIA request for information.) I also request under the Freedom of Information Act any minutes of meeting, phone calls or indeed any other references taken during the time(x) was making his decision. I also ask for the names of any persons who were involved in the decision to award the certificate (delegated decision). I also ask for the names of the three planning officers that are members of the Motor Club in question as this would certainly be a conflict of interest.”. 5. Cornwall responded on 22nd. May, 2014. It indicated that some material within scope was accessible on its website and provided other information as a PDF attachment. It stated further that it held additional responsive information as to which it relied on exceptions provided for in EIR reg. 12(4)(d) and (e), 12(5)(b)(d) and (f) and reg. 13. This decision deals more fully with some of these exceptions and their relevance to this appeal below. 6. Cornwall also disclosed that the withheld information included a draft officer report (the final version of which was published on its website), a request for legal advice addressed by the planning department to a legal officer and the requested advice and a letter of objection. 7. Following an internal review requested by MS, Cornwall confirmed its refusal to disclose further information and its reliance on the exceptions already cited. It contended that the public interest, where a material factor, lay in withholding this information. MS complained to the ICO on 9th. October, 2014. The ICO’s investigation and the DN 8. On 4th.November, 2014 the ICO submitted to Cornwall the usual questionnaire, adapted to the facts of the particular case. In its response Cornwall produced a schedule which included on its first page a list of the exceptions relied on, linked to Appendix 1 to the response, which set out categories 1(a) – 1(e) of withheld information, attached to the response in unredacted form and described as follows –Category Content EIR Exception(s) relied on 1(a) Information disclosed to MS in redacted Reg. 13(1) form 1(b) Request for legal advice and advice Reg.12(5)(b), 12(4)(e) provided 1(c) “Legal correspondence” and draft report Reg.12(4)(d), 12(5)(b) 1(d) Note of legal team meeting Reg. 12(5)(b), 12(4)(e) 1(e) Objector’s letter Reg. 12(5)(f) All the documents referred to in this table were supplied unredacted to the Tribunal as to the ICO. 9. The DN upheld Cornwall’s reliance on reg. 13(1) as to “most of the personal data” contained in 1(a). It further accepted that the Reg.12(5)(b) exception ( disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice) was engaged in respect of all the information in 1(b), (c) and (d) as was reg.12(5)(f) as regards 1(e) (disclosure would adversely affect the interests of the person providing the information). In each case it concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighed the interest in disclosure. 10. MS appealed. The case for the Appellant 11. The submissions contained in MS’ Grounds of Appeal and two subsequent Responses to the Respondents’ arguments are directed in the main to the issues of law, fact and procedure relating to the issue of the certificate. She advances few, if any arguments on the engagement of the claimed exceptions, an understandable omission on the part of a factuallywell – informed member of the public unfamiliar with the interpretation of the EIR. 12. She argued very clearly, however, that, if any of those exceptions were engaged, the public interest in transparency as regards Cornwall’s handling of such a sensitive local issue was paramount. The case for the ICO and Cornwall 13. The ICO’s case as to reg. 13 is not entirely clear. He appears to argue that all the references to named individuals in the correspondence covered by 1(a) involve their personal data but that the disclosure of the names of senior council staff might not amount to unfair processing for the purposes of the first data protection principle. That would explain the reference to Reg. 13 being engaged as regards “the majority of the personal data”. He argued that the objector letter was the personal data of the author and that disclosure would be unfair to her. Reg. 12(5)(f) was engaged but he did not consider questions of the public interest because of his conclusion as to Reg. 13. 14. He submitted that Reg. 12(5)(b) was engaged in respect of all the material in 1(b)(c) and (d), which involved information subject to legal professional privilege and that the public interest required that the exceptions be maintained. Alternatively, the names appearing in 1(c) involved the personal data of those concerned and should be redacted for that reason. 15. As regards the public interest in disclosure, there was no weighty consideration which displaced the importance to be attached to the maintenance of confidentiality between client and lawyer, here Cornwall, in the form of its planning officer, and its internal solicitor. 16. Cornwall indicated in its Response that it considered that Reg. 12(5)(f) (adverse effect on the interests of the person providing the information) was engaged as regards the objector letter (1(e)) as well as reg. 13.Further, it stated that it had now disclosed the names of senior members of staff whose positions were identified in the DN, save in one case where the officer had not been involved in this case. So the Tribunal is concerned with the personal data of more junior council officers and of a number of members of the public and external solicitors. Our Reasons 17. The first question is the scope of the request, which was for “any minutes of meeting, phone calls or indeed any other references taken during the time (x) was making his decision”. “Any other references” is a vague term, which Cornwall seems to have treated very liberally as covering anything relevant to the decision on the certificate which was created during the period when that decision was being arrived at. We shall proceed on the footing that everything in 1(a) is within scope. The remaining classes (b) to (e) are undoubtedly within the ambit of the request. 18. We are required to deal only with the exceptions enacted in reg. 12(4)(e), 12(5)(b), 12(5)(f) and reg.13; reg. 12(4)(e) and 12(5)(f) are of marginal relevance. 19. We deal first with the application of reg. 13(1) to the documents in 1(a), all of which have been provided to MS but with names and sometimes roles, blanked out. 20. Uncertainties as to the effect of Durant v FSA [2003] EWCA (Civ.) 1746 on the interpretation of “personal data” have been dispelled by Edem v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA Civ 92, where the Court of Appeal explained the limited relevance of the two “notions” canvassed by Auld L.J. in Durant in the context of a specious subject access request. 21. It is now apparent that, in any request involving information as to third parties, ‘A name is personal data unless it is so common that withoutfurther information, such as its use in a work context, a person would remain unidentifiable despite its disclosure.” ( per Moses L.J. at para. 20). 22. There is therefore no doubt that the names in the redacted documents are “personal data”. 23. That being so, there is no evidence whatever to demonstrate that any condition in DPA Schedule 2 is satisfied in respect of any possible disclosure of the personal data of council officers. Indeed, nobody argued that any condition was met. The only potentially relevant condition, as usual, was condition 6(1) which requires proof that disclosure of the names “is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by (MS)”. Cornwall denies that any officer involved in the case had ridden on the land in question and there is no plausible evidence to refute that assertion. 24. Therefore, Cornwall was justified in withholding the names of members of its staff in documents in the range 207 – 233 of the Open Bundle, when revising its disclosures after the issue of the DN. It was, of course, entitled to provide names and particulars of senior staff, as it then did, with their consent. 25. The same applies for the same reasons, with few exceptions, to the names of members of the public appearing in the range 203 – 234, even though those familiar with this matter will have no difficulty in identifying most of them. Disclosure is disclosure to all the world. 26. One exception is the cremation certificate at 204. The name of the Registrar is critical to the validity of the document. 27. Another is the name of the author of the letter to Cornwall from Self – Drive Hire dated 31st. December, 2012. His identity is, in our opinion, critical to a proper assessment of the contents which support the grant of thecertificate. Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 to the DPA is satisfied since MS was pursuing her legitimate interests as a landowner in seeking such information. Other names in the letter do not require disclosure. 28. The objector letter also raises different issues to which we turn below. 29. The engagement of the exception in Reg. 12(5)(b) requires proof that it is more probable than not that disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice. In this case that depends on whether legal professional privilege (“LPP”) attaches to the information concerned, although the fact that a document is privileged does not determine, of itself, whether the exception is engaged nor whether, if it is, the public interest favours withholding it. 30. There are two kinds of LPP (i) legal advice privilege, which attaches to material involving the seeking and giving of legal advice, including tactical advice, between lawyer and client and (ii) litigation privilege, which protects material, including lawyer – client communications, which is created in the course or in contemplation and for the predominant purpose of litigation. 31 It does not arise unless one party to the communication is a lawyer, regardless of the subject matter or the fact that legal advice is sought or given. By its nature, it does not attach to correspondence between solicitors on opposite sides of a dispute or a negotiation, though the latter activity may be conducted “without prejudice”, thereby potentially protecting it from disclosure in court. 32 The memorandum of 24th. May, 2013, (Appendix 1(b)) though apparently disclosed in redacted form (see 222), was sent by one of Cornwall’s solicitors to its planning officer in the context of a request for legal advice. It isprivileged. 33 The same goes for the minute of a meeting on 14th. August, 2013 between the same parties for the purpose of discussing legal issues involved in any grant of the certificate (Appendix 1(d)). 34 The draft report on the certificate question was clearly prepared for submission to a solicitor, as shown by the Email of 9th. May, 2013 to which it was attached. It, together with that Email and the responding Email from the solicitor, are equally plainly privileged. (Appendix 1(c) (part)) 35 As regards each of these documents disclosure in March, 2014, would have revealed Cornwall’s assessment of the strength of its position at a time when litigation or further complaints were a clear possibility. They are also covered by legal advice privilege. The general principle as to the weakening of trust in the confidentiality of privileged communications, for Cornwall and more generally, plainly applies. 36 We have no doubt that disclosure of any of this information would have adversely affected the course of justice. 37 These are weighty factors in the balance of public interests. As to interests favouring disclosure, there is always the virtue of promoting the principle of transparency in public affairs. and the presumption in reg. 12(2) must be born in mind.38 However, there is nothing apparently improper or dubious In Cornwall’s handling of this matter, such as to justify overriding LPP. The Tribunal always regards the preservation of client confidence in this privilege as a vital public interest which will prevail in the absence of powerful counter arguments specific to the case. There are none such here. 39 Different considerations apply to other “legal correspondence” in Appendix 1(c). Cornwall has now disclosed these documents with names etc. redacted but we rule on the matter since Regs. 12(4)(e) and 12(5)(b) were initially relied on. 40 Neither the letter of 5th. August, 2013 from Stephens Scown to Mr. Woodley of the Planning department nor their Emails are privileged and no exemption applies save reg. 13 as already noted. 41 The two Emails to and from MY Motors are not privileged and no other exception is engaged, save, as before, Reg. 13 as regards the name of the proprietor. With that exclusion, they are disclosable. 42 The remaining withheld Emails passing between council officers and to and from a councillor are not privileged. They are internal communications within Reg. 12(4)(e). However, no argument has been advanced as to a public interest in withholding them In the context of this exception. The Reg. 12(2) presumption suffices, of itself, to require disclosure, subject again to the redaction of names which have not been disclosed.43 That brings us to Appendix 1(e), the objector letter, which can be coupled with an Email of 5th. April, 2014 from MS to Mr. Woodley. In our view both require subject access requests pursuant to DPA s.7(1) and are exempt from disclosure under the EIR by virtue of Reg. 5(3). The objector letter would, no doubt, be disclosed with substantial redactions relating to the personal data of third parties. Summary 44 The following withheld information is therefore disclosable. (i) The name of the Registrar who signed the cremation certificate, (ii) The name of the author of the letter referred to at Paragraph 27. 45 We allow this appeal to that extent. 46 This decision is unanimous.

"43","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Case Number EA/2015/0214 Date Promulgated 19th January 2016 ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice FS50567582 Appellant: MR IAN WHITE First Respondent: INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Heard on 12 January 2016 by way of telephone conference Before John Angel (Judge) and Pieter de Waal and Suzanne Cosgrave Subject matter: Section 14(1) FOIA vexatious request Cases cited: IC v Devon County Council & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC); Dransfield v IC & Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454. DECISION The Tribunal dismisses the appeal. 1REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. On the 12 December 2014 Mr White wrote to the Darlington Borough Council (“DBC”) requesting certain information in relation to the single rooms subsidy referred to by Mr White as, “the bedroom tax” and the application of that tax to his residence (“the Request”). The detailed request is set out in the Commissioner’s Decision Notice dated 9 September 2015 (“DN”) at [4] and contains 16 sub-requests or questions. DBC refused to provide the information on the basis it was a “vexatious” request under section 14(1) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) by letter dated 13 January 2015 (“the Refusal Notice”). Mr White complained to the Commissioner who found that DBC had correctly refused the Request. 2. Mr White appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) on 16 September 2015. The FTT issued case management notes in order to prepare the parties for the hearing. In the course of this process Mr White indicated he wanted an oral hearing but because of his personal circumstances asked for the hearing to be held at his home residence. This application was considered by the Registrar and Chamber President and it was eventually directed that a hearing would take place by way of telephone conference at 10 am on Tuesday 12 January 2016 and the parties were informed accordingly and provided with the appropriate telephone numbers to access the conference. The Commissioner indicated he would not be attending and Mr White informed the FTT that although he wished the hearing to take place he would not be attending. Despite this the Tribunal commenced a telephone conference hearing with the intention of giving Mr White every opportunity to put his case orally to the Tribunal. The Tribunal waited for 20 minutes to give Mr White the opportunity to join the hearing. As he did not do so the Tribunal decided that it would determine the case on the papers before it. The Legal Framework 23. The law as relevant to this case is set out in the Commissioner’s response to the notice of appeal at [6] to [14]. For the sake of clarity we set it out again in this decision. 4. Section 14(1) FOIA provides that a public authority may refuse a request for information where that request is vexatious. 5. The Upper Tribunal has provided guidance on section 14(1) FOIA in the linked cases of Information Commission v Devon Country Council & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC); Craven v Information Commission & Department for Energy and Climate Change [2012] UKUT 442 (AAC) and Ainslie v Information Commissioner & Dorset County Council [2012] UKUT 441 (AAC). 6. The leading case on the application of section 14 FOIA is Dransfield. In Dransfield, the Upper Tribunal defined a vexatious request as one which is a “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA” (at [43]). 7. The judgment of the Upper Tribunal has been upheld by the Court of Appeal: Dransfield v The Information Commissioner, Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454. 8. The Upper Tribunal analysed the definition of “vexatious” by reference to four broad issues: (a) the present or future burden on the public authority; (b) the motive of the requester; (c) the value and serious purpose of the request; and (d) whether the request causes harassment of, or distress to, staff. 9. The Upper Tribunal emphasised the importance of viewing a request in its context. Thus, in relation to issue (a), the Upper Tribunal noted (at [29]): “… the present or future burden on the public authority may be inextricably linked with the previous course of dealings. Thus the context and history of the particular request, in terms of previous dealings between the individual requester and the public authority, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious.” 310. In relation to (b), the Upper Tribunal explained that a request which may seem reasonable and benign “may be found to be vexatious in the wider context of the course of dealings between the individual and the relevant public authority” (at [34]). 11. The Court of Appeal held the starting point for an assessment of vexatiousness is whether there is any “reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public” (at [68]). The Court of Appeal agreed that the previous course of dealings between the requester and the Authority could affect this assessment. Arden LJ, giving the judgment of the Court, said at [68]: “… If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation.” 12. The Upper Tribunal in Dransfield said, at [11] that section 14 FOIA: “…allows the public authority to say in terms that ‘Enough is enough – the nature of this request is vexatious so that section 1 does not apply.’” Is the Request vexatious? 13. The Commissioner dismissed Mr White’s complaint on the basis that: a. it was highly likely that the purpose of the Request was to purposely disrupt DBC’s services – DN [23]; b. the Request combined with a history of previous requests amounted to a burden on DBC – DN [24]; c. the Request related to a personal matter which limited the value of the Request – DN [25]; 4d. the motive behind the Request and other requests was an abuse of the statutory rights under FOIA and starting to affect DBC’s ability to provide a public service - DN [26]. The Commissioner concluded that the Request was vexatious. 14. Mr White in his notice of appeal does not challenge any of these findings. He states that the information he seeks he “will need later in the Supreme Court, only the Local Authority…can give me this information…” 15. He continues: “I do not want to have to ask the court for this information when/if I get there I should be entitled to this as part of evidentury [sic] disclosure. My problem with Darlington Borough Council previously does not have any bearing on the need for this information which is of a legal nature not as such a “normal” FoIA request, I do not believe the ICO has taken this into account”. 16. The Commissioner in his response considered that an FOI request was not an appropriate avenue for Mr White to obtain information from an opposing party in litigation because the mechanism for disclosure in the context of those proceedings (an avenue which Mr White expressly said he wished to avoid) is the appropriate way, not FOIA. Also Mr White has provided no evidence whatsoever that he has actually commenced proceedings in the lower courts, much less that such proceedings are now approaching the Supreme Court. 17. On the evidence before us we must agree with the Commissioner. 18. The other ground put forward by Mr White is that his previous, and very extensive, dealings with the Council do not have any bearing on how this Request should be viewed for the purposes of section 14 FOIA. The 5Commissioner does not accept this for the reasons set out in the DN at [23]. 19. Under section 58 FOIA the FTT is required to consider whether the notice against which an appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law. We have a discretion as to whether to review the findings of fact upon which the DN was based (section 58(2)). We intend to exercise this discretion to review in this case because Mr White is a litigant in person and he may not appreciate how to set out his grounds of appeal, although we note that he has made a number of complaints to the Commissioner in relation to other requests. This means we have decided to review the papers before us to determine the facts for ourselves and not rely on the Commissioner’s findings. 20. The Upper Tribunal analysed the definition of “vexatious” by reference to four broad themes. We consider them below. The burden on DBC 21. DBC’s response dated 1 April 2015 to the Commissioner’s Office enquiry in relation to Mr White’s complaint stated that they had received 142 previous requests from Mr White containing some 914 separate questions since August 2006. Between 1 April 2014 and 15 December 2014 there had been 21 FOI requests with some 200 separate questions from Mr White. This is a very large number of detailed requests even though over 8 years, particularly the 9 month period prior to the Request. 22. The previous requests had been on different subject matters to the Request. DBC say they have provided detailed responses to many of Mr White’s previous requests. In 2014 an independent investigating officer who met with Mr White and his partner as part of a complaint investigation stated in her report that Mr White advised “..it is their ambition to make as many complaints as they possibly can to waste as much Council monies and time as possible and to cause as much hassle to the Council as possible..” 623. Mr White does not deny any of this. In fact there is further evidence before us that seems to confirm his desire to cause a burden on DBC when a different officer visited Mr White and his partner as evidenced in an email dated 8 January 2015. 24. In addition to what was said to Council officials the DBC provided the Commissioner with a blog that they say was posted by Mr While boasting that the way to upset DBC was to bombard the Council with FOI requests. However no collaborative evidence has been provided to link the blog to Mr White, despite DBC’s suspicions. 25. We have been provided with email chains in relation to Mr White’s dealings with DBC over a number of his requests. It would appear whenever DBC had taken more than 20 days (even by a few days) to respond to the request, although often providing the information Mr White repeatedly asked for an internal review on the basis that the response was late. The Council seems to have apologised for the lateness. However, the persistent engagement of DBC's internal review process on such a point suggests to us that Mr White’s course of conduct tends towards deliberately and unnecessarily increasing its burden. These are multi- question requests which are likely to take longer to deal with than simpler requests. The Request itself contains 16 separate questions. Mr White’s motive 26. FOIA claims are generally regarded as motive-blind. There are exceptions and one of them is in relation to section 14(1) cases as recognised by the Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal. We can therefore take this into account when considering whether the Request is vexatious. 27. The Request, although having 16 parts, seems entirely reasonable in itself, albeit some parts relate to personal interests. However the history of previous large numbers of requests as set out above suggests a possible ulterior motive, namely to place an unreasonable burden on DBC. The fact 7that one of Mr White’s grounds of appeal is that he requires the information in relation to a Supreme Court case suggests this might be the case. As the Commissioner states in his response, this ground is “misconceived” and FOI is not the correct process to obtain information in other litigation. There is other evidence before us that Mr White has in the past pursued the FOI route rather than the correct appeal process in a housing benefit matter as set out in the letter of 1 April 2015, despite this being pointed out to him. Other broad issues 28. Other issues we can consider are the value and serious purpose of the request; and whether the request causes harassment of, or distress to, staff. 29. On the basis of the Request in itself there is clearly a serious purpose in understanding how the “bedroom tax” works and is applied by DBC. There is not only value to Mr White but to the wider community who will be affected by the tax. 30. The Request is in temperate language and nothing relating to it suggests that, in itself, it would have caused harassment or distress to staff. 31. However, considered in the context of multiple requests made over a number of years and Mr White’s apparent intention to disrupt DBC as expressed to others, the Request seems to us to be part of a course of conduct amounting to manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Conclusion 32. On the basis of the evidence before us we find that the Request is vexatious. The number of requests, particularly in the year prior to the Request, has clearly been a heavy burden on DBC and there is no indication that this will stop or reduce in the future. Mr White seems to be 8bent on a course of action designed to disrupt the Council’s business. DBC is entitled to say “enough is enough”. 33. We dismiss the appeal and uphold the DN.

"44","Substantive Refusal","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) EA/2015/0044 B E T W E E N:- JACQUELINE RICHARDS Appellant -and- THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Tribunal Brian Kennedy QC Roger Creedon David Wilkinson Hearing: On the papers - 1st December 2015, Location: Field House, London. Decision: Appeal Refused. . Subject Matter: Whether or not the information requested is personal data engaging s. 40(1) and (2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and whether or not disclosure would breach the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the DPA”) making it exempt. Result: Appeal Refused. Date of Decision: 31 December 2015Introduction: 1] This is an appeal against a Decision Notice (“the DN’”) issued by the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) dated 11 February 2015, (Reference FS50531172) involving Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council (“the Council”). The DN related to a request for information made to the Council on 28 January 2014. Background: 2] The background to the request is that on 28 January 2014, the Appellant made an information request to the Council for; ”I would request all information held on how you formulated these accusations, and how we were not interviewed prior to this libelous information documentation I would be interested in any information held by your organisation regarding my request. I understand that I do not have to specify particular files of documents and that it is the departments responsibility to provide the information I require. I would like to receive the information in photo copy.” . (See DN Para. 4). Further correspondence followed, as detailed at paragraphs 5 & 6 of the DN. 3] The Appellant contacted the Commissioner to complain about the way her request for information had been handled. The Commissioner considered the request was for the Appellant’s personal data and the Appellant was advised to submit a Subject Access Request (“SAR”) under the DPA. The Appellant made a SAR to the Council and was provided with a copy of the personal data she was entitled to under the DPA. The Commissioner’s case was therefore closed. 4] The Appellant subsequently contacted the Commissioner on 21 October 2014 to request a decision notice that considered the request under the terms of the FOIA. The Commissioner investigated the concern. In his DN the Commissioner found that the Appellant’s personal data is exempt under s .40 (1) of the FOIA and the remaining information caught by the request is the personal data of third parties and was exempt under s.40(2) of the FOIA. The Legal Framework: 5] Under section 1 of the FOIA, any person is entitled to: a) be informed whether the relevant public authority holds the requested information - section 1(1)(a); and b) have that information communicated to them - section 1 (1)(b). 6] Section 1(1)(b) provides that a public authority is obliged to communicate the requested information to the individual requester. 7] However, section 1(1)(b) is qualified by section 2(2), which establishes that a public authority is not obliged to provide the requested information where an exemption applies. The relevant exemptions in this case are sections 40(1) and 40(2).8] Section 40(1) of FOIA provides: “ …. Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject.” 9] Thus under section 40(1), if some or all of the requested information can be said to be the personal data of the individual who has requested it; then such information is automatically excluded from disclosure under FOIA. 10] However, the individual may be able to access that information by making a subject access request under the DPA. The Appellant made a subject access request. 11] Section 40(2) of the Act can be summarised as stating that information is exempt if it is the personal data of an individual other than the Appellant and if the disclosure of that information would breach any of the data protection principles. The Commissioners’ analysis: 12] In considering whether section 40(2) is engaged; the Commissioner addressed two sequential issues firstly, could the requested information be said to amount to personal data and if so, would disclosure of personal data breach any of the relevant data protection principles. 13] Section 1 (1) of the DPA, which defines personal data as follows: “ …. Personal data – means data, which relate to a living individual who can be identified - (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller …” 14] Further, certain categories of personal data are given additional protection by the DPA because such information is considered particularly sensitive and private. Sensitive personal data is defined in section 2 of the DPA. 15] When deciding whether it would be fair to disclose the requested information, the Commissioner firstly considered whether it would be fair to confirm or deny. The Commissioner took into account the following factors: a) Whether confirmation or denial would be within the data subject reasonable expectations; b) What if any, consequences would flow from the and any disclosure is provided to the individual; the act operates on the principle that any response by a public authority is effectively made to the world at large.; andc) Whether there are any legitimate public interests in the public authority confirming or denying whether it also requested information, 16] The Commissioner's view is that although any request is submitted by an individual requester and any confirmation or denial and any disclosure is provided to that individual; the Act operates on the principle that any response by a public authority is effectively made to the world at large. 17] Further, the Commissioner argued that the Act operates on an applicant blind and motive blind basis. It is for these reasons, the Commissioner concludes, that the application of any exemption takes into account the impact, if any, on the world at large rather than on the individual request. 18] Pausing here, this Tribunal accepts the Commissioners’ understanding, interpretation and approach in his analysis as set out above herein and accept and adopts it for the purposes of, and in so far as it is relevant to, this appeal. The Decision Notice: 19] The Commissioner in his DN concluded: a) Having considered the information that the council subsequently provided to the Appellant through a SAR under the DPA, the Commissioner was satisfied that that information related specifically to the Appellant. The Commissioner was therefore satisfied that that information constituted the personal data of the Appellant. As such the Commissioner considered that that it was exempt from disclosure under section 40(1) of the FOIA and the Council had been correct to consider its disclosure under the terms of the DPA. b) The Commissioner had also been provided with the information that the council had considered fell within the scope of the request but was not the Appellant's personal data. Having reviewed the withheld information, which consisted of care records held by the council's social services office, the Commissioner considered the information expressly related to private individuals, council employees and other third parties. The Commissioner considered that the information was clearly ‘personal data’. The Commissioner further concluded that the majority of the withheld information represented the sensitive personal information of individuals. c) In deciding whether disclosure would be fair, the Commissioner took into account the reasonable expectations of the individual as to what might happen to the individual's data, the consequences of disclosure and any legitimate interest in disclosure. (see DN/22 – 25) d) The Commissioner considered it was clear that the information had been created by the Council as part of its duty to provide social care services and contained a substantial proportion of sensitive personal data. As such, the Commissioner considered that none of the relevant third parties would have had a reasonable expectation that the information would be disclosed into the public domain under the FOIA.e) The Commissioner further considered that the release of the withheld personal data would disclose highly detailed and sensitive information about multiple third parties and their involvement in a social services matter. As such the commission considered it reasonable to conclude the disclosure might place these parties at risk of harm. f) The Commissioner did not identify any legitimate interests in disclosure. The requested information related specifically to named individuals and any concerns held by the Appellant about the Council’s social services office in this matter would need to have been referred to the appropriate authority. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal: 20] The Appellant has raised the following issues : (a) Why allegations were made against the appellant and her husband; (b) The Appellant is not of the opinion she asked for the personal data of any individuals although she agrees that the information relates to individual; (c) The Appellant is of the opinion that unfounded allegations were made against her husband and she disagrees it would be unfair to the third parties to disclose their personal data; (d) The Appellant wishes to see the evidence which formed the basis of the allegations and wishes to make it public, she appears to be concerned that the council is covering up gross misconduct by the staff; Reasons: 21] The Appellant has failed to persuade this Tribunal that the Commissioner was wrong in his analysis of the Law or that he failed to take into account any relevant matters that he should have considered in his investigation, or that he took into account any matters that he should not have and further the Appellant has failed to persuade us that the Commissioner was wrong in his reasoning or his conclusion in his DN as set out above. We have considered carefully the Commissioners’ investigation and reasoning and we accept and adopt his conclusion therein. 13] Neither the Commissioner nor this Tribunal can answer the Appellant’s queries or concerns. This Tribunal cannot provide either the reasons why allegations may or may not have been made, or the form of relief sought by the Appellant in relation to removal of names in data held by the Council. 14] Accordingly, we dismiss the Appeal and uphold the Commissioner’s DN.

REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Issues relating to the use of intercept evidence and intercepted material within the justice system in the UK – particularly in criminal trials – is a matter of high importance. 2. “Intercept material” is the conventional term for information derived from the covert interception of private communications such as a telephone -2-call, an email, text message or a private message sent via a social media platform such as Facebook. 3. Since 1985, the use of intercept material as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings has been prohibited in the UK. 4. Historically the two pieces of statutory legislation that prohibit this are section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and, subsequently, under section 17 (1) (a) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). 5. Of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe, the UK is the only country with the statutory prohibition against the use of intercept as evidence. Intercept evidence is also regularly used in criminal proceedings in other common law jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. 6. The UK’s statutory ban on the use of intercept as evidence has been repeatedly criticised by senior police officers, prosecutors, judges, NGOs and parliamentarians. In 2000, Lord Lloyd Berwick – a former Law Lord and the first independent reviewer of terrorism legislation – told Parliament: We have here a valuable source of evidence to convicted criminals. It is especially valuable for convicting terrorist offenders because in cases involving terrorist crime it is very difficult to get any other evidence which can be adduced in court, for reasons with which we are all familiar. We know who the terrorists are, but we exclude the only evidence which has any chance of getting them convicted; we are the only country in the world to do so.1 7. In November 2001, the proposal to detain suspected foreign terrorists indefinitely without charge under what became Part 4 of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 was justified by one Home Office Minister in the following terms: If we could prosecute on the basis of the available evidence in open court, we would do so. There are circumstances in which we simply 1 Hansard, HL Debates 19 June 2000, col 109 – 110). -3-cannot do that because we do not use intercept evidence in our courts.2 8. Since 2001, the difficulty of prosecuting terrorism offences has also been cited by successive governments as justification for a number of other exceptional anti-terrorism measures, including extended pre-charged detention, control orders and terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs). 9. In 2007, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights referred to Steadily mounting evidence that the prohibition on the use of intercept as evidence is widely considered to be one of the principal obstacles to bringing more successful prosecutions of people suspected of involvement with terrorism.3 10. That Joint Committee concluded: We are satisfied that the evidence of the DPP and the former Attorney General puts the matter beyond doubt: that the ability to use intercept as evidence would be of enormous benefit in bringing prosecutions against terrorists in circumstances where prosecutions cannot currently be brought, and that the current prohibition is the single biggest obstacle to bringing more prosecutions terrorism. We recommend that this be taken as premise of forthcoming review by the Privy Council. The difficult question is not whether the current ban on the evidential use of intercept should be relaxed, but how to overcome the practical obstacles to such a relaxation.4 11. In the same month as the Joint Committee reported in 2007, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a Privy Council Review To advise on whether a regime to allow the use of intercepted material in court can be devised that facilitates bringing cases to trial while meeting the overriding imperative to safeguard national security. It will consider: The benefits that might reasonably be expected to result from such use (in terms, for example, of increases in the number of successful prosecutions in serious organised crime and terrorism cases); The risks, including from exposure of interception capabilities and techniques; The resource implications of any changes in the law; The implications of new communications technology; and 2 Lord Rooker, Hansard, HL Debates 27 November 2001, col 146.) 3 Counter-Terrorism Policy and Human Rights: 28 days, intercept and post-charge questioning, HL 157/HC 394, 16 July 2007 [107]. 4 Ibid [126]. -4-The experiences of other countries and their relevance to the UK.5 12. Following the report to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary by the Privy Council Review of Intercept as Evidence,6 the Government then commissioned a programme of work to implement the recommendations of the Privy Council Review. The report had recommended, among other things, that “intercept as evidence should be introduced”.7 It also set out certain operational tests that would have to be met in order to meet the concerns of the Intelligence Services, among others. 13. The programme of work to implement these recommendations focused on model known as “Public Interest Immunity Plus”. The implementation team was led by the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism in the Home Office and was carried out under the supervision of an Advisory Group of Privy Councillors. 14. That subsequent December 2009 report, Intercept as Evidence, set out the findings and conclusions of the programme of work.8 In his Foreword to that report the Home Secretary, Alan Johnson MP, stated: ….These confirm the potential gains from a workable scheme for intercept as evidence and that, while requiring significant additional funding, the model developed would be broadly consistent with the operational requirements identified. However, it is also the case that the model would not be legally viable, in terms of ensuring continued fairness at trial. The results would not only be potential miscarriages of justice and more expensive and complex trials but also more of the guilty walking free [emphasis added]. These findings are such that no responsible government could proceed with implementation on this basis. The Advisory Group concurs with this overall judgement. At the same time, both the Government and the Advisory Group believe that the potential gains from intercept as evidence justify further work, in order to establish whether the problems identified are capable of being resolved…. The issues involved are complex and difficult, and addressing them commensurately challenging. But the importance of our interception 5 25 July 2007. 6 Report, Cmd 7324, January 2008.

The report stated that “the sensitivities involved mean that the full weight of supporting evidence cannot be made public”.10 It had, however, been made available to Ministers and to the Advisory Group of Privy Councillors.11 This was said to include legal advice from independent Counsel.12 The request for information 16. It was against this background that the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law (the Appellant) requested from the Home Office, on 13 November 2012, the following information: Please would you supply us with the following information: a copy of the independent legal advice referred to in the report Intercept as Evidence (Cm 7760 December 2009). 17. On 11 January 2013 the Home Office told the Appellant that the requested information was exempt from disclosure. The Home Office relied on the FOIA exemptions in section 24 (1) in relation to national security, section 31 (1) in relation to law enforcement, section 35 (1) in relation to the formulation government policy and section 42 (1) in respect of legal professional privilege. It also relied on section 23 FOIA to neither confirm nor deny whether it held information supplied by all relating to bodies dealing with security matters. 18. An internal review was requested by the Appellant on 10 March 2013. The Home Office responded on 18 June 2013 upholding its original analysis but clarifying that it was claiming that the section 42 (1) exemption applied to all of the withheld information. 9 Ibid 4. 10 Ibid 6. 11 The Advisory Group comprised of Sir John Chilcot, Lord Archer of Sandwell, Sir Alan Beith MP and Michael Howard QC MP. 12 Ibid 9. -6-The complaint to the Information Commissioner 19. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 18 June 2013. That complaint resulted in the Decision Notice of 24 March 2014. 20. That Decision Notice focused on the application of section 42 (1) in relation to the withheld information and did not consider any of the other exemptions claimed by the Home Office. It concluded that section 42 (1) was engaged and that the Public Interest Balancing Test (PBIT) favoured maintaining the exemption. The Decision Notice observed in particular the comments in Bellamy13 that …. there is a strong element of public interest inbuilt into the privilege itself. At least equally strong countervailing considerations would need to be adduced to override that inbuilt public interest. The appeal to the Tribunal 21. The Appellant submitted its appeal to the Tribunal on 22 April 2014. 22. In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellant conceded that section 42 (1) was engaged. It disputed that the PIBT favoured maintaining the exemption. In essence the Appellant considered that the Commissioner’s analysis of the factors to be considered in evaluating PIBT was fundamentally flawed. 23. There was then and oral hearing with no live witnesses on 10 September 2014. The Home Office had not been joined as a party to those proceedings. 24. The decision that Tribunal reached on 19 September 2014 was appealed to the Upper Tribunal (AAC). The original Tribunal result was overturned 13 Bellamy v IC v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry EA/2005/0023. -7-by Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley.14 He ordered a full oral rehearing before a new Tribunal. 25. It is that rehearing that is the subject of this decision. Evidence 26. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from Ms Katy Hancock. She adopted her Open written witness statement dated 20 October 2015 and she was cross-examined on this by Counsel for the Appellant. 27. Her written witness statement had redactions and the Tribunal heard further evidence from her in closed session in relation the information that had been redacted as well and seeing the withheld information in its entirety. 28. In her Open evidence she explained that she had worked at the Home Office for six years and within interception policy for a period of over four months. 29. Before working on interception policy she had worked as a senior analyst at the Cabinet Office. 30. She was aware of only two other cases in relation to the government where a department had been ordered to disclose section 42 legal advice on public interest grounds and, in her view, neither of those cases bore any similarity to this matter. 31. She observed that the Home Office had not originally been joined to the appeal proceedings in September 2014 because it had been decided for cost reasons that it would rely on the submissions from the Commissioner. 14 Home Office v IC and Bingham Centre for Rule of Law [2015] UKUT 0308 (AAC). -8-32. She believed the Home Office thinking had been based on observations similar to those made in Cabinet Office v IC & Aitchison where it had been observed that it was difficult to imagine anything other than the rarest case where legal professional privilege should be waived in favour of public disclosure.15 33. She stated that the legal advice in question had been commissioned by the Home Office Legal Advisers and policy officials on the understanding that it would be treated as legally privileged material. 34. In the Intercept as Evidence December 2009 report a short excerpt of the conclusions of the advice had been included. The decision to release a summary of the advice in the report had been taken because the Home Office felt that it was sensible reasonable approach that allowed the public to have some insight into the process while maintaining the confidentiality of the substance and detail of the advice itself. 35. Providing a summary or gist of the advice allowed the public to understand the basis for the government’s position, while at the same time protecting the details that required protection. The public interest, she believed, had been met by the publication of the report which identified the varying legal models for the use of intercept material as evidence and comments on the conclusions presented by the independent legal advice. 36. She maintained that the Home Office had a legitimate expectation of confidentiality in the legal advice it had sought. The government and its officials had a mandate – as well as the responsibility – to formulate, develop and put forward for consideration appropriate policies that advanced the national interest. 37. The public expected decisions taken by government to be taken on the basis of good quality legal advice and that in itself was an aspect of the public interest. That was particularly compelling in the area of law enforcement and counter terrorism. The issues were complicated, fast- 15 Cabinet Office v IC & Aitchison [2013] UKUT 26 (AAC). -9-moving and often sensitive. Government departments needed high-quality comprehensive legal advice for the effective conduct of its day-to-day business. The advice needed to be given in a timely fashion to ensure the policy developed in a fully informed way. Legal advisors needed to be able to present the full picture to their clients including not only arguments in support of their conclusions but also the potential counter-arguments, in order to assess the merits of each. 38. Legal advice obtained by government departments often set out – within its reasoning – the perceived weaknesses of the department’s position, or counter-arguments that might be made. That material helped provide the government with comprehensive legal advice. Without such comprehensive advice, the quality of the government’s decision-making would be “much reduced because it would not be fully informed”. 39. Revealing the perceived weaknesses and counter-arguments would provide a clear path the disaffected parties to mount case. That would be contrary to the public interest and was an important consideration in the issues under review in the appeal. It could also create a situation of unfairness since other parties to litigation would not be forced to reveal what legal advice they had received. 40. Disclosure of legal advice would prejudice the government’s ability to defend its legal interests because it would mean unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge thus diminishing the reliance it could place on the advice being fully considered and presented without fear or favour. Neither of those outcomes was in the public interest. The former could result in serious consequential loss – or at least in a waste of resources in defending unnecessary challenges – and the latter could result in poorer decision-making. 41. There was also a risk that lawyers and clients would avoid making a permanent record of the advice given, or make any partial record. It was in the public interest that the provision of legal advice was fully recorded in - 10 -writing. As policy developed or litigation decisions were made it would be important to be able to refer back to advice given along the way. It was in the public interest that the record described the process of decision- making accurately and fully and the legal advice should be part of that record. A worst-case scenario would be a reluctance to seek advice at all and that could lead to decisions being made that would legally flawed. 42. In this case, if the legal advice in question was disclosed in its entirety it would provide – in essence – a road map for future challenges should the government in future decide to amend the framework. The advice set out in great detail the challenges of any changes to the system. Should those be made public it would inhibit the government from future revisions to the policy on the basis that potential weaknesses had already been spelt out in detail putting the government at a decisive disadvantage in the inevitable litigation that would follow. That would not be in the public interest and – in this case – it was imperative that the legal advice was protected in order to ensure future policy development on the topic was conducted thoroughly, and that officials did not feel that they had to shy away from being as open and transparent as they could be. She believed the approach taken in this particular case struck the correct balance by being as open and transparent as possible. 43. In relation to the Security Services exemption (section 23) she stated it was possible to argue that the entirety of the disputed information might be considered exempt under section 23 (1) – on the grounds that it broadly related to the work of bodies listed at section 23 (3) – but the Home Office was relying only on that exemption only insofar as it made explicit references to capabilities or challenges faced by section 23 bodies. 44. The public association between interception and the security intelligence agencies (SIA) had been the reason behind the Home Office decision to set aside its reliance on the “neither confirm nor deny” provision in section 23 (5). - 11 -45. She added that the issue of intercept evidence was “live” and was likely to remain so. The public interest in revealing the advice was limited in that it was already known that the advice set out the difficulties in reform. 46. She stated (in Paragraphs 28 – 30) of her open witness statement: The disputed information provides advice on how different options might function. It serves to provide officials with the basis on which to take forward policy formulation, enabling informed discussion and decision-making. As with any area of life policy, what is considered one point may be revised or set aside for use at a later point. In this respect the disputed information has enduring relevance to the policy formulation. Intercept as evidence is a sensitive issue, with a great deal of public speculation on whether or and how the government might wish to adapt the legal system to accommodate material obtained through interception. More so than many other areas of current government policy there is pressure from both groups and individuals to shape the debate around this issue and in a manner that supports their own particular narrative; the intention being to exert pressure on the policy process in order to promote a particular political or ideological considerations. In the face of pressure to introduce interceptors evidence in order to increase the number of successful prosecutions in serious crime and national security cases, eight reviews have been undertaken since 1993. The most recent review published its findings in 2014. The 2014 review went further than any previous review by considering the costs and benefits of an intercept as evidence regime, even if that meant considerable operational upheaval for the intercepting agencies. The review found that the substantial costs (between £4.25 billion and £9.25 billion over 20 years) outweighed the uncertain benefits. But the very fact that such a detailed review was published in 2014 (some two years after the date of the request) indicates that, at the time of the request in this case, the issue was very much a “live” one. I do not therefore think that it would be correct to characterise intercept evidence as “not live” in that way and in this context, as has been suggested. 47. Then, at the conclusion of Ms Hancock’s closed oral evidence, Mr Pievsky as Counsel for the Home Office, summarised what had been dealt with in the following way in open court: During the Closed Session Ms Hancock (a) referred to the information in dispute in order to clarify who commissioned and made use of the legal advice; - 12 -(b) confirmed her written Closed evidence as to the paragraphs in the legal advice to which section 23 applied; and (c) confirmed her written Closed evidence that the party political detriments of disclosure were not her main concern in relation to special detriment. She added that harm could be caused by disclosure if a few defendants in criminal trials knew the content of the legal advice. Conclusion and remedy 48. The structure of the Tribunal’s reasons and conclusions in respect of this appeal follow the three areas of the FOIA exemptions relied on by the Home Office (and which are set out in the Appellant’s skeleton argument). These are section 42 (Legal Professional Privilege), section 35 (formulation of government policy, etc) and section 23 (Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters). 49. Before dealing with that, however, the Tribunal reminded itself of the recent guidance for the approach to be taken by courts and tribunals in respect of any closed material procedure. 50. In Bank Mellat v HMT (no.1) [2013] UKSC 38, which was not a case about FOIA, Lord Neuberger said at paragraphs 68-74 that: i) If closed material is necessary, the parties should try to minimise the extent of any closed hearing. ii) If there is a closed hearing, the lawyers representing the party relying on the closed material should give the excluded party as much information as possible about the closed documents relied on. iii) Where open and closed judgments are given, it is highly desirable that in the open judgment the judge/Tribunal (i) identifies every conclusion in the open judgment reached in whole or in part in the light of points made or evidence referred to in the closed judgment and (ii) says that this is what they have done. iv) A judge/Tribunal who has relied on closed material in a closed judgment should say in the open judgment as much as can properly be said about the closed material relied on. Any party excluded from the closed hearing should know as much as possible about the court’s reasoning, and the evidence and the arguments it has received. - 13 -51. In Browning v Information Commissioner and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [2013] UKUT 0236 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal issued similar guidance about the use of closed material and hearings in FOIA cases, noting that such practices are likely to be unavoidable in resolving disputes in this context: i) FOIA appeals are unlike criminal or other civil proceedings. The Tribunal’s function is investigative, i.e. it is not concerned with the resolution of an adversarial civil case based on competing interests. ii) Closed procedures may therefore be necessary, for consideration not only of the disputed material itself, but also of supporting evidence which itself attracts similar sensitivities. iii) Parliament did not intend disproportionate satellite litigation to arise from the use of closed procedures in FOIA cases. iv) Tribunals should take into account the Practice Note on Closed Material in Information Rights Cases (issued in May 2012). They should follow it or explain why they have decided not to do so. v) Throughout the proceedings, the Tribunal must keep under review whether information about closed material should be provided to an excluded party. 52. The closed bundle in this appeal contained the disputed information and the unredacted witness statement from Ms Hancock. 53. It was necessary for the Tribunal to see the disputed information – and consider the totality of it – in relation to the exemptions claimed. 54. The Tribunal has considered carefully and rigorously the Appellant’s points and concerns already expressed in the notice of appeal and in its other representations and submissions. 55. As a result of its conclusions and reasons the Tribunal’s decision is an open one with no closed, confidential annex. 56. The Tribunal does not propose to elaborate further on the information in the unredacted witness statement or – as a result of its decision generally – to give any further detail of the withheld information save that which was - 14 -in the open material. It is not possible to do so in any realistic or proportionate sense without defeating the object of maintaining the elements of the legal professional privilege. Section 42: Legal Professional Privilege LPP did not belong to the Home Office. 57. The Appellant challenged whether the advice in question was obtained for the Home Office for its own use but accepted that the section 42 (1) exemption was engaged on the basis that the information requested was independent legal advice and therefore covered by legal advice privilege. 58. The Tribunal does not consider that this was the Appellant’s strongest point either as a matter of law or fact. Having heard the evidence from Ms Hancock and considered the detailed cross-examination of her on this point the Tribunal is satisfied that it was the Home Office who procured the legal advice in question for the benefit of the Privy Council Advisory group and that – in so far as matters need to be stretched – the benefit of the Legal Professional Privilege attaches equally to the Home Office, as commissioners of the advice by and for the Privy Council. 59. The Tribunal has had the benefit of seeing and considering the written and oral evidence provided by Ms Hancock – both as open and closed material – and has also observed her evidence tested under cross examination by experienced Counsel for the Appellant. 60. The evidence she provided throughout was clear, cogent and credible. For that reason, the Tribunal accepts and attaches significant weight to the veracity of her open witness statement at Paragraph 7: The legal advice in question was commissioned by Home Office Legal Advisers and policy officials on the understanding that, as with all legal advice the Home Office commissions, it would be treated as legally privileged material. - 15 -Interests ordinarily underpinning LLP absent because of the cross-party nature of the issue. 61. To the Tribunal, this seemed a strained argument by the Appellant. Why it should lose the protection of LPP simply because – having been commissioned by the Home Office – it was being used in a cross-party sense by this Privy Council Advisory group was not clear. 62. Looking at which interests were served by the relevant legally privileged advice it seems clear to the Tribunal that this was part of an exercise where the Government needed advice – via the Privy Council Advisory group as commissioned by the Home Office – on the law and that needed that to be confidential and professional. It is hard to imagine more compelling public interest considerations operating behind such legal advice. It is legal professional advice as cogent and relevant in respect of when it was prepared and presented as it has remained with the passage of time. Disclosure of the legal advice involves no realistic possibility of prejudice to the government’s interests. 63. As stated above, the Tribunal believes it would be hard to find a more concrete example in the totality of the advice provided of something that would almost certainly prejudice the government’s interests whether at the time of the original request, now or looking forward to the future. 64. The Appellant accepts that the core justification for protecting LPP is the common law right of access to the courts and maintaining respect for the rule of law. It is settled law that that principle is necessarily subject to limitation in those circumstances where protecting LPP would otherwise undermine fundamental rights or the rule of law. 65. While Parliament, in enacting section 42 FOIA, made it a qualified rather than an absolute exemption that necessarily demonstrated that Parliament did indeed contemplate a range of potential circumstances in which the - 16 -public interest in maintaining LPP would give way to the public interest in the disclosure of legal advice. The memorable comment in relation to this is that that “Section 42 is not to be elevated ‘by the back-door’ to an absolute exemption”.16 66. However, considering Ms Hancock’s open evidence – without even praying in aid matters seen and considered in full in the withheld information – the following public interest factors she identified properly create an overwhelming weight on the nondisclosure side of the balance. These are (précised from her witness statement): (1) In the Intercept as Evidence December 2009 report a short excerpt of the conclusions of the advice had been included. This allowed the public to have some insight into the process while maintaining the confidentiality of the substance and detail of the advice itself. (2) Providing a summary or gist of the advice allowed the public to understand the basis for the government’s position, while at the same time protecting the details that required protection. (3) Publication of the report identified the varying legal models for the use of intercept material as evidence and comments on the conclusions presented by the independent legal advice. (4) The government and its officials had a mandate – as well as the responsibility – to formulate, develop and put forward for consideration appropriate policies that advanced the national interest. (5) In the area of law enforcement and counter terrorism the issues were complicated, fast-moving and often sensitive. Government departments needed high-quality comprehensive legal advice for the effective conduct of day-to-day business. The advice needed to be given in a timely fashion to ensure the policy developed in a fully informed way. Legal advisors needed to be able to present the full picture to their clients including not only arguments in support of their conclusions but also the potential counter-arguments, in order to assess the merits of each. (6) Legal advice obtained by government departments often set out – within its reasoning – the perceived weaknesses of the department’s position, or counter-arguments that might be made. That material helped provide the government with comprehensive legal advice. Without such comprehensive advice, the quality of the government’s decision-making would be “much reduced because it would not be fully informed”. 16 DBERR v O’Brien [2009] EWHC 164 (QB): Wyn Williams J [41]. - 17 -(7) Revealing the perceived weaknesses and counter-arguments would provide a clear path the disaffected parties to mount case. It could also create a situation of unfairness since other parties to litigation would not be forced to reveal what legal advice they had received. (8) Disclosure of legal advice would prejudice the government’s ability to defend its legal interests because it would mean unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge thus diminishing the reliance it could place on the advice being fully considered and presented without fear or favour. The former could result in serious consequential loss – or at least in a waste of resources in defending unnecessary challenges – and the latter could result in poorer decision-making. (9) There was also a risk that lawyers and clients would avoid making a permanent record of the advice given, or make any partial record. It was in the public interest that the provision of legal advice was fully recorded in writing. As policy developed or litigation decisions were made it would be important to be able to refer back to advice given along the way. (10) In this case, if the legal advice in question was disclosed in its entirety it would provide – in essence – a road map for future challenges should the government in future decide to amend the framework. The advice set out in great detail the challenges of any changes to the system. The “live” nature of the legal advice is a factor favouring disclosure in the present case. 67. For reasons already explained the Tribunal believes exactly the opposite applies to the withheld information. Disclosure of the legal advice would strengthen the government’s own development of its policy. 68. The Tribunal believes that, on the facts and given the nature of the withheld information in this appeal, just the opposite would obtain if the legal advice was disclosed. Disclosure of the legal advice would assist the administration of justice. 69. It is the Tribunal’s finding that disclosure of this legal advice – far from assisting in the administration of justice – would have a deleterious effect on it for reasons already explained. - 18 -70. In essence, it could provide a “road map” for future challenges should the government at another time decide to amend the framework in this delicate and sensitive area. Disclosure of the summary is not sufficient. 71. There are good reasons relating to the public interest balance why the summary is so carefully cast and why the legal advice lying behind that summary – despite being very detailed – is not elaborated on further. Section 35 (Formulation of government policy, etc) and Section 23 (Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters). 72. The Tribunal has considered these exemptions. It regards them as ancillary and subsumed by its main finding. 73. That main finding that the Home Office has properly relied on section 42 FOIA, that it is fully engaged and that – when the public interest balancing test is considered and concluded in terms of the fact that it is a qualified exemption – the balance falls squarely and unequivocally in withholding the information and maintaining the legal professional privilege exemption as originally claimed. 74. Our decision is unanimous. 75. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 9 December 2015 - 19 -"
"46","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) EA/2015/0119 Decision Notice Ref: FER0569249 WYATT PARK ROAD RESIDENTS’ GROUP Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Hearing Held at Field House, London on 30 October 2015 as an oral hearing. Before: Dave Sivers, Pieter de Waal, and Judge Claire Taylor Decision The appeal is unanimously upheld in part for the reasons set out below, such that we find partially in favour of the Appellant. Steps to be taken The Council are required to comply with the steps set out in paragraphs 22 and 23 below and in the Appendix to this decision. 1Our Reasons 1. The background to this appeal is set out at paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Response of the Information Commissioner’s (‘the Commissioner’) Response of 27 July 2015. 2. On 2 April 2014 the Appellant requested from the London Borough of Lambeth ('the Council’), the following as a ‘public authority’: i. “We would like ALL information you have on file about the waiver tree garages development site. We would need this to include the following…” (‘the Overarching Request’); and ii. The Appellant then listed 22 specific questions which are set out in the Decision Notice and are repeated in the Appendix to this decision (‘the Specific Questions’). 3. We understand that, on 6 May 2014, the Council responded to the Appellant providing some information, and in other cases stating that the information was not held or was accessible elsewhere, citing s.21 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ('FOIA') as being applicable such that it did not need to be provided. 4. The matter progressed with the Commissioner issuing a decision notice on 14 April 2015, the findings of which are summarised at paragraph 10 of the Commissioner’s Response of 27 July 2015. 5. The Appellant now appeals on grounds that are summarised at paragraph 12 of the Commissioner’s Response. 6. The Commissioner maintained in his Response that the grounds did not identify any respect in which (a) the decision made by the Commissioner was not in accordance with the law or, (b) where the Commissioner's decision involved exercising a discretion, he should have exercised it differently. On 24 June, the Tribunal Registrar asked questions of the Appellant to help clarify its position. The Commissioner subsequently made Additional Submissions on 24 September 2015. At paragraph 7 of that document the Commissioner summarised the Appellant’s submissions, which the Appellant confirmed to us was a fair summary. The Commissioner suggested that in view of this response, the Appellant had appealed the wrong decision notice. (The Commissioner had made a separate decision in relation to another request made by the Appellant, which is not the subject matter of this appeal.) The Appellant clarified their position at the hearing that the second request (which is not the subject of this appeal) was made as a consequence of not being given what they had asked for. However, they maintained that their Overarching Request included all aspects covered by paragraph 7 of the Commissioner’s Additional Submissions. As far as we know, the Appellant made no submissions to the Tribunal prior to the hearing. 7. The Appellant attended the oral hearing and submitted lengthy written submissions. Although these were made out of time, we accepted them in view of the Appellant not being legally represented. Further detailed submissions were made in answer to the panel’s questions, which were posed in order to help focus the Appellant on the issues relevant for the purposes of the appeal. These are summarised in the Appendix. The Commissioner did not attend the oral hearing. Whilst we directed that the Appellant's written submissions presented at the oral hearing be provided to the Commissioner, we did not convey to the Commissioner those submissions that were 2made verbally by the Appellant in response to the panel’s questions at the hearing. In view of rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-Tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 S.I. 2009 No. 1976 (L. 20) ('the Rules') and the overriding objective of dealing with the case fairly and justly including: <U+F0B7> dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to (a) the importance of the case; (b) the complexity of the issues; (c) the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties (and of the Tribunal); <U+F0B7> ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are able to participate fully in the proceedings; and <U+F0B7> avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues; We did not consider it appropriate for us to provide the Commissioner with the oral submissions. The Commissioner made the decision not to attend the hearing, such that any expectation to then be included in further submissions made at the hearing would not seem reasonable or in compliance with his duty under rule 2(4) of the Rules. 8. In their Notice of Appeal, the Appellant stated that they preferred an oral hearing but did not want the Council to be present at the hearing because the Appellant claimed that there had been a “tremendous amount of intimidation and threats” against them by both the Council and Hambridge Homes. The Council had not applied to be joined to this appeal and was not present at the hearing. At the direction of the Tribunal, the Appellant subsequently submitted to the Tribunal certain documents that she had referred to in the hearing. Contrary to our directions, the documents were not clearly labelled to show which document was being supplied to relate to which of the Specific Questions. However, acting proportionately within rule 2(2)(a) of the Rules, we have tried our best to decipher this. The documents included: i. A document entitled ‘Consultations for Reports to Planning Applications Committee’ which appeared to be ‘Document 10’ (see below); and ii. A letter from R Thackray (a former Councillor for the Green Party) of 1 November 2015. This stated: <U+F0B7> She and two other councillors had visited the portacabin office on the site of where Hambridge Homes were building, uninvited, on Friday 19 December 2014. <U+F0B7> The purpose was to explore the allegations made by members of the Appellant of the conduct of the construction manager and, in particular, an allegation of harassment. <U+F0B7> A spokesperson for the Appellant had said that the residents kept members' names secret because they had received aggressive threats from the Council via [X] and from Hambridge Homes to 'destabilise' their walls and to 'fix' them for making trouble. <U+F0B7> The construction manager showed them plans on his wall. However, she was not certain whether they were dated 2014. iii. A covering letter that noted that: <U+F0B7> An email had been sent to the Council asking for confirmation that the 4 year old planning notes was the most current information the Council 3had to hand. They claimed that the lawyer representing the Council had declined to answer. <U+F0B7> They were attaching an email from Streatham Councillor Scott Ainslee ‘confirming far more up to date actual plans’. (The Tribunal notes that the only email received from Scott Ainslee was dated 2 Nov 2015 11:29:and did not confirm this.) 9. The covering letter referred to in paragraph 8iii also sought to make further submissions which were extremely long and intricate. As noted above, the Appellant had already introduced lengthy written submissions at the hearing which we accepted and carefully reviewed with their representative to ascertain the Appellant’s arguments and to assist them. The Appellant’s submissions had not been forthcoming prior to the hearing (see above), and they had been refusing to attend the hearing with a printed bundle after having not provided a proper address (with a correct name) for service. This non-compliance with case management directions had complicated matters, where the directions are designed to make the process fair to all parties and to ensure that the appeal runs smoothly. The Tribunal made allowances for the Appellant not being legally represented. The Appellant had clearly gone to considerable effort to make further submissions both at the hearing and thereafter. However the Tribunal needs to have regard to what is reasonable and proportionate. Regrettably, within that context, it was not acceptable, proportionate or fair to the other party or to the Tribunal to introduce yet further submissions after completion of the hearing. Parties have a duty under rule 2(4) of the Rules to (a) help the Tribunal to further the overriding objective and (b) co-operate with the Tribunal generally. 10. Additionally, we note that it had been made clear to the Appellant which further documents could be submitted after the hearing and that these would need to be provided quickly. We did not include further submissions within that list. 11. We have reviewed all of the material submitted to us even if not specifically referred to below. We would note that the bundle was missing key documents that we would normally expect to see in a bundle, in line with the Hearing Bundles – Good Practice Guide 2015 issued by the Tribunal. These were: i. A clean copy of the Appellant’s request (we were given a document at page 69 of the bundle that seemed to include this but it included subsequent notes from the Appellant). ii. The Council’s response to the request. Instead we were provided with the covering email without the attachment. iii. The Council’s full internal review. We were provided with a chart that was labelled in the index as the outcome of the internal review, however it contained the Appellant’s subsequent comments so could not have been a clean version, and it did not contain the attachments referred to in the document. iv. The documents the Council claimed to have provided and/or to be available elsewhere. v. Attachments referred to in emails (for instance at page 76 of the bundle). 412. In view of the Council's decision not to apply to be joined as a party to the appeal and the Commissioner choosing not to attend the hearing, we did not consider it proportionate within the meaning of rule 2(2)(a) 1 of the Rules to seek this information. We took the view that there was sufficient information for us to come to a fair and just decision. The Task of the Tribunal 13. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’). This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law and, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising a discretion, whether he should have exercised it differently. 14. The Tribunal is independent of the Commissioner, and considers afresh the Appellant’s complaint. It is not within our remit to consider or comment on the Council’s compliance with any legislation aside from the Environmental Information Regulations ('EIR') or FOIA, or complaints of conduct in relation to the Commissioner’s handling of the Appellant’s complaint or, for instance, to comment on whether the development that is the subject matter of the request has or will have a detrimental impact. In this case, our remit is limited to considering whether the Council complied with the requirements under the EIR in responding to the Appellant’s request. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. The Law 15. It is not in dispute that this appeal concerns the EIR. Regulation 5(1) EIR requires a public authority holding ‘environmental information’ to make it available on request, subject to exceptions. Environmental information is defined in regulation 2(1) to include: “any information in written, ... electronic or any other material form on (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements...” The information requested in this case relates to the state of the elements of the environment, and specifically to land. 16. We received very limited submissions on the application of the law. In the absence of this we set out our understanding of the law to the extent it is relevant to this case. 17. Public authorities are under a general duty under the EIR to disclose up to date information where it is requested: “Duty to make available environmental information on request 5. - (1) Subject to paragraph (3) and in accordance with paragraphs (2), (4), (5) and (6) and the remaining provisions of this Part and Part 3 of these Regulations, 1 This provides: “(2) Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes— (a) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues, the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties;” 5a public authority that holds environmental information shall make it available on request… (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1), where the information made available is compiled by or on behalf of the public authority it shall be up to date, accurate and comparable, so far as the public authority reasonably believes...” (Regulation 5) “Form and format of information 6.—(1) Where an applicant requests that the information be made available in a particular form or format, a public authority shall make it so available, unless— … (b) the information is already publicly available and easily accessible to the applicant in another form or format…” (Regulation 6) 18. We know from regulation 12 that public authorities do not have to provide the information to the extent to which an ‘exception’ applies and in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in applying the exception outweighs that of disclosure. In considering the exception and public interest, a presumption must apply in favour of disclosure: Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information 12. (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if— (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure… (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that— (a) it does not hold that information when an applicant’s request is received… (c) the request for information is formulated in too general a manner and the public authority has complied with regulation 9; …” 19. Under regulation 9 EIR, public authorities must provide advice and assistance to applicants seeking information.2 This obligation is deemed to be satisfied where the authority has complied with a code of practice made under regulation 16 EIR: “9.— Advice and assistance 2 It is noted that for the exception in regulation 12(c) to be ‘engaged’, the request for information must be formulated in too general a manner and the public authority must have complied with regulation 9. 6(1) A public authority shall provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to applicants and prospective applicants. … (3) Where a code of practice has been made under regulation 16, and to the extent that a public authority conforms to that code in relation to the provision of advice and assistance in a particular case, it shall be taken to have complied with paragraph (1) in relation to that case.” (Regulation 9) 20. The code of practice3 provides: i. The duty on the public authority is to provide advice and assistance “so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so”. (Para. 9 of the code). ii. “Where the applicant does not describe the information sought in a way which would enable the public authority to identify or locate it, or the request is ambiguous, the authority should, as far as practicable, provide assistance to the applicant to enable him or her to describe more clearly the information requested.” (Para. 16 of the code). 21. Onus of Proof: The onus of persuading the Tribunal to allow an appeal against a decision notice (or any part of it) rests on the Appellant. Accordingly, where we state below that we have no reason for instance to believe that a document is false or that the information is not held, then we must find in favour of the Commissioner in accepting that the relevant document is not false or that it is not held, as the case may be. Our Findings The Overarching Request4 22. Neither the Commissioner nor the Council seem to have addressed this part of the request. We note from the decision notice that the Commissioner excluded it when he copied the Appellant's information request into paragraph 6 of his decision notice. We also note that, in the course of investigating the complaint with the Council, the Commissioner's Office did not address this part of the request. Since the Commissioner was not present at the hearing, he also did not address the matter then. There is also no indication that the Council responded to this part of the request, or that it applied any FOI exemption or EIR exception to it, or that it sought to advise and assist the Appellant in compliance with regulation 9 of EIR. The Council had the opportunity to respond to the request in its entirety (including the Overarching Request) and to apply any exceptions that it considered it wished to rely on. It additionally chose not to be joined to this appeal. Accordingly, we now find that the Commissioner's decision notice is not in accordance with the law and we allow the appeal by substituting, in respect of this part of the request, the following notice: 3 This refers to Code of Practice on the discharge of the obligations of public authorities under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3391), issued under Regulation 16 of the Regulations, February 2005. 4 See paragraph 2 of this decision. 7The Council has failed to comply with its obligation under regulation 5(1) of EIR, which provides: 5(1) Subject to paragraph (3) and in accordance with paragraphs (2), (4), (5) and (6) and the remaining provisions of this Part [2] and Part 3 of these Regulations, a public authority that holds environmental information shall make it available on request. i. The Council is required to provide the Appellant with the information specified in the Overarching Request in accordance with Regulation 5(1) of EIR within 10 days from the date of this decision save for as set out in subparagraph 22(ii) below. ii. We may not order disclosure of any information that falls within Regulations 12(3) and 13. The Appellant has not presented submissions in relation to this exception for personal data. Having regard to the overriding objective rule 2 (see paragraph 7 above) and in particular the need to avoid unnecessary delay and act proportionately, to the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the Appellant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with Regulation 13. Specific Questions5 23. Our findings in relation to the Specific Questions are set out in the Appendix to this decision in each row labelled ‘Tribunal’s finding’. To the extent that the Council did not adequately answer some of the Specific Questions, or failed to provide the Appellant with the most up-to-date documents that the Council held at the date of the request, or failed to advise and assist, we find that the Commissioner's decision notice is not in accordance with the law and we allow the appeal by substituting the following notice: In respect of Specific Questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 22, the Council is required to comply with the steps set out in the Appendix within 10 working days. 24. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Taylor 25 November 2015 Promulgated 27 November 2015 5 See paragraph 2 of this decision. 8The Appendix: Specific Questions Appellant’s Question 1: The name of the owner as well as the present contact Question details of the current development organisation/company responsible for the present development of the site. Council’s Response The Council’s original response: Planning application 10/04487/FUL was received on 23/12/2010 and granted planning permission on 20/12/2011. It provided the name and address of the applicant and its agent as listed on the planning application form; and the name and address of the person submitting discharge of condition applications and his agent. It stated that “details of the current owner of the site are publically accessible from Official Land Registry. Land Registry data is considered reasonably accessible to the public under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the Act) and, as such, the details of the owner are considered exempt under Section 21 of the Act. A link to the Land Registry website is included below: http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property- ownership” Appellant’s The Appellant accepts this position and has not appealed it. submission Tribunal’s finding The Appellant has accepted this position and there are no further steps to be taken. Appellant’s Question 2 The date and times of all the consultation meetings Question with local residents regarding the development of the site took place and who was invited and specifically how those concerned citizens i.e. *local residents were made aware firstly that meetings were being held and secondly of the time of the meetings and where the meetings were taking place? Council’s There is no requirement for the Local Planning Authority to carry out Response consultation meetings in advance of submission of a planning application. The Council can confirm that no consultation meetings were carried out by the Local Planning Authority in advance of submission of the planning application (ref: 10/04487/FUL). Details of the applicant’s pre-application consultation with neighbours are contained within the submitted planning statement by Turley Associates (see Document 07 enclosed with this response). The Council were not party to the pre-application consultation meetings and is unable to provide any further details in response to this question as no information is held by the authority in relation to this part of your request. Appellant’s The Appellant claimed there had been a meeting held by the Council, submissions where residents were invited, and this is what they were referring to. 9The panel thought this might be a council planning committee meeting rather than a consultation meeting. The Appellant claimed that since under the EIR, the Council had a duty to advise and assist, they should have been consulted to ascertain which meetings the Appellant meant. Tribunal’s We consider that, given that the Council did not have finding consultation meetings, and the Appellant may not have been aware of the distinction between consultation meetings and committee meetings or of the correct use of terminology, the Council should have consulted the Appellant in accordance with its duty to advise and assist to determine whether the Appellant required copies of details of committee meetings where residents may have been present and able to make comments to the committee. The Council is required within 10 working days to provide details of the council planning committee meetings relating to the development in accordance with terms of the request. Appellant’s Question 3: A list of names of all those that attended Question consultation meetings regarding the proposals of the Wavertree Garages Developers. Council’s As with question 2 Response Appellant’s As with question 2 submissions Tribunal’s As with question 2, the Council are required within 10 working finding days to provide details of the names of the persons who attended council planning committee meetings in relation to the development. Appellant’s Question 4: What information was given to those that attended Question the meetings? Council’s As with question 2 Response Appellant’s As with question 2 submissions Tribunal’s As with question 2, the Council are required within 10 working finding days to provide the information given to those who attended planning committee meetings in relation to the development. Appellant’s Question 5: The site’s plans for the health and safety Question requirements of the site particularly with regards to the ability of a fire vehicle to be able to make a 3 point turn safely within the space allowed i.e. in the event of a fire and they need to get in and out. We understand that the present measures fall short of the legal requirements. The engine does not currently have the legally required place to turn. Council’s Response Appellant’s The Appellant does not appeal the response to this question. submissions 10Tribunal’s This question is outside the scope of this appeal. finding Appellant’s Question 6: The date and time that the required notifications Question were placed on display making local residents particularly those whose gardens back onto the site. Council’s The Local Planning Authorities statutory consultation is detailed within Response the published officer report presented to Planning Applications Committee. This is attached to this response as Document 01 for ease of reference. This document is a public document and is available for download on the council’s Planning Applications Database by navigating to the following location: http://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?Cld=600&MI d=7598 The time that the site notices were posted is not detailed within the officer report as this is not a statutory requirement. No information is held by the authority in relation to this part of your request Appellant’s The Appellant has stated that they did not receive Document 01, and submissions the link produced a page on Lambeth’s site stating ‘Access denied Page does not exist.’ The Appellant further claimed that the Town and Country Planning Act (TCPA) requires notifications. Tribunal’s 1. Since Document 01 was not in the bundle, and the link finding does not work, we have no reason to doubt the Appellant’s submissions. The Council is required to provide this document within 15 working days. 2. Whilst the Appellant stated that they would look to provide proof that the TCPA required the public authority to keep records such that material in relation to Questions 6 and 7 must be held, the Appellant did not provide these. Accordingly, we have no reason to find that aside from the material in Document 01, the Council held any other information. Appellant’s Question 7: What form did notification of local residents take? Question Was it leaflets, emails, letters, newspaper notices... How many were printed/sent? Council’s See response to question 6. Response Appellant’s submission Tribunal’s See our findings at point 2 in question 6, which also apply to this finding question. Appellant’s Question 8: How many notices were put up for people to view the Question Developers plans/proposals where exactly each notification was placed and how long for? Council’s Details of the number of site notices posted is contained within the Response published officer report. The site notices were placed ‘near to the site’ as outlined by the case officer. The exact locations are not recorded 11on the application file. No information is held by the authority in relation to this part of your request. Appellant’s The Appellant did not believe that no information was held. submissions Tribunal’s finding The Appellant did not believe that no information was held. Since the Council did not attend the hearing, and the Appellant had not wanted it to, there was no way for the Tribunal to probe whether the information was held. In view of this, we have not been given compelling reason to be able to find that the information is held, and save for providing the document as set out in our finding in question 6, no steps are required to be taken. Appellant’s Question 9: Exactly how were the parking requirements met i.e. Question how many parking spaces did they claim were available? What was the date and time of day that the survey done? Council’s An officer assessment of car parking is detailed within Section 7.7 of Response the published officer report, which is a publically accessible document. Further officer commentary on parking is detailed within the published PAC minutes, which is attached as Document 03 for ease of reference. This document is a public document and is available for download on the council’s Planning Applications Database by navigating to the following location: http://moderngov.lambeth. gov.uk/ieListDocuments. aspx?Cld=600&Mld=7598 The officer report advises that no parking survey was submitted with the planning application (see paragraph 7.7.4). A copy of the Transport Statement submitted by the applicant is attached as Document 08 for ease of reference. This document is a public document and is available for download on the council’s Planning Applications Database by navigating to the following location: http://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online- applications/search.do?action=simple&searchType=Application Appellant’s The Appellant did not dispute that they had received Documents 03 submissions and 08. Tribunal’s finding Since the Tribunal has not been showed any of the documents mentioned in the Council’s response, it is not clear to the Tribunal that the Council has fully answered the question as to whether it held information in relation to this question. We understand from the Appellant that the answer is that the Council had undertaken an impact assessment for another area and the results of this were duplicated for this development. The Council must respond within 10 working days as to whether it holds further information to complete the response to this request and provide it, or otherwise confirm that the complete 12answer is that the Council had undertaken an impact assessment for another area and the results of this were duplicated for this development. Appellant’s Question 10: Please specify the impact these proposed Question developments will have on current local parking. Along with an explanation of how the impact was calculated. Council’s An officer assessment of car parking is detailed within Section 7.7 of Response the published officer report, which is a publically accessible document. Further officer commentary on parking is detailed within the published PAC minutes, which is attached as Document 03 for ease of reference. A copy of the Transport Statement submitted by the applicant is attached as Document 08 for ease of reference. Appellant’s The Appellant refuted Lambeth’s findings that the development would submissions not have a detrimental impact on local parking, as most residents find that they can't currently find anywhere to park on their road. Tribunal’s finding We have not been shown a copy of the published officer report. However, the Appellant has not disputed that it has not been given an answer to this request, albeit the Appellant may not agree with the answer. No steps are required to be taken. Appellant’s Question 11: Please list exactly who - which of the residents - Question were contacted to make them aware of the proposed plans for developing the Wavertree site Council’s Attached Document 10 contains a list of all neighbours consulted as Response part of the Local Planning Authority’s statutory consultation. A map is included at the end of this document with all consulted properties denoted with an ‘X’. Appellant’s Lambeth provided a fraudulent list as literally not one of the residents submissions mentioned on the list Lambeth provided received a letter. It looks as if Lambeth merely went on to Google maps and typed up a list. We are ALL prepared to swear and affidavit/oath to the fact that we did NOT receive a letter! We know because we checked with them ALL i.e. knocked on literally EVERY door. We’d also like to see a copy of the letter Lambeth claim to have sent. We’d also like to know the date the letter was sent and the method of post used. Tribunal’s finding The Appellant provided Document 10 after the hearing. We found no reason to doubt its authenticity from reviewing it, although the list is confusing because the title seems at one place to suggest that it is a list of neighbours who were consulted, and elsewhere that it is a list of neighbours who submitted responses (which, we assume, also means that they were consulted). Appellant’s Question 12: Please quantify with dates and exactly how i.e. the Question method that was used to contact the residents referred to in point 7 were contacted. 13Council’s Details of the Local Planning Authority’s statutory consultation is Response detailed within the published officer report presented to Planning Applications Committee. This is attached to this response as Document 01 for ease of reference. Appellant’s Lambeth failed to respond to this question. submissions Tribunal’s finding See our findings at point 2 under Question 6, which also apply to this question. Appellant’s Question 13: Please supply examples of the notifications that Question were sent. Council’s Copies of the neighbour consultation letter, site notice and press Response advert are attached as follows: Document 11 - Neighbour consultation letter Document 12 - Copy of site notice Document 13 - Copy of press advert Appellant’s The Appellant received these documents but thinks they are bogus as submissions they did not come on Council headed paper. Tribunal’s finding We were not provided with evidence to be able to find that there was information held that the Council had not supplied, and the Council were not present for us to examine the situation further. No steps are required to be taken. Appellant’s Question 14: Please confirm all those working with the Question Developing company that have a personal i.e. family/friend or have ever worked with any of the members of staff that either presently in the past have worked at the company presently developing the Wavertree site. Council’s The Council does not hold information on employee details of third Response party companies or organisations. No information is held by the authority in relation to this part of your request. Appellant’s submissions Tribunal’s We were not provided with evidence to be able to find that there finding was information held that the Council had not supplied, and the Council were not present for us to examine the situation further. No steps are required to be taken. Appellant’s Question 15: In the interest of the safety of all local residents, Question particularly those whose gardens back onto the development. How all the toxic waste from the petrol station is going to be excavated and disposed of i.e. with full details of the procedure to be undertaken? Council’s N/A Response Appellant’s The Appellant does not appeal the response to this question. submissions Tribunal’s This question is outside the scope of this appeal. 14finding Appellant’s Question 16: When did Wavertree Garage developers inform the Question *local residents of their proposed plans for schedule of works? Council’s This information isn’t held by the council. We would advise you to Response direct this question to the developer. Appellant’s The Appellant did not believe the information was not held by the submissions Council. Tribunal’s We were not provided with evidence to be able to find that there finding was information held that the Council had not supplied, and the Council were not present for us to examine the situation further. No steps are required to be taken. Appellant’s Question 17: How will the proposed development affect the Question houses/dwellings surrounding it enjoyment of daylight and sunlight? Council’s Response An officer assessment of residential amenity impacts including daylight and sunlight is detailed within Section 7.4 of the published officer report, which is a publically accessible document. An Overshadowing Report was submitted by the applicant as part of the planning application submission. This is a public document and is available for download on the Council’s Planning Applications Database by navigating to the following location: http://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/onlineapplications/search.do?action=si mple&searchType=Application Appellant’s submissions The Council supplied a report that was from 2010-2011. The Appellant claimed that a Councillor for the Green Party told the Appellant that he had visited Lambeth’s offices and a more up to date report exists. Tribunal’s After the hearing we were provided with additional documents: finding A letter from R Thackray and an email from Scott Ainslee. Neither of these documents indicate that the report they saw was more up to date than 2010-2011. We therefore have no reason to conclude that the Council did not provide the most up to date report that existed at the time of the request. However the Council did not make clear whether it supplied the most up to date report in accordance with EIR The Council are required to confirm within 10 working days whether a more up to date report existed at the date of the request, and if so to provide it. Appellant’s Question 18: What impact will the proposed development have Question on the privacy of the dwellings surrounding the site? Council’s Response An officer assessment of residential amenity impacts including privacy impacts is detailed within Section 7.4 of the published officer report, which is a publically accessible document. Appellant’s As with their submissions for Question 17. 15submission Tribunal’s See our findings for Question 17, which also apply to this finding question. Appellant’s Question 19: When will the developers of the site begin Question communicating with local residents? Plan and schedule Council’s This is a question that should be directed to the developer (Hambridge Response Homes) as the Council is unable to respond on behalf of, or pre-empt the actions of, a third party. It is noted that the Council’s Chief Executive was copied into a recent e-mail correspondence between Mr James Overton (Hambridge Homes) and a representative of WPRRG. This correspondence documents Mr Overton’s offer to enter into dialogue with WPRRG either by telephone or an on-site meeting. A copy of this correspondence is attached as Document 14. It should also be noted that the Council’s Environmental Health teams have carried out investigations into the current construction activity on the site in response to concerns expressed by local residents. This has included site visits to the property and dialogue with the developers Appellant’s The Appellants stated that they had contacted Hambridge Homes who submission referred them back to the Council. They claimed that given the agreement between Hambridge Homes and the Council required the former to communicate with local residents, it must hold the requested information in order to know whether Hambridge Homes was complying. Tribunal’s finding The Council have not addressed this question in terms required under the EIR. They should respond as to what information they hold in relation to the question and provide the requested information with 10 working days. Appellant’s Question 20: How many other developments from this particular Question development company/organisation within this borough has Lambeth ‘green lit’. Council’s N/A Response Appellant’s The Appellant does not appeal the response to this question. submission Tribunal’s This question is outside the scope of this appeal. finding Appellant’s Question 21: What relationship does Lambeth have with the Question developers of Wavertree Garages? Council’s The London Borough of Lambeth is the local planning authority that is Response empowered by law to exercise statutory town planning functions within its administrative area. As detailed in the previous response, the Local Planning Authority has determined 47 planning applications submitted by Hambridge Homes Limited. Appellant’s Lambeth provided another cagey seriously vague ‘legal’ answer, as in submission ‘not to 16their knowledge’. Tribunal’s The Council has responded that Hambridge Homes Limited is a finding planning applicant and we have no reason to find that this is not a comprehensive response to the question. Appellant’s Question 22: How the impact of the constant drilling into the Question ground will affect the structures of the dwellings surrounding the proposed development will be measured by whom and where. Council’s The Council is unable to provide a response to this question due to its Response speculative nature. In general terms, the builder has a duty of care not to damage adjoining buildings, but this does not fall within the Building Regulations, instead being a common law issue. Any damage claimed to be caused by the builder will of course have to be fully justified. This would have to be by way of documented evidence of the current state of a building prior to the works commencing and what has caused the purported damage because of works being undertaken on site. Appellant’s The Appellant states that given three garden walls had fallen down submission they consider information on this must be held. If the question was too speculative, the Council has a duty to advise and assist to help make the question more understandable. Tribunal’s finding The Council has not responded as to whether it holds any information that would respond to this question. They should respond as to what information they hold in relation to the question and provide the requested information with 10 working days. 17"

The Tribunal orders that NE disclose the withheld information within 30 days of the date of this decision. NE withdrew its appeal EA/2014/0234. REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. All of the appeals relate to the policy introduced by the Government in December 2011 to allow groups of farmers and landowners to apply for licences in certain areas to cull badgers with the purpose of preventing the spread of bovine tuberculosis (“bTB”) in cattle in those areas. Natural England (“NE”) issues those licences under section 10(2)(a) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. 2. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”) has issued Guidance 1 to NE concerning the grant of culling licences (“the Guidance”). The Guidance requires that the land be at least 150km2, access for culling to at least 70% of the total land area in the application, at least 90% of the land within the area must be accessible or within 200m of accessible area, the cull will be for a minimum of four years and all land holders covered by the agreement must permit access to land for culling. There is a 2km ring around each cull area, which relates to the perturbation of badgers, i.e. them 1 Guidance to Natural England – Licences to kill or take badgers for the purpose of preventing the spread of bovine TB under section 10(20(a) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 – published in 2011. 2Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 moving from the cull area into neighbouring areas and increasing the spread of disease. There are various other conditions in the Guidance concerning the effectiveness and humaneness of the cull. All applicants must submit a Badger Control Plan (“BCP”) to evidence how the conditions will be met. 3. The Guidance states that Government intervention will be “considered” (but need not necessarily occur) where various aspects of the Guidance are not met, including where the area of accessible land has dropped below 70%. 4. The cull policy was the subject of a pilot in two areas: West Gloucestershire (“WG”) and West Somerset (“WS”). Culling occurred in the summer and autumn of 2013, 2014 and 2015. North and West Dorset (“Dorset”) was designated as the reserve area, and (at the time of the hearing) a new cull had just started in Dorset. Information concerning the performance of those culls will be likely to impact on the development of badger culling policy. On 28 August 2015, Defra commenced a consultation process 2 concerning updating the Guidance issued to NE. The proposals include reducing the minimum area size to 100km2 and removing the 70% rule. 5. There is a significant amount of public interest and public debate over the policy to permit badger culling, including considerable opposition from many quarters. The Upper Tribunal described the badger culling policy in DEFRA v ICO & The Badger Trust [2014] UKUT 526 (AAC) as “controversial” at [12] and [80]. The appeals 6. During the case management process it was decided to hear the four appeals together because they involved similar evidence and legal issues. The cases were not consolidated. Anna Dale, one of the requesters, was joined as a respondent. During the course of the proceedings disputed information has been released and concessions have been made as to further information to 2 Consultation on guidance to Natural England on licences to control the risk of bovine tuberculosis from badgers – 28 August 2015. 3Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 be released. Prior to the hearing NE disclosed the information requested in EA/2014/0234 and formally withdrew its appeal at the hearing. As a result the scope of the appeals has much reduced and now revolve around the following requests: (1) The number of “landowners” who gave permission for badgers to be culled on their land in the WS and WG pilot areas [EA/2014/0311]; (2) The total area of each ring area or buffer zone in square kilometres for WG and WS: part 4(b) of the request in EA/2014/0094; and (3) The information in the BCPs of all applicants in the WG and WS Pilot Areas and the reserve pilot cull area for Dorset which has not already been disclosed, except for the applicants’ identity 3 and the area of each participant land holder or farm business which during the course of the hearing Ms Dale informed us she no longer required. The total cull areas were disclosed by Defra before the hearing, divided into accessible and inaccessible land, leading to NE’s disclosure of the percentage of participating land in each cull area during the appeal. So what is left in relation to the withheld parts of the BCPs is the length in Kms of the perimeter of the cull areas and the length in Kms of each kind of boundary (e.g. sea coast, lakes, motorways) and buffer (e.g. where farmers with vulnerable livestock have agreed to the risk of perturbation ) [EA/2014/0160]. So what is left is the detailed breakdown of the perimeter in terms of boundaries and buffer zones in Kms for each type of boundary (e.g. sea coast, lakes, motorways) and buffer (e.g. where farmers with vulnerable livestock have agreed to the risk of perturbation ) [EA/2014/0160]. 7. The relevant requests to NE were respectively made on 9 April 2013 (/0094), 2 May 2013 (/0160) and 10 October 2013 (/0311). The requests were responded to by NE on 30 April 2013, 5 June 2013 and 3 December 2013. 3 See letter from Ms Dale dated 2 May 2013 confirming she is not seeking the details of individuals. 4Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 The internal reviews were carried out on 19 July 2013, 19 August 2013 and 21 March 2014. These time points set the relevant scope for the Tribunal’s consideration of the application of the exceptions and the balance of the public interest. It is more complicated for appeal /0311 in that although Defra originally claimed it held the information but refused to disclose it on the basis of claimed exceptions, more recently Defra changed its position and now claims it does not hold the information. 8. Although the parties were at one time happy to allow the appeals to be considered on the papers it was later decided, during the case management process, that the appeals should be heard orally. Also under the same process certain parts of the undisclosed information and some evidence relating to the information were allowed to be considered in confidence under the First-tier Tribunal’s GRC rules of procedure. This meant that a small part of the hearing was held in closed session. Also two of NE’s witnesses were allowed to give evidence anonymously. The Legal Framework 9. The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“the EIR”) implement Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information (“the Directive”), which itself transposes relevant provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information (and other matters) (“Aarhus”). The Preamble to Aarhus states that the signatories recognise inter alia that in order to enable citizens to live in healthy environments and to protect and improve the environment for the benefit of present and future generations, “citizens must have access to information … in environmental matters”, and that “in the field of the environment, improved access to information and public participation in decision-making enhance the quality and the implementation of decisions, contribute to public awareness of environmental issues, give the public the opportunity to express its concerns and enable public authorities to take due account of such concerns”. These values condition the interpretation of the EIR. 5Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 10. It is well-recognised that the Directive, particularly through its recitals, imposes a clear general rule in favour of disclosure of environmental information. Those recitals include: “(1) Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of views, more effective participation by the public in environmental decision-making and, eventually, to a better environment. ... (8) It is necessary to ensure that any natural and legal person has a right of access to environmental information held by or for public authorities without his having to state an interest. (9) It is also necessary that public authorities make available and disseminate environmental information to the general public to the widest extent possible, in particular by using information and communication technologies. The future development of these technologies should be taken into account in the reporting on, and reviewing of, this Directive. ... (14) Public authorities should make environmental information available in the form or format requested by an applicant unless it is already publicly available in another form or format or it is reasonable to make it available in another form or format. In addition, public authorities should be required to make all reasonable efforts to maintain the environmental information held by or for them in forms or formats that are readily reproducible and accessible by electronic means. ... (16) The right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information in specific and clearly defined cases. Grounds for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way, whereby the public interest served by disclosure should be weighed against the interest served by the refusal. The reasons for a refusal should be provided to the applicant within the time limit laid down in this Directive.” (emphasis added) 11. Article 1(b) of the Directive additionally provides that an objective of the Directive is “to ensure that, as a matter of course, environmental information is progressively made available and disseminated to the public in order to achieve the widest possible systematic availability and dissemination to the public of environmental information”. 12. The CJEU has confirmed in Case C-71/10, Office of Communications v Information Commissioner [2011] PTSR 1676 at [22] that: 6Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 “It should be noted that, as is apparent from the scheme of Directive 2003/4/EC and, in particular, from the second sub-paragraph of article 4(2) thereof, and from recital 16 in the Preamble thereto, the right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information only in a few specific and clearly defined cases. The grounds for refusal should therefore be interpreted restrictively, in such a way that the public interest served by disclosure is weighed against the interest served by the refusal.”(emphasis added) 13. All the parties in these appeals agree that the information requested is environmental information as defined under regulation 2(1) EIR. 14. The EIR expressly implements the presumption in favour of disclosure in regulation 12(2): “A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure.” 15. There are three relevant exceptions to the ordinary position of disclosure for the Tribunal to consider in these appeals. These are firstly under regulation 12(4)(a), that: “For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that- (a) it does not hold the information when an applicant’s request is received;” and secondly under regulation 12(5), that: “(5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect – (a) international relations, defence, national security or public safety; ... (g) the protection of the environment to which the information relates”. 16. A public authority may only rely upon an exception in regulation 12(5) to permit non-disclosure of the information where “the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information”: regulation 12(1)(b). 17. Regulation 12(5) implements Article 4(2) of the Directive, which itself adopts the wording that the exceptions can only be relied upon “if disclosure of the information would adversely affect” (emphasis added) the relevant interest. The wording of regulation 12(5)(g) is materially identical to Article 4(2)(h). The 7Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 wording of regulation 12(5)(a) is slightly different to that of Article 4(2)(b), which is drafted in terms of “international relations, public security or national defence” (and this wording reflects that in Aarhus). 18. Although we are not bound by other decisions of the Information Tribunal and the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”), it is well-established that the presumption in favour of disclosure mandated by regulation 12(2) applies both to whether the exception is engaged and to the public interest balance, and requires “that in any case where there is doubt of the applicability of the exception that doubt must be resolved in favour of the disclosure i.e. the exception does not apply”: Burgess v Information Commissioner (EA/2006/0091) at [38]. We consider that this is the correct approach and adopt it in these appeals where relevant. We also accept that, as the FTT found in Burgess at [37], the adverse effect must be real, actual or of substance. The Defra appeal (/0311) 19. The request to Defra was for the information described in §6(1) above: The number of “landowners” who gave permission for badgers to be culled on their land in the pilot areas of WS and WG. At first Defra said they held the information. Then in a letter to Ms Dale dated 1 April 2015 they said that they were mistaken and did not hold the information. 20. Patrick Burke, a civil servant in Defra, provided 4 witness statements prior to the hearing explaining how this mistake and the delay in uncovering it had happened, and apologising for it. During the course of his evidence on the first day of the hearing it became clear that the searches undertaken had not involved some relevant Executive Agencies who were part of Defra. The tribunal asked Mr Burke to carry out further searches during the course of the hearing and on the third day a fifth statement was produced explaining that further searches had been made and the information was still not held. Whilst Defra may have held information on the land holders (the farmers, whether owners or tenants), it neither held nor had ready access to information on the owners of tenanted land. 8Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 21. In the light of the first 4 witness statements the Commissioner had already accepted before the hearing commenced that the information was not held. Ms Dale accepted that the information was not held following the fifth statement. Therefore the tribunal was not required to consider the matter further. On the evidence before us, however, we agree that Defra did not hold the information. 22. We therefore allow the appeal. 23. We would observe that much unnecessary time has been taken with the Defra appeal. If Defra had undertaken its searches properly and with reasonable effort and diligence at the time of the request, this appeal would no doubt have been avoided. We hope that Defra has learnt from its experience in this case so as to avoid unnecessary and costly mistakes in the future. 24. For the remainder of these reasons for the decision we refer to the remaining requested information described in §6(2) and (3) above (and requested from NE) as the “Withheld Information”. The evidence in the NE appeals (/0094 and /0160) NE’s evidence 25. The extensive evidence provided to us in these appeals relates to the background to the badger culls, the two exceptions claimed for refusing to disclose the Withheld Information, namely public safety and the protection of the environment, and the public interest test. 26. Two witnesses were given anonymity. 27. Witness A is the manager of the bTB licensing team within NE. The witness has day to day responsibility for the licensing regime that implements government policy on bTB and badger control. This is as a result of an agreement between NE and the Secretary of State (“SoS”) dated 29 9Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 September 2006 made under section 78 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 authorising NE to issue wildlife licences on behalf of the SoS. The authorisation includes granting licences under section 10(2)(a) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 (as amended) ‘for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease, to kill or take badgers, or to interfere with a badger sett, within an area specified in the licence by any means specified’. 28. NE is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by Defra. 29. The Government introduced a policy in 2011 – The Government’s policy on Bovine TB and badger control in England (“the Policy”) which allows groups of farmers and landowners in the worst affected areas to apply for licences to cull badgers. The Government also issued the Guidance to NE (referred to in §2 above) in relation to the granting of licences related to the cull. 30. The Policy and the Guidance set out criteria which must be met before a licence may be granted. The criteria have been derived from a trial carried out over a 10 year period (known as the ‘Randomised Badger Culling Trial’ (“RBCT”)). It is said that it is known from this trial that a controlled reduction of the badger population, carried out in accordance with strict criteria, will reduce the incidence of bTB in cattle in a local area. It will take time for the benefits to cattle bTB incidence to be realised (3-4 years) but, based on the results of the RBCT, if culling was conducted over an area of 150km2, after 9 years an average net reduction in bTB incidence of 16% across the culled area and 2km-wide ring of land (equating to the prevention of 47 cattle herd breakdowns relative to similar unculled areas) could be expected. The Guidance has set criteria which effectively seek to reflect the approach adopted as a consequence of the RBCT and therefore includes criteria relating to minimum area size, a minimum % access to the total land area and reasonable measures to mitigate the risk to non-participants. 31. The RBCT also found that culling was associated with an initial increase in cattle bTB in the 2km ring outside the culled area – the so-called ‘perturbation 10Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 effect’ – hypothesised to be due to disrupting the local badger population. (This ring is also sometimes referred to as the “buffer zone”). 32. Having assessed the known and estimated effects of badger culling and vaccination, Defra veterinary and scientific advice was that culling in high cattle bTB incidence areas, carried out in line with very specific licence criteria, would reduce the number of infected badgers and thus the weight of bTB infection in badger populations in the treatment area more quickly than vaccination, and therefore have a greater and more immediate beneficial impact on the spread of bTB to cattle and the incidence of infection in cattle. Accordingly, in order to help reduce the growing incidence of herd breakdowns in high incidence areas, and prevent spread of the disease, the Government introduced the Policy in December 2011 which allows groups of farmers and landowners in the worst affected areas to apply for licences to cull badgers. 33. Witness A explained that one of the key criteria that must be complied with in order to obtain a licence from NE is that, within the licence area, 70% of the land must be participating in the cull. This is one of the criteria that ensure the disease control benefits are achieved. If the percentage of participating land falls below 70% the cull cannot continue; new participants would need to be identified until the percentage of participating land is over 70% again, and a new licence granted. We note, however, that the Guidance states that Government intervention will be “considered” (but need not necessarily occur) where various aspects of the Guidance are not met, including where the area of accessible land has dropped below 70%. 34. Witness A explained that the Policy was piloted in two areas (WS and WG) in 2013 in order to assess the effectiveness (in terms of badger removal), humaneness and safety of controlled shooting. An independent expert panel (“IEP”) 4 reviewed the effectiveness of the pilot cull. It concluded that “controlled shooting alone (or in combination with cage trapping) did not 4 Pilot Badger Culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire March 2014 11Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 deliver the level of culling set by government” and that other targets were not met, but that it was “confident that controlled shooting can be carried out safely, even in the context of protester activity, if Best Practice Guidance is covered.” Following its assessment the Government determined that the culls would continue in 2014 in both WS and WG. 35. The IEP was only appointed to undertake an assessment of humaneness, effectiveness (in terms of numbers of badgers removed) and safety for the 2013 pilots. NE and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (an executive agency sponsored by Defra) (“APHA”) continue to be responsible for the assessment and monitoring roles. 36. For all three culls, licences were granted for a period of four years with a cull expected to take place over a 6 week period in the open season 5 in each of the four years. 37. Witness A concurs with the Commissioner and Ms Dale that the Policy is controversial and has provoked considerable public interest and debate. At one point NE was advised by the Police that, behind the peaceful face of the anti-cull movement, a more disruptive element had emerged. Seasoned protesters, ranging from veteran hunt saboteurs to animal rights extremists, have joined the badgers’ cause. 38. On 28 August 2015, the Government announced that the cull would continue in WS and WG and also be extended to Dorset. On 3 September 2015 the Government announced that culling had begun in the three areas. 39. Witness A explained that the reason for not disclosing the Withheld Information was to prevent the intimidation and harassment of those participating in the cull. Witness A claims that the level of intimidation and harassment has already been unprecedented in terms of the matters that NE regulates. 5 It is not possible to undertake the badger cull in the ‘closed season’ which for cage trapping and shooting is between 1 December to 31 May and for controlled shooting only is between 1 February and 31 May. 12Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 40. A High Court injunction was granted on 22 August 2013 6 prohibiting harassment of Protected Persons (i.e. certain named individuals), all farmers and land occupiers participating in the culls, employees, officers and members of the National Farmers’ Union (“NFU”), any person participating in the culls (including suppliers and contractors), and the families of such Protected Persons and other interference with the badger culls. Since then, contempt of court proceedings have been successfully taken in one case 7 where Jay Tiernan was subsequently sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years. 41. Witness A says that, by knowing the exact boundary of the Control Area (i.e. the area for culling), protesters can focus their activities such as disruption of contractors' sett survey work, searching for traps and removing or damaging them, identifying participating farmers and disrupting night time controlled shooting and contractor activity. If they carry out these activities in areas not within the Control Area they are wasting time, manpower and fuel for vehicles on areas where no culling will be carried out. By knowing the boundary, the protesters can also target landowners/farmers within the Control Area. She gave two examples of large Estates, one in Somerset and one in Gloucestershire, which experienced action from protesters once it was suspected they were taking part in the cull. It appears that the tactic behind this action was to try to get a large Estate to withdraw from culling and thus reduce the area of participating land to below the required 70%. Witness A quotes reports in the press and in social media in May 2013 to this effect prior to the licence activity starting. 42. Witness A gave examples of protester activities. These included entries on protester websites showing photos of an Estate owner with his landline and mobile number and other details, which were followed by abusive and intimidating phone calls (some in the middle of the night) and ‘threatening’ emails, and demonstrations at the Estate gate with chanting and verbal 6 National Farmers’ Union and Others v Jay Tiernan and Others (Case No: HQ13X04162) 7 NFU & Ors v Tiernan & Ors [2015] EWHC 69 (QB) 13Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 threats. A participant farmer reported his cattle had been let out of a field, and more than one participant complained people had shone torches in home windows at night. Additionally, contractors’ vehicles were followed at night and tracking devices hidden on the vehicles of contractors and participating farmers. 43. In evidence we were shown that the protesters had produced their own maps of the cull areas. These were being constantly modified. Witness A explained that if the Withheld Information was disclosed the protesters would be able to refine their maps leading to more accurate targeting of participating farmers which would lead to the intimidation and harassment of these farmers. 44. Witness A said that despite these incidents no participants in the cull had dropped out. 45. Witness A pointed out that recent disclosures (by Defra) of the percentage of participating land in WS and WG had already had the effect of targeting farmers taking part in the cull who might be persuaded to withdraw, and gave an example of a farmer who supplies M&S with asparagus. ‘Stop the Cull’ had advocated that protesters should write polite letters to M&S seeking to get the company to withdraw from its contract with the landowner. Witness A regarded this as a continuing example of harassment. 46. Witness A provided us with a table showing the number of cull traps damaged or removed in the cull areas in 2013, 2014 and so far in 2015. These were in the hundreds in 2013, a relatively small proportion of the total number of traps put in place. In 2014 the frequency of this activity was much less. There were no criminal prosecutions for trap damage or theft, largely because it is difficult to identify and catch the perpetrators. 47. Witness A also gave evidence in closed session. After the session a summary note was disclosed to Ms Dale. In effect it explained that Witness A gave oral evidence explaining the content of the Withheld Information found in the BCPs, what the information would tell a protester (or member of the public) 14Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 who received it, and how individual farmers could be identified from the hectarage figures in the BCPs. Questions were asked seeking to establish and test precisely how the Withheld Information could be used by anti-cull protesters to more accurately establish the pilot cull areas and boundaries. This questioning covered both the differences between the two pilot areas, and the differences between the categories of Withheld Information. 48. Witness B is employed by the NFU. The witness explained that, as a result of what she described as intimidation and harassment of farmers in WS and WG and criminal damage to traps, the NFU took action to obtain a High Court injunction against the protesters. In support of the court application, the NFU provided two lever arch files of evidence of incidents of harassment and intimidation. The incidents had been particularly bad leading up to July/August 2013. The injunction was granted on an interim basis on 22 August 2013 (just before the start of the cull) with a return date of 5 September 2013 when it was extended indefinitely. It still remains in place. As described by Witness A it is a very wide ranging injunction not just covering unlawful activities but also activities which would otherwise be lawful. The injunction applies to several District Council areas in various counties and appears to cover areas which are larger than just West Somerset, West Gloucestershire and North and West Dorset. It has been effective, although there have been a couple of committal proceedings. As mentioned, Mr Tiernan has been convicted. Another case was dropped, apparently on a technicality. Mr Tiernan committed breaches of the injunction which did not involve acts of violence or damage to property. 49. There are 55,000 members of the NFU. Only a proportion of farmers are members of the NFU. Most farmers in the cull areas support the cull but there are a substantial number of farmers who are against it. 50. Witness B gave evidence of the details of the incidents put before the High Court. These included signs being vandalised, some incidents of trespass, protesters wearing balaclavas or the like in a threatening way, a rape alarm going off near homes in order to waken residents, etc. There was no evidence 15Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 of physical injury, but according to Witness B farmers suffered considerable stress and fear due to protester activity. The witness was not aware of any medical or clinical injuries or issues relating to farmers or their families, but would not expect members to provide such information. 51. James Griffiths owns one of the farm estates referred to by Witness A. He gave evidence to us in open court. He is a dairy farmer in Gloucestershire. He explained that the pilot cull in WG started in August 2013 and then his family had been subjected to a campaign of harassment and intimidation carried out by protesters against the badger cull. He took us through incidents in 2013 and 2014 and a more recent one in September 2015 after the announcement that the cull would be continued. The incidents included frequent phone calls from protesters and others (some threatening, some in the middle of the night), vehicles parked at the top of the farm drive making farm access difficult, family members being followed in their cars, trespassing on his land including damage to the maize crop prior to harvest and particularly unsavoury behaviour close to his 83 year old mother’s house at the farm drive entrance which made her afraid. This activity was not only extremely disturbing to his family but also upsetting to his farm workers. 52. He cannot recall when his name became public in association with the pilot but the unwarranted telephone calls started in September 2013, at the beginning of the cull. Mr Griffiths was aware shortly before the hearing that he was among 25 farmers in his vicinity named (with personal details published) on the Stop the Cull website, and as a result received further silent and abusive calls. He spoke to about 6 others at the time, and knew that another farmer had contacted some of the others to offer solidarity. Some were angry and upset by the calls, particularly a lady who had recently lost her husband and whose daughters had gone to university. Mr Griffiths also described an encounter at night in mid-September 2015 in which he feared for his own safety. 53. Mr Griffiths is a supporter of the cull because of the problems his farm has experienced with bTB over some years, but did not see himself as a vocal 16Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 supporter. However he was the only farmer in his area to speak out publicly (through the media) in favour of the cull and about the harassment and intimidation. Ms Dale’s evidence 54. Anna Dale made the requests in three of the appeals. She made the requests in her private capacity. She is personally concerned about wildlife and nature. She became interested in badgers sometime ago and introduced a badger into a children’s book she wrote. In 2012 she became aware of the Government’s badger control policy. 55. Her requests were prompted by her wish to know specific and important facts about the culls in order to participate in and allow proper and open debate about the issues the cull gives rise to. It had nothing to do with refining maps in order to increase harassment and intimidation of participants in the cull. She wanted to check whether the culling criteria were being adhered to, particularly: a. that the risk to non-participating farmers (within and beyond the Control Area) from badger perturbation was not increasing; b. the adequacy of the buffers and barriers and other measures to mitigate the spread of bTB to areas outside the cull zones; c. the extent of local support (and whether culling was taking place on cattle farms or in areas without cattle); d. that the monitoring of the badger culls was being properly carried out. 56. In Ms Dale’s view, since making her requests it has become clear that the culling companies have departed from the culling criteria and that, having read the IEP’s report, the culls have not been effective or humane. Also she considers that the Government’s policy is no longer science-led. 17Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 57. Ms Dale is a member of the Badger Trust and has taken part in some marches. She organised one in Winchester. These were entirely peaceful. She considers that the degree of seriousness of the incidents referred to by Witnesses A and B does not tally with her experience and other public information. 58. Ray Puttock gave evidence in support of Ms Dale. He has trained as a vaccinator of badgers and believes vaccination provides an alternative route to reducing bTB. Mr Puttock lives in Gloucestershire and is involved in campaigning for badger protection. He is involved in running a telephone line coordinating badger patrols called Gloucester Badger Office. Since 2013 he has acted as police liaison representative for those opposed to badger culling in the Gloucester area. He goes out to the countryside with people on badger patrol and confirmed that contractors are not allowed to shoot badgers when people are present nearby, for reasons of public safety. He has meetings with local police nightly during the culling season to discuss and address any issues. In this way the anti-culling community seeks to work closely and co- operatively with the police in order to ensure that criminal activity does not take place and that the local rural community is not disrupted. Mr Puttock considers the campaign is now almost wholly unmarked by intimidation, harassment, violence or other unlawful activity, although given that feelings run high ‘on both sides’ there continues to be isolated cases of damage. His car was damaged a few days before he gave evidence (but the perpetrators are unknown). In his view well over 99% of campaigner activity and intervention takes place wholly peacefully. Both at an official policy level and on the ground those involved in organising the anti-culling campaign and nightly patrols are avowedly opposed to, and committed to avoiding, activity which involves harassment, intimidation, aggression, criminal damage and still less violence. He regards these types of activity as reprehensible and self- defeating to the anti-cull cause, which is to protect badgers from harm and to persuade farmers to withdraw from the cull. Those involved are very largely peaceful members of the local community who abhor and avoid all conduct of 18Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 the kind that would be harassing or illegal. 90% of the anti-cull protesters are women. 59. He accepts that in 2013 there were incidents of harassment but considers that the evidence given by the NE witnesses is exaggerated as to their severity and frequency. Also, the incidents were not in his view carried out by those centrally involved in the pro-badger movement. Where protesters were asked to avoid congregating near a particular house or using a particular footpath, these requests were followed. Although there were arrests following accusations of aggravated trespass he is not aware of any relating to intimidation or threats of violence and very few prosecutions let alone convictions have taken place, except Mr Tiernan who was not physically violent. He seems to consider that most incidents can be explained away as perfectly lawful activity, although he accepts what Mr Griffith and another farmer suffered was reprehensible. In any case he says the injunction seems to have served its purpose and there are now very few incidents. This is apparent from the number of arrests, which reduced markedly in 2014. 60. He points out that there have also been incidents of harassment and intimidation against, and damage to the property of, anti-cull protesters. 61. He believes the anti-cull movement can only achieve its aims if they get the public on its side, which means ‘winning the hearts and minds of local people’. One of the aims is to vaccinate badgers and cattle rather than shooting or trapping badgers as this would be, in his view, much more effective in eradicating bTB. 62. The local Badger Trust protesters operate in an area which they believe is 10 miles wider than the actual cull parameter because the perturbation area and the collection of evidence on the health of badgers through surveying setts is very important to them. Also he believes unlawful killing of badgers is taking place outside (but under the shadow of) the permitted cull zone. Therefore more precise identification of actual boundaries will not change the activities of anti-cull protesters in the Badger Trust because they choose to extend their 19Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 area of patrols beyond the Control Area. In any case Mr Puttock said they know the farmers who are participants in the cull because of their activities on the ground in observing both contractor movements and the location of traps. He points out that he is unaware of any protesters being discovered with stolen traps in their vehicles despite a number of vehicle searches by police. The timing of consideration of the exceptions 63. Under FOIA and EIR it has long been considered by the Information Tribunal and FTT that the public interest factors existing at the time of the public authority’s decision in relation to a request is the time when the public interest balance should be considered. If there is an internal review then that would be the relevant timeframe (or thereabouts) for considering public interest factors and the weight to be attributed to them. 64. This practice of the Tribunals has now been given authority by the Upper Tribunal in cases like APPGER v IC & FCO [2015] UKUT 0377 (ACC) at [55] and [56]. More recently the Supreme Court in R (on the application of Evans) and another v Attorney General [2015] UKSC 21 clarified that [72]: “It is common ground, in the light of the language of sections 50(1), 50(4) and 58(1), which all focus on the correctness of the original refusal by the public authority, that the Commissioner, and, on any appeal, any tribunal or court, have to assess the correctness of the public authority’s refusal to disclose as at the date of that refusal.” Here we take the Supreme Court to mean the date of the internal review which is when the final decision by the public authority to refuse to disclose the information is taken. 65. The Supreme Court went to find that [73] “However, although the question whether to uphold or overturn…. a refusal by a public authority must be determined as at the date of the original refusal, facts and matters and even grounds of exemption may, subject to the control of the Commissioner or the tribunal, be admissible even though they were not in the mind of the individual responsible for the 20Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 refusal or communicated at the time of the refusal to disclose (i) if they existed at the date of the refusal, or (ii) if they did not exist at that date, but only in so far as they throw light on the grounds now given for refusal.” (emphasis added) 66. None of the parties took issue with this position which is understandable in view of the Supreme Court’s judgment. The meaning of the public safety exception 67. The first exception claimed is regulation 12(5)(a): “(5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect – international relations, defence, national security or public safety; 68. What is the scope of the exception? 69. The first point of issue between the parties is the meaning of ‘public safety’. NE considers that it is sufficient to engage the exception if disclosure of the Withheld Information would increase the risk of harm to members of the public, and that “adverse effect on public safety” should not be restricted to actual harm or injury. It says the interest in question is safety, not health, i.e. ensuring that people are safe and free from a risk of injury. The Commissioner considers that this is too broad and that the question is whether disclosure would cause an actual adverse effect on the health of members of the public. NE contends that the Commissioner is ignoring the distinction between ‘public health’ and ‘public safety/security’. NE argues that, to be safe/secure, a person must not merely be free from injury but free from the risk of injury. This argument seems to have been developed because the evidence is not clear as to whether activities relating to the badger cull have led to actual physical or mental harm to anyone. What is clearer is that protester activity may well have caused ‘stress and worry’ to cull participants causing an adverse effect on their lives and a potential risk to personal health, safety or security. NE believes that disclosure of the Withheld Information would permit protesters to 21Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 refine their maps and to focus on the precise area of the cull zone, thus increasing the risk of ‘flashpoints’. 70. NE also relies on the reference to ‘security’ in the Directive - see §17 above. Parliament has chosen to implement the relevant Directive article in regulation 12(5)(a) by using the words ‘public safety’ and we must therefore assume that Parliament considered they had the same meaning. 71. Neither the EIR nor the Directive seek to distinguish between different categories of public safety/security. However, the Directive does make clear that the exceptions should be construed restrictively: Recital 16 and Ofcom, §12 above. Where the particular element of public safety/security relied upon is the adverse effect on individuals, the Commissioner argues that a fair reading of the exception requires an effect which is quantifiable and of some significance. The Directive places public security alongside international relations and national defence. On ordinary principles of construction, the concept of public security must be read in that context. It would be surprising, the Commissioner argues, if the causing of an unquantifiable level of worry or stress is to be considered equivalent to the imperilment of national security. 72. We agree with the Commissioner’s approach. As a point of departure if we were to accept that mere worry and stress or an increased risk of injury (which does not amount to an adverse effect on physical or mental health) automatically falls within the scope of the exception, then we would be applying a construction to the exception that is wider than (and contrary to) the intention reflected in the Directive and the restrictive approach taken by the CJEU in Ofcom. While public disclosure of information may cause stress, worry or an increased risk of injury, it must be of sufficient substance to constitute an adverse effect on public safety. Many disclosures may cause stress, worry or concern, justified or unjustified, to individuals linked to the information and may even increase a risk of harm. But that cannot be the litmus test, in our view, for the engagement of the exception. This approach is similar to that approved by the FTT in relation to the health and safety exemption under section 38(1) FOIA, where a similar distinction has been 22Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 drawn (also not derived from the pure text of the Act) to ensure that the exemption is kept within appropriate and proper bounds. 8 This does not prevent NE from relying on protester activity including campaigns of intimidation and harassment (or the risks they pose), only that it must demonstrate an adverse effect on public safety. This approach seems to us to strike an appropriate balance, which is particularly important in the context of lawful protesting which might nonetheless cause stress or worry. 73. We also do not consider it helpful or necessary to draw an artificial boundary between the concepts of actual harm and increased risk of harm or to determine, as an absolute test, whether an adverse effect to public safety may be caused only by the former and not by the latter. As mentioned, we agree with the Commissioner’s restrictive approach as a general principle but it will be a matter of fact and degree as to where the spectrum of harm (or risk of harm) lies, and whether it is sufficient to demonstrate an adverse effect on public safety. We also do not accept that NE’s isolated analogies and examples of increased risk of harm (none of which involve the public disclosure of information) would necessarily meet the public safety test. Again, any increased risk of harm (and whether it amounts to a threat to public safety) as a result of public disclosure of information would have to be assessed on the facts and circumstances of each case. 74. A good example is the Tribunal’s decision in Ofcom v IC & T-Mobile [EA/2006/0078], on which NE relies to support its view that an increased risk to personal health or well-being can engage the public safety exception. (Although this case was eventually referred to the CJEU and the Supreme Court, that was only to determine whether ‘aggregation’ of public interest across exceptions should be undertaken. The higher courts did not consider on appeal the Tribunal’s decision on whether regulation 12(5)(a) was engaged.) Although we are not bound by the Information Tribunal’s decision on this matter we consider it is worth exploring further. 8 For example see British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection v IC & Newcastle University EA/2010/0064. 23Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 75. The Ofcom decision involved a request for disclosure of information about the location, ownership and technical attributes of mobile phone cellular base stations. One of the exceptions relied upon for withholding the information was adverse effect on public safety. 76. A significant amount of information about base stations was already in the public domain (largely contained in a database), and mobile network operators were already suffering a degree of theft, vandalism and damage. Therefore a material feature of the case (and of the assessment of “adverse effect on public safety”) was the extent to which disclosure of the remaining information in the database would increase those risks to the extent that it would threaten public safety. It was, in essence, an incremental analysis on the evidence. And upon that analysis the Tribunal found (at [40]): “We accept that the release of the whole database would provide some assistance to criminals. We think that use of the database for criminal purposes is more likely to be for the purpose of either increasing the efficiency of a trawl of the most valuable sites in an area, or disrupting the public or police communication network in order to hamper the coordination of the authority's reaction to a particular crime. It is therefore more likely to occur at a relatively localised level with the information being obtained by interrogating the Sitefinder database through the relevant website maps. However, it is conceivable that data manipulation would enable sophisticated criminals to detect patterns of development in base station construction, which could assist their activities and we did receive some evidence suggesting that criminals working in this area are beginning to operate on a national basis. We believe that greater risks might result from the release of the five figure grid reference numbers. This would enable criminals to establish the precise location of, and (in an urban environment), the resulting ease of access to, base stations. However, the vulnerability of base stations in a populated area may be reduced by their location and, in some areas at least, the location may already be publicly available in the form of details published by local planning authorities of the current and proposed base stations in their area as part of the rollout plans mentioned in paragraph 9 above. Nevertheless the disclosure of the requested information will to some degree increase the risk of attacks and in that way may adversely affect public safety.” (The emphasised sentence is the one relied on by NE in this appeal.) 77. We do not read this to mean that the Tribunal considered that any degree of increased risk of any type of harm or injury would satisfy the test for adverse effect on public safety. Rather, on the facts of that case and based on the level and extent of harm already suffered and the degree of risk of further 24Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 harm, the Tribunal accepted that disclosure of the remaining information would have an adverse effect on public safety. It does not detract from the general principle that a restrictive approach should be taken to the engagement of the exception, and that the evidence must establish a real and substantial adverse effect on public safety – whether it is a direct, actual effect or an increased risk of harm. 78. Counsel for NE argued that the Commissioner’s approach will lead to ""drastic and terrifying results"", and that it ""could endanger people’s safety for no good reason"" and that it is ""a reckless and thoughtless construction."" We do not consider our approach can be described in this way. We do not exclude the possibility that, in an appropriate case, a real and sufficiently high degree of risk of substantial public harm could constitute an adverse effect on public safety. However, for the reasons set out further below, we do not believe that this is such a case. 79. All parties agree that public safety can include an adverse effect on property. However, Ms Dale argues a proportionality point, i.e. that this can only be the case where property damage is of a sufficiently serious kind to pose a threat to the health and well-being of members of the public. So, for example, damage to a farmer’s house whilst his family are in residence is likely to meet the public safety test but damage to badger traps would not. 80. NE argues that property damage must be covered by the public safety exception because that is the only way to give adequate and proportionate protection to individuals’ rights to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions under Article 1 Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“A1P1”). We did not receive lengthy submissions on this point and this may be because property damage is perhaps not the thrust of NE’s case in these appeals. The main evidence of damage to property directly attributable to anti- cull protesters relates to badger traps. Although there is no dispute that such activity is unlawful, we do not consider that property damage of this sort, which has no impact on the wider community, is what Parliament intended to be covered by public safety. 25Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 The test under the public safety exception 81. There is a significant difference between the EIR formulation of the exception in regulation 12(5) and analogous FOIA exemptions (such as the health and safety exemption in section 38(1) FOIA): FOIA uses “would or would be likely to”, while the EIR uses “would”. 82. Under FOIA the Information Tribunal and FTT have considered the test to be applied on many occasions. The “would” element has generally been considered to indicate a higher test than “would be likely to"". This has also been recognised when applying the “would adversely affect” test under EIR. For example in Archer v Information Commissioner [2011] 1 Info LR 1405 at [51] the Tribunal found “it is necessary to show that disclosure “would” have [the claimed adverse effect] – not that it could or might have such effect”. That Tribunal concluded that, when considered in combination with the presumption in favour of disclosure and the public interest test, the effect of this was that “the threshold to justify non-disclosure is a high one”. 83. That question is to be resolved on the balance of probabilities. Accordingly, “would” in practical terms means “more likely than not”. This is to be distinguished from the FOIA context, where the “would be likely to” test encompasses a “real and significant risk … even if it cannot be said that the occurrence … is more probable than not” (Hogan v Information Commissioner [2011] 1 Info LR 588 at [35]). 84. The Upper Tribunal has confirmed this approach in Department for Communities and Local Government v Information Commissioner & Robinson [2012] UKUT 103 (AAC); [2012] 2 Info LR 43 (when considering the exception of adverse effect on the course of justice in regulation 12(5)(b), in the context of legal privilege) at [54]: “it would of course have to be borne in mind, when considering the significance of an adverse effect on the course of justice in the particular case, that the exception is only engaged if the course of justice would be adversely affected. We agree with the decision in Maiden EA/2008/0013 26Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 that this means that, at the material time, the adverse effect must be more probable than not.” (original emphasis) 85. This domestic approach is entirely consistent with the Aarhus Implementation Guide (2nd ed.) at p.86, which provides that: “Adversely affect means that the disclosure would have a negative impact on the relevant interest. The use of the word “would” instead of “may” requires a greater degree of certainty that the request will have an adverse effect than applies in other provisions of the Convention”. 86. We return at this point to the Information Tribunal’s Ofcom decision and the passage quoted at paragraph 76 above, which potentially leaves room for doubt. 87. Before dealing with the exceptions on the facts, the Tribunal endorsed (at [34]) the general approach set out in the decision of Archer v the Information Commissioner and Salisbury DC (EA/2006/0037): “First, it is not enough that disclosure should simply affect the interest in question; the effect must be “adverse”. Second, refusal to disclose is only permitted to the extent of that adverse effect. Third, it is necessary to show that disclosure “would” have an adverse effect - not that it could or might have such effect.” (emphasis added) 88. And at [35] of the Ofcom decision the Tribunal continued: We also have in mind, in considering regulation 12, that we must apply the civil standard of proof; we must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relevant harm would be suffered. Finally, we must bear in mind that Article 4 of the Directive requires us to interpret grounds for refusal to disclose in a restrictive way.” 89. So far, so good. However, in its assessment of the evidence and of whether disclosure of the disputed information would adversely affect public safety, the Tribunal imparted the following (at [40]): ”Nevertheless the disclosure of the requested information will to some degree increase the risk of attacks and in that way may adversely affect public safety.” (emphasis added). 90. It may be that the use of the word “may” was an inadvertent slip because the Tribunal was analysing the degree of risk of harm and the potential effect of such harm. We do not interpret the Tribunal’s use of the word “may” in that context to mean that “would adversely affect” means something less than 27Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 “more likely than not”. To the extent that it does, and is therefore inconsistent with the established balance of probabilities approach as set out above, we are not bound by it. 91. We would add that, if the Directive had intended a broader “likely to” or “may” approach to be adopted, it would have said so expressly. So, for example, in Article 2(1)(b), environmental information is defined in terms which include “factors…affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment” (and see Article 2(1)(c) and recital 10, Article 7(2)(e) and Article 7(4) similarly). 92. We have already dealt with NE’s submissions about whether an increased risk of harm would adversely affect public safety. That point is also relevant to the balance of probabilities test, and we would add at this juncture that the “risk of harm” approach is more akin to those categories of exemptions under FOIA which require a prejudice that “would be likely” to happen. It is something which, by definition, cannot be said on the balance of probabilities will occur; rather that the risk of it occurring has increased from (say) 10% to (say) 30%. However, an adverse effect which would occur requires at least a 50% likelihood. A mere increase in risk of harm is not itself an adverse effect if it does not undermine public safety; the regime already applies an appropriate balance by recognising that a public authority is only required to demonstrate that an adverse effect on public safety is more likely than not (rather than certain or beyond reasonable doubt or some other standard). The approach involves risk only in the limited sense that any counterfactual exercise (what would eventuate if the information were disclosed) involves an assessment of probabilities. 93. NE also rely upon the recent decision of this Tribunal in Natural England v ICO & Badger Trust & Leston (EA/2015/0026) at [24], where it was held that the Commissioner’s conclusion – that disclosure of confidential financial information would not cause significant harm and so the regulation 12(5)(d) and (e) exemptions were not engaged – disregarded “the fundamental requirement to recognise other values” and there was “no requirement to demonstrate any harm beyond the harm of breaching the principal [sic]”. We 28Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 agree with the Commissioner in this case that it is not at all clear what [24] means. Whilst we fully accept the exceptions are a part of the statutory structure of the EIR that does not alter the express statutory and jurisprudential guidance that there is a general principle of disclosure and exceptions to that principle that must be construed restrictively. 94. The IC and Ms Dale have argued that the effect of disclosing each piece of information should be considered separately, rather than in aggregate. NE contends that this is wrong and contrary to binding authority. In FCO v ICO & Plowden [2013] UKUT 0275 (AAC) at [16] the Upper Tribunal found that the FTT had erred by taking the approach advocated by the ICO: “16. I also consider that the tribunal failed to take account of the information as a package.” 95. We are bound by the decision in Plowden. However we are dealing with two separate appeals which although being considered together have not been consolidated. We are also not sure that Plowden extends to the circumstances in these appeals because Plowden involved two parts of a conversation, rather than separate pieces of information. In any event, we accept that the Withheld Information in both requests relates to one subject and should be considered together. Is the public safety exception engaged? 96. There has been extensive evidence in this case referred to above. We would summarise it as follows. a. Badger culling is a very controversial subject and there are strong views on both sides of the matter; b. In 2013, possibly going back to 2012, leading up to the start of the pilot culls, there is evidence of incidents of protester activity against the cull; c. NE witnesses tend to describe this activity in terms of harassing and intimidating behaviour. They particularly provide details of two farmers who were subject to multiple incidents; 29Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 d. This led to the NFU applying for and obtaining an injunction in August 2013 which still applies and has the effect of making many activities of protest (which would otherwise be permissible) unlawful; e. The protesters accept that there were many incidents but as far as they are concerned they were very largely lawful forms of protest that are permitted in a democratic and open society; f. The mainstream anti-cull movement like the pro-cull movement deplore illegal activity and any harassment or intimidation of farmers; g. However there has been some unacceptable behaviour but this involves a small number of activists. This sort of behaviour has largely ceased since the injunction has been in place; h. Although there were some arrests in 2013 there have been very few since and almost no prosecutions throughout the cull; i. There is evidence of damage to and removal of traps but these relate to a very small percentage of traps being set by contractors and such incidents have been reducing; j. Since the injunction there has been one conviction and that did not involve acts of violence. 97. We are required to determine whether disclosure of the limited amount of information still in dispute would adversely affect public safety according to the applicable law set out above. We are particularly mindful of the relevant timeframe to be considered for engagement of the exception. In relation to the relevant requests the internal review letters were dated 19 July 2013 and 19 August 2013. It has been agreed by all parties that we should consider the cases together so it makes sense that we should be considering the application of the exceptions as at the summer of 2013. We shall refer to this period as the ‘applicable time’. 98. We would note that the summarised evidence in §96 above, relating to the evidence provided by the witnesses, was often provided in vague terms as to dates and timeframes. 30Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 99. NE argues that if the information is disclosed it will enable protesters to refine their maps of the cull areas so they can target more accurately the participants in the cull and this would lead to a risk of further and/or increased harassment and intimidation of farmers. 100. The evidence before us shows that the protesters have continually been refining their maps from published material, the ‘drip-drip’ of disclosures by NE and Defra, and their work on the ground to identify the areas more clearly. We can see this from the protester maps shown in evidence in June and then November 2013. Although the latter date is later than the applicable time we can assume this was a continuous process. There is no evidence that the Withheld Information itself would have enabled the protesters to discover the exact boundaries but the evidence before us shows it would have helped at the time, together with other information in the public domain or collected on the ground, to further refine their maps. 101. Does this mean that the refining of maps would adversely affect public safety? Firstly it is not clear whether map refinement would have reduced or increased protester activity. The evidence is that protesters patrol beyond the cull areas, and it can also be assumed that any inaccuracy of protester maps (particularly if they are larger than the actual cull areas) could lead to greater activity. Most of the incidents described seem to us to be perfectly lawful protester activity, such as marching or demonstrating to gain public support for their cause; or identifying participants who can be lobbied and using largely lawful methods to try to persuade them to cease involvement in the culls through social media, phone calls, writing polite letters to retailers of farm produce etc. 102. We believe we can take the injunction into account because at the applicable time the injunction was about to be or had been granted (August 2013). In any case proceedings leading up to the injunction had taken place before this, and the proceedings must have been a factor relevant to the internal reviews undertaken by NE. Even if it was not, the injunction was in 31Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 place and should have been taken into account, particularly in relation to the likely effects of disclosure. As we know from the evidence, the injunction has been largely effective in preventing harassment and unlawful activity. 103. The NE claims there was an increasing risk that any further disclosure at the applicable time would have led to further incidents including harassment and intimidation. While this may be correct, we do not consider that such increased risk constituted an adverse effect on public safety. 104. Even on NE’s own, more generous test, the evidence is speculative. The Tribunal does not doubt that some farmers have been subjected to protests, and that the conduct of some protesters has crossed the line of unlawful conduct (civil or criminal). However, the limited police figures and correspondence available in evidence (and no separate figures are provided by NE) do not support widespread chaos and illegality across the the WG and WS cull areas: Avon & Somerset Police made eight arrests in 2013 (two of which were de-arrested), and received 108 complaints in 2014 (including 13 by protesters), while Gloucestershire Police made 38 arrests in 2013 and 2 in 2014, with 30 recorded crimes in 2014. Very few arrests led to prosecutions. The High Court injunction granted to the NFU appears to have very largely worked. 105. We are required to consider whether, on a balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that disclosure of the Withheld Information at the applicable time would have adversely affected public safety (either directly or, as NE submits, as a result of increased risk of harm). On the evidence before us we cannot make that finding. In our view, on the balance of probabilities, the disclosure of the Withheld information would not have caused direct or actual harm to public safety or increased the risk of harm to a degree or extent that it could be said to adversely affect public safety. We make this finding for each of the appeals which are still in dispute. 106. We therefore find the exception is not engaged for both appeals. 32Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 Is the protection of the environment exception engaged? 107. We need to consider whether disclosure of the Withheld Information, again at the applicable time, would have adversely affected the protection of the environment to which the information relates. 108. NE argues that if the information is disclosed it could enable and motivate the protesters to lobby or intimidate cull participants, in order to persuade them to withdraw from the cull thereby reducing the area below the 70% threshold resulting in the possibility of the pilots being stopped (as the Licence condition is no longer met). If the culling has to stop until new participants are identified and a new Licence is granted, the robust data anticipated from a sustained minimum four year cull would be lost. This in turn would adversely affect the aim of eradicating or reducing bTB in cattle to the detriment of the environment. 109. Despite all the protester activity leading up to the start of the cull in September 2013 it was not stopped. Any consideration as to whether or not it should be stopped is likely to have taken place before or during the applicable time. 110. It is fair to say that NE does not place nearly the same emphasis or reliance on this exception as they do on the public safety exception. 111. The evidence before us shows that no participants in the cull areas withdrew before the start of the cull in September 2013 or have withdrawn since then, despite the intimidation and harassment alleged by the NE witnesses. Even Mr Griffiths, who seems to have suffered much more than most of the participants, has not been deterred in his determination to take part in the cull in WG. 33Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 112. Although there may be a risk that participants may withdraw in the future if harassed or intimidated, as we have already found there is little evidence of unlawful activity and what evidence there is mainly took place in the lead up to the first cull in September 2013. In any case it has now been disclosed that WS was well above the 70% threshold so it is very unlikely that disclosure of the Withheld Information would have had an adverse effect in this area. Government policy does not seem to mandate that the threshold be achieved, whatever was believed by NE, protesters and participants. Also it is interesting to note that the Government is currently consulting on the threshold level, among other things. Therefore there is no certainty that if the threshold levels had been breached the cull would have been stopped, particularly because of the history of badger culling trials where even though their effectiveness has been questioned the Government has continued to pursue them. 113. There is also a counter argument that protecting badgers also protects the environment. Badgers are a protected species in England. The anti-cull movement believe that vaccinating badgers and other measures such as restricting cattle movements are the way to protect the environment including cattle. These views, we are informed, are supported by many scientists. 114. We find on a balance of probabilities that disclosure of the Withheld Information would not, at the applicable time, have adversely affected the protection of the environment in the pilot areas. In other words we cannot find that it would be more probable than not that, at the applicable time, disclosure would have led to the culls being aborted or in any way held up to the detriment of the environment. Therefore we find that the exception is not engaged in both appeals. The public interest test 115. If we are wrong in our determination that neither (or either) of the exceptions are engaged, we must consider the public interest balance. 34Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 116. The Tribunal needs to consider the public interest factors in favour of maintaining the exception/s and those favouring disclosure in order to determine the public interest balance. We also need to consider what weight to give to the various factors in order to help us with the exercise. 117. NE correctly points out that we are required to assess each side of the public interest balance on a ‘contents basis’ (see Department of Health v IC and Lewis [2015] UKUT 0159 (AAC) at [33]). That means that the public interest must be assessed on the basis of what effect disclosure of this particular information would have. The fact that the badger culls are a matter of significant public interest does not mean that there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of every piece of information in relation to the badger culls. It is necessary to identify how disclosure of the Withheld Information will inform public debate. 118. As to the public interest in disclosing this information, there are two related classes of public interest issues: the general and the specific. Generally, there is a strong public interest, inherent in the EIRs, in the creation of a sustainable environment, in transparency and accountability, and in the facilitation of public participation and public debate on matters of environmental concern. These include the use of the disclosed information, together with information already made public, to “enable [the public] to challenge decisions”: Creekside Forum v Information Commissioner (EA/2008/0065) at [39]. The clear link between public access to information, public action, and the desired result of a sustainable environment is set out in recital 1 to the Directive. In Home Office & Ministry of Justice v ICO [2009] EWHC 1611 (Admin) at [34] Keith J said: “I do not see why in principle a “generalised” factor should be of less significance than a more specific one.” 119. Further, the whole basis of Aarhus and the Directive is to encourage public participation in environmental matters. That participation encompasses, as a central feature, public protest on matters of environmental concern. Where, as here, Government policy on an environmental issue is a matter of substantial 35Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 debate and concern, the provision of environmental information, including information facilitating protest, is vitally important. Increased protesting in the cull areas (or better directed protesting) is perfectly legitimate in a democratic society. We must guard against impermissibly mingling criticism of unlawful activity with criticism of legitimate protest. 120. Furthermore, the scheme of the EIR and the Directive recognises that it can sometimes be in the public interest to disclose information even though public safety would be adversely affected. Given that in many cases things which adversely affect public safety are unlawful (in civil or criminal law), Parliament must have been taken to be providing that it is not necessarily the case that every unlawful activity must be avoided. This point was made expressly by the Court of Appeal in R (Ofcom) v Information Commissioner [2009] EWCA Civ 90 at [54]-[59]. Doubtless the balance must be affected by the certainty with which the evidence establishes the adverse effect, and the severity of that effect. There is, for example, no necessary need to treat an adverse effect on property (such as a badger trap) as having the same weight as an adverse effect on safety from a physical attack on a person or an inhabited dwelling. 121. We accept that the public interest must be considered by reference to the specific Withheld Information. It is right that not every piece of information relating to the badger cull should be released simply because the Policy is controversial. However, that controversy, combined with the regulation 12(2) presumption in favour of disclosure, does importantly set the context for the balancing exercise. 122. NE considers that the risk of people suffering the kinds of things Mr Griffiths has suffered far exceeds any public interest in disclosure. 123. There is a very strong public interest in helping to prevent threats to and harassment of participating farmers. However the evidence in this case is that Mr Griffith’s experience was not experienced by more than a small number of farmers after the injunction was in place, and that the vast majority of 36Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 protester activity was peaceful and lawful. Moreover, the granting of the injunction provided a high degree of protection, which has been seen in practice. These factors go some way to diminishing the strength of this public interest. 124. The Commissioner and Ms Dale consider there is weighty specific public interest in support of disclosure. 125. The Commissioner argues that one of the critical objections to culling in the RBCT was that it actually increased the incidents of bTB in the surrounding area of the cull zone. The Government sought to deal with that problem, whilst still implementing a cull, by recognising the need to bound the cull zones with a mixture of buffers and barriers, such as hard boundaries like motorways or water, combined with soft boundaries in areas where badgers are vaccinated or other control measures taken. This can be seen from the Impact Assessment, 30 November 2011, internal p.5. Release of BCP information which provides the length of the kinds of boundaries and buffers will enable the public to engage in an informed debate as to the success of that safeguard. Similarly, the perturbation effect will be harder to discover or analyse without the length of the perimeter of the pilot areas. It is also hard to understand why this is withheld when the area figure has been given. 126. NE disagrees and suggests that the Withheld Information cannot add much to the public debate particularly as the information already disclosed by the time of the hearing clearly indicates that there is no information held on the nature of barriers or buffers in WG. Ms Dale disagrees, and the fact that she now knows there are no barriers and buffers recorded in the BCP for WG is ‘significant in itself’ (a legitimate cause for concern in assessing the cull). 127. Given Defra’s inadvertent release of the area figures for WS and WG, welcomed by Ms Dale, it is slightly surprising that it is maintained by NE that there would be no public interest in the release of the area figures for the surrounding rings. It would appear to be relevant to assess the effectiveness of anti-perturbation measures to know the area of land deemed to be 37Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 potentially affected, as well as understanding the way in which NE and Defra are carrying out their assessment functions. 128. The ability to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the pilot culls is a significant public interest particularly in view of the public controversy surrounding the badger culls. The IEP was not set up on a continuing basis and had a particular brief. In any case the IEP’s report is not a reason why Ms Dale or any other member of the public should not be able to use the Withheld Information to help them test the adequacy of barriers, buffers and other measures to mitigate the risk of perturbation and the cost effectiveness of the Policy. 129. We note that NE is now performing the monitoring function without there being any IEP assessment and as a body implementing Government policy NE will not be perceived by the public to be entirely objective. In view of the IEP’s limited brief it could have been anticipated at the applicable time that the Government would not necessarily have renewed its appointment. 130. The fact that the Government is now, as might always have been expected, carrying out a consultation on aspects of the Policy supports the need for respondees to that consultation to have access to as much information as possible so as to provide informed responses. 131. The other principal public interest in protecting the environment advanced by NE (regulation 12(5)(g)) is that disclosure could lead to the stopping of the cull which would adversely affect the testing of the effectiveness of badger culling on the reduction of bTB in cattle. 132. There is no evidence in this case that, despite the incidents leading up to the August/September 2013 cull, any participants withdrew their participation. There is no reason to believe that disclosure of the Withheld Information would make any difference. We note that there have been many disclosures since the applicable time and still no participants have withdrawn their participation in the pilot culls. 38Case Numbers EA/2014/0094, 0160, 0234 & 0311 133. Therefore we do not place much weight on this public interest factor. 134. Under regulation 12(1) EIR the public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if – “(b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 135. We take heed of the fact that we are required to aggregate the public interest in favour of maintaining the exceptions. 136. We have considered the public interest balancing exercise and also the presumption in favour of disclosure and find that in all the circumstances of these appeals the public interest in maintaining the exceptions does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure for the reasons given above. In summary we find that in the circumstances of this case the weight we give to the ability of protesters to be able to more effectively monitor the effectiveness of a controversial Government policy is greater than the weight we give to the combined increasing risk of harm to farmers and the stopping of the culls. Conclusion 137. We dismiss the appeals in cases EA /2014/0094 and 0160 and order that the Withheld Information is disclosed within 30 days of the date of this decision.

For the Respondent: Ms Elizabeth Kelsey, Counsel instructed by the Information Commissioner. -1-Subject matter: FOIA 2000 Absolute Exemptions Information accessible by other means s.21 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 21 April 2015 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Mr David Lamb (the Appellant) wanted to know information about Liverpool City Council’s parking policy. 2. On 14 November 2014 he asked – as part of a larger request – about the following: (1) The City Council’s policy on which vehicles may park in ‘residents’ only’ parking bays in the Outer Controlled Parking Zone (OCPZ) zone K, specifically in relation to (a) pay-and-display ticket holders, (b) motorcycles, (c) disability ‘blue badge’ holders and (d) social housing landlords contractors. (2) If there has been any change in policy since the City Council leaflet “Parking in the Outer Controlled Parking Zone” was issued in 2005 please provide (a) the minutes of (or the link to) the City Council meeting at which the change was approved and (b) the title of the central government legislation or guidance that brought about the change or changes. 3. The Council responded on 12 December 2014 disclosing some of the information and relying on the fact that the remainder of the information was already publicly available, and therefore exempt under section 21 (1) FOIA. It completed an internal review on 6 January 2015 and maintained its position. The complaint to the Information Commissioner -2-4. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 8 February 2015, contesting the Council’s response to his information request as detailed above. 5. The Commissioner upheld Liverpool City Council’s response and found, after investigation, that it had correctly applied the provisions of s.21 (1) FOIA to the Appellant’s request. The appeal to the Tribunal 6. In his appeal to the Tribunal the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal made the following points (in summary): (1) It was not reasonable for the Commissioner to support the proposition that the City Council did not hold the record of who made – and when they made and why they made – a decision to change the policy on the lawful enforcement of its parking policy. (2) It was not logical or acceptable to argue that information was published and available by other means while at the same time stating that the information was not published and was not available. (3) Any decision made by the City Council to change its policy on lawful enforcement of parking regulations should have been made or approved by elected councillors at a minuted meeting. It was unacceptable and possibly unlawful for an undocumented change of parking enforcement policy to be made “behind closed doors” by Council officials. (4) The information that he was requesting in (2) of his request must be held by the Council. That was because the Council’s position in relation to (1) of his request was that it would be “formally recorded” shortly. (5) The decision to allow disability badge holders to park in residents’ only parking bays had been taken 18 months or more ago but the published parking policy document had not yet been amended to include it. As a result, holders of disability badges were parking in residents’ parking spaces – suggesting they had been informed by the City Council that they could do so – but residents had never been informed of the change or when or how it came about. Conclusion and remedy 7. The Tribunal can understand the Appellant’s perplexity. He believes that the Council should hold this information. -3-8. The reality is that, with the benefit of the Commissioner’s review of the situation, it is clear that the Council does not – as a matter of fact - hold the information. 9. The Council has explained that its current policy is, indeed, to allow disabled badge holders to park within residents’ bays but that this concession is not yet set out in its policy documents although it intends to make the amendment as soon as possible. 10. To the extent that its published policy is available then that is covered, correctly, by section 21 (1) FOIA. It has not yet been updated and, because that is the case, the Council cannot provide to the Appellant any further information. 11. The Council stated to the Commissioner that it held no information in relation to (2) of the Appellant’s request. The expectation by the Appellant that the Council might hold some record of this change is not unreasonable. 12. Nonetheless, that is not the case in this instance. That is a matter for the Council. 13. This Tribunal is only concerned about whether the information exists in a form that can be supplied to the Appellant because it is held by the Council. 14. It finds, on the balance of probabilities, that it is not held by the Council. 15. For these reasons the Appellant’s appeal is dismissed. 16. Our decision is unanimous. 17. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 30 October 2015 -4-"
"49","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50548705 Dated: 17 December 2014 Appellant: Brian Egan Respondent: The Information Commissioner Heard at: Guildford Date of Hearing: 29 June 2015, deliberations 28 August 2015 Before Chris Hughes Judge and Anne Chafer and Paul Taylor Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 8 September 2015Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 Attendances: For the Appellant: in person For the Respondent: did not attend Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 17 December 2014 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in these proceedings (“Mr Egan”) has a concern about how planning issues related to his property have been handled by his local authority, Waverley Borough Council (“the Council”). There were complaints by neighbours in 2009 and 2013. The earlier complaint resulted in enforcement action being started and withdrawn by the local authority against Mr Egan. He subsequently appealed a refusal of planning permission and there were also judicial review proceedings. 2. On 19 June 2014 Mr Egan wrote to the Council seeking information about the planning complaints and how they had been handled:- “1.IN CONNECTION WITH PAUL HARDWICK AND DARRAN EGGLETON’S VISIT TO (44 address redacted) ON 12/08/09 a. Letter of complaint from (name redacted X) of (address redacted) (or note of telephone conversation). b. Officers report on visit on 12/08/09 from both Paul Hardwick and Darran Eggleton 2Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 c. Statements made by Paul Hardwick and Darran Eggleton to the in house solicitors dept. re the Temporary Stop Notice and Judicial Review d. Any other relevant information in connection with the complaint or conclusion. 2. IN CONNECTION WITH RYAN SNOW AND VICTORIA CHOULARTON’S VISIT TO (address redacted) ON OR ABOUT 02/07/13 a. Letter of complaint from (name redacted Y) of (address redacted)(or note of telephone conversation) b. Officers report on visit on or about 02/07/13 from both Ryan Snow and Victoria Choularton c. Any other relevant information in connection with the complaint or conclusion.” 3. The Council responded on 22 July 2014. With respect to each complaint it confirmed that it held notes of the original telephone call which it was not prepared to disclose relying on section 41 of FOIA – information provided in confidence. It provided the officers’ reports for each visit, confirmed that it held no other information in connection with the complaints and confirmed that in respect of the earlier complaint it did not hold such statements made by the officers to the Council’s lawyers. 4. Mr Egan complained to the ICO on 18 July 2014 and was advised to seek a review by the Council. By a letter of 29 July 2014 he sought an internal review of the decision stating:- You have ignored my request for copies of the written complaint from (name redacted X) of (address redacted) and the later complaint by (name redacted Y) of (address redacted). I do consider this information necessary in order to be able to prove members of your organisation have lied in order to cover up the heavy handed way in which an Enforcement Notice was issued. 5. Following the internal review, to which it replied on the 27 August 2014, the Council found two further photographs taken on the first site visit and upheld its original decision with respect to withholding the complaints under section 41 explaining its reasoning:- In this case there is an implied duty of confidence in respect of this information, and this arises from the fact that the Council operates a long established practice that 3Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 complaints made to the Council’s Planning service are to be treated confidentially in order to protect the identity of complainants, and in order to ensure that prospective complainants are not discouraged from making complaints by virtue of the fact that their details might be provided to other third parties. In my view this establishes an implied duty of confidence which would be actionable by those third parties should the Council breach that duty of confidence through disclosure of the information. I am also satisfied that the public interest in maintaining the exemption under section 41 outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. The Information Commissioner has established that there is a strong public interest in favour of maintaining the confidentiality of information provided in confidence, and there is no general public interest in disclosing confidential information in breach of a duty of confidence. While there is a public interest in ensuring the public scrutiny of the activities of public authorities, this will not in itself override the public interest in maintaining confidentiality where the interests of a private person or persons protected by the duty of confidence (as is the case in this matter)… I have also concluded that disclosure of the information would restrict the effective administration of the Planning service by dis-encouraging the general public to submit concerns regarding Planning-related matters. 6. On 9 September 2014 Mr Egan wrote again to the Council seeking further information relating to his disputes with the Council and complaints that he had made to the Council. There has been extensive subsequent correspondence raising a number of issues; however the request with which the tribunal is concerned is the request of 19 June 2014, which was considered by the Respondent to this appeal, the Information Commissioner (“the ICO”) in his decision notice. 7. Mr Egan subsequently accused the Council of withholding information and complained that the Council on 25 November had decided to treat him as vexatious. The ICO investigating this complaint, dealt with it as the Council had, on the basis of whether section 41 applied. He also explained that while Mr Egan had raised many concerns relating to planning and the Council’s complaints procedures, the ICO could only deal with matters relating to FOIA. 8. In his decision notice the ICO considered the question of the application of section 41 in the light of the law relating to confidentiality. He concluded that the information 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 was from a third party, it had the necessary quality of confidence, was imparted in circumstances imparting a duty of confidence and that the public interest in maintaining the confidence outweighed any interest in disclosure. He upheld the Council’s decision to withhold the information. 9. In his notice of appeal (7 and 25 January) Mr Egan criticised the Council for sending him some information that he already had, raised issues with respect to the Council’s complaints policy and delays in the Council providing it to him, he further argued that both of his neighbours who had complained had told him about the complaints and therefore the information was not provided in confidence. He also stated (bundle page 20) “Although I cannot prove it the Council has withheld documents other than those allowable under s41.” 10. The ICO resisted the appeal. He maintained that the telephone notes were confidential and drew a distinction between what Mr Egan knew (which had not been told him by the Council) and the dissemination of the information to the world at large under FOIA. He noted that issues around the complaints policy were not within the scope of the request of 19 June and therefore not a matter for this appeal. Mr Egan’s arguments with respect to destruction or suppression of documents also related to a later request. 11. The ICO in the light of the considerable number of documents which the Council had, at various times, supplied to Mr Egan, said subsequently that the withheld information lacked the quality of confidence and sent it to Mr Egan shortly before the hearing on 22 June 2015 (subject to minor redactions related to the identity of persons). He continued to maintain that there was no further information within scope of the request beyond the initial telephone notes of the planning complaints and letters to the complainants. 12. At the hearing Mr Egan maintained his belief that the Council was withholding information and the tribunal gave him further time to formulate and submit his arguments which he did in a series of documents at the end of July. 13. In considering these submissions the tribunal reminded itself that the issue for the tribunal was whether the decision notice of the ICO was correct in law or whether, in the light of further evidence, it should determine that further information within the scope of 19 June request, was held. 5Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 14. The arguments were set out in a 9 point document entitled “Schedule of specific documents requested from WBC derived from those already sent on 22nd July, a review requested on 29th July and review answers on 27th August”. 15. Points 1 and 2 of this document relate to Mr Egan’s requests for the statements made by the planning officers in 2009 to the Council’s Legal Department. In support of his assertion that these documents exist he pointed to an e-mail chain (bundle pages 431/2) of 19 June 2014. The start of this chain is an email to all staff from a Director of the Council stating that Mr Egan is to be treated as vexatious. It contains a direction to staff:- “Staff should not engage with him in conversation if he phones you, but advise him that he should write to the Executive Director with any matters he wishes to raise with the Council.” 16. A recipient of the email communicated with her manager on the same day:- “Mrs Egan called me yesterday to ask for a copy of the Authorisation for serving the Temporary Stop Notice. I said that I would call her back this morning. Matthew has asked me not to call her back until we have the Authorisation to hand and that he is happy with it. If she calls me again this morning should I say she needs to contact Paul [the Executive Director] to request a copy? 17. Mr Egan asserts that this is proof that such an authorisation exists and is the same as the copies of statements from Paul Hardwick and /or Darran Eggleton he requested in his 19 June FOIA request –“I suspect that Eggleton or Hardwick’s request for this authorisation contains incriminating evidence and definitely exists”. 18. The tribunal is unable to accept this inference. The third part of the request of 19 June was for statements i.e. evidence, the document referred to is an authorisation – an instruction from the planning department to the legal department asking them to take action. The author of the email does not at that stage have any authorisation in front of her; she is seeking instructions about how to deal with a telephone call. In the Council’s reply to Mr Egan of 22 July 2014 (bundle pages 79-80) the Council confirmed with respect to the third part of the request relating to 2009 that:- “We are unable to locate any statements made to the in house solicitors by Paul Hardwick and Darren Eagleton.” 6Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 With respect to the fourth part of that request:- “Any other relevant information in connection with the complaint or conclusion. – All details WBC holds are included in attachment WAV00913”. The Tribunal is satisfied that the email (paragraph 16 above) is email is not evidence of the existence of any further information which was not disclosed in response to the request. 19. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the document amount to criticism of the Council and its officers and do not go to whether further information exists. 20. It is important to focus on the request of 19 June, although Mr Egan in his arguments has consistently sought to expand the interpretation of that request. The request relates to the planning complaints made about M Egan’s activities on his property and how the Council handled those complaints; as the request states “relevant information … in connection with the complaint or conclusion”. The conclusion of the complaint is the action that the Council took or did not take with respect to an alleged breach of planning control. It does not relate to Mr Egan’s subsequent complaints to the Council about its decision- making. That is a separate matter falling outside the scope of the 19 June request. 21. Paragraph 5 relates to a further request for information from Mr Egan dated 7 August. This expanded the scope of his request of 19 June and which, although headed with a reference related to the 19 June 2014 FOIA request, is from its contents clearly a new request for information relating to complaints which Mr Egan has made about the Council. 22. Paragraph 6 relates to the consideration of Mr Egan’s complaint by the acting CEO of the Council. Paragraph 6a criticises the Council for its email retention policy. Paragraph 6b criticises the Council for how it handled a complaint by Mr Egan. Paragraph 6c relates to a request for details of one of Mr Egan’s planning applications. Paragraph 6d related to the Council’s decision-making in connection with seeking costs against Mr Egan. Paragraph 6e related to the details of Mr Egan’s planning application’s and the desirability or otherwise of the imposition of planning conditions. 7Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 23. Paragraph 7 related to the notes of two reviews of complaints made by Mr. Egan. The history of Mr Egan’s complaints about the Council are not within the scope of 19 June request. 24. Paragraph 8 criticises the conduct of a Council officer. Paragraph 9 makes criticisms of the Council in the light of the contents of the material disclosed to Mr Egan by the ICO on 22 June 2015. 25. Mr Egan’s submissions therefore throw no light on whether the Council holds more material within the scope of the request. He has advanced no sustainable grounds for challenging the decision of the ICO that no further information, beyond the initially withheld material which was sent to Mr Egan on 22 June, exists. The tribunal is satisfied that Mr Egan has not discharged the burden of proof and it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that no further information is held. 26. The tribunal further noted that the difficulty which both the Council and the ICO appeared to have in resolving questions relating to the two information governance regimes for which the ICO is responsible – DPA and FOIA. The tribunal noted the change of position by the ICO and agreed that for the practical purposes of relations between Mr Egan and the Council, the information contained in the originally withheld material had already been disclosed to him. However the basis of that disclosure and whether such disclosures had been made to the world at large rather than to a single individual was unclear. The tribunal therefore concluded that in dismissing the appeal (which was contested on the basis that further information was held) it was inappropriate to substitute a decision notice addressing the question of whether in the circumstances of the case section 41 no longer applied. The issue raised by the handling of this case by the Council and the ICO is the practical handling of the interaction between FOIA and DPA. What has been disclosed to an individual, i.e. outside of FOIA, is irrelevant; such matters are not determinative in relation to disclosures to the world at large. FOIA is applicant blind, therefore it is inappropriate to take into account what an individual might know, or claims to know unless this can be demonstrated to have been made public in some way. By ""public"" it is important to distinguish between private conversation and published facts. Furthermore a requestor's personal data should not be disclosed in a response to him specifically because disclosure under FOIA is to the world at large. Instead consideration should be given to section 40(1) which applies in cases where 8Appeal No: EA/2015/0012 the requestor is the data subject. Provision of such information is then handled under the ""Subject Access Provisions"" in section 7, DPA98. There appears to be an approach with respect to the handling of personal data in this case (for example address, telephone number etc.) by both the Council and the Commissioner, apparently viewing such disclosures as minimal and not significant. If this approach is taken then care must be taken to ensure that other matters, for example sensitive personal data, are not similarly formally put into the public domain simply because the individual making a FOIA request would as the data subject, if he made a subject access request, have subject access rights to the information. The public disclosure of such sensitive data would be a significant breach of the DPA. Conclusion and remedy 27. For the reasons stated above this appeal is dismissed. 28.

Panel Judge Taylor, D Sivers, P De Waal Decision The appeal is dismissed for reasons set out below. Decision Promulgated: 21 July 2015 1Reasons Background 1. London Councils represents London’s 32 borough councils and the City of London, working on behalf of them regardless of political persuasion. 2. Parking on Private Land Appeals (“POPLA”) service is an independent adjudication service handling disputes by those wanting to challenge parking charge notices for vehicles parked on private land. It was created as a result of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Schedule 4 of this Act requires that there is an independent adjudication or arbitration service for disputes concerning such charges. 3. The British Parking Association (“BPA”) is a trade association. It is funded by the parking industry. It set up the POPLA service to fulfil the statutory requirements. London Councils currently provides the POPLA service on BPA’s behalf pursuant to a contract between BPA and London Councils. 4. This appeal concerns a request made by the Appellant to London Councils and POPLA, concerning appeals handled by the POPLA service. The Request 5. On 13 August 2014, the Appellant wrote to both London Councils and POPLA, requesting information. The part of the request that is relevant to this appeal (referred to below as the ‘request’) was as follows: “Please provide all records:- 1) showing how many appeals ParkingEye has won and lost in calendar year 2014 to date and include the appeal reference number(s) and car park location....” 6. On 9 September 2014, London Councils stated that it did not hold any information within the request scope for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), because the information regarding the delivery and operation of POPLA was held by London Councils confidentially on behalf of BPA. 7. On 9 September 2014 the Appellant wrote to London Councils, asking whether POPLA would also respond to his request. London Councils replied on 10 September 2014, stating that their response was on behalf of POPLA and that POPLA was not a public body for the purposes of FOIA. 8. The Appellant progressed with his request, and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) investigated the matter. Its Decision Notice of 8 December 2014 concluded that London Councils held the information on behalf of ‘another person’. 9. The Appellant appeals to this Tribunal contesting the finding that the public authority does not hold the requested information except for and on behalf of another. 2The Law 10. Generally, public authorities are under a duty under FOIA to disclose requested information that they hold at the time of the request unless certain provisions within the FOIA apply. (See section 1 FOIA). 11. For our purpose in this appeal, for a request to be successful it needs to be made to a body that is a ‘public authority’ that ‘holds’ the information within the meaning of the FOIA. 12. A public authority is: ‘(1)… (a) subject to section 4(4)... (i) is listed in Schedule 1, or (ii) is designated by order under section 5, or (b) a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6.’ See S.3 (1) FOIA 13. Information is ‘held’ by a public authority when ‘(a) it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person, or (b) it is held by another person on behalf of the authority See S.3(2) FOIA (Emphasis Added). 14. In essence, the question of whether London Council ‘holds’ the information is one of fact to be determined by the evidence. However, we have regard to the Upper Tribunal decision in Newcastle upon Tyne v Information Commissioner and British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection [2011] UKUT 185 (AAC) (‘BUAV’) finding that the word ‘held’ has its ordinary meaning: “The test that FOIA uses is whether the public authority “holds” the requested information. The test is not whether the public authority “controls” or “possesses” or “owns” the information in question; simply whether it “holds” it… “Hold”... is an ordinary English word and is not used in some technical sense in the Act… the [First-tier] tribunal ruled that “‘holding’ is not a purely physical concept” ... I do not regard the tribunal’s reference to the need for “an appropriate connection between the information and the authority” as a misguided attempt to replace the statutory language with its own “rather nebulous” test ... On the contrary, the tribunal was simply pointing to the need for the word “hold” to be understood as conveying something more than the simple underlying physical concept, given the intent behind section 3(2).” (BUAV, paragraphs 28-29, emphasis added.) 15. The ICO also referred us to two decisions, which being from the first-tier tribunal, are not binding on us. In Digby-Cameron v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0016 (‘Digby-Cameron’), the tribunal stated: “13. The matter is not however to be judged solely on appearances. The Tribunal reminded itself by reference to a decision of the Scottish 3Information Commissioner (Mr Shields and the Scottish Parliament (008/2005) that mere possession of the information would not be determinative of whether the information was held by the Council in its own right. The key issues were as described in that case: “31. If an authority holds information on behalf of another person or organisation, it will not control that information in the same way as it would with information held in its own right. The authority would not have power to delete or amend that information without the owner’s consent; it would not be able to apply its own policies or procedures to it. It may have restricted access to it”. (Emphasis added.) 16. The Digby case referred to McBride v Information Commissioner (EA/2007/0105) where the Tribunal had found that the Privy Council Office (PCO) held the information in its own right, and not on behalf of the University Visitor, stating: “This is not a situation where the information was simply on the PCO’s premises because, for example, the Visitor had left it there. The PCO managed and controlled the information, and in fact the PCO itself produced much of the information contained in the Visitor files. The PCO could edit or delete the information, and it could decide whom to send it to or whom to withhold it from. Indeed, in response to the Appellant’s requests, it could have provided the information to the Appellant, and in fact, did provide some information.” 15.. As part of this deliberation, it asked itself whether the Council had the right to amend or delete the information. The Tribunal noted first that it is the Coroner’s statutory duty under rule 56pf the Coroner’s Rules 1984 to retain inquest documents for at least fifteen years” (Digby-Cameron, paragraphs 13-15, emphasis added.) The Task of the Tribunal 17. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the ICO’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether he should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. 18. For the benefit of the Appellant who may not have received legal advice or legal experience, we note that the Tribunal's role is to be fair and independent, and to try to ensure that appellants are not unfairly prejudiced by not being legally represented. As such, we try to reach the right decision and may ask questions of the parties in order to ensure the relevant arguments are considered, including any pertinent issues or arguments that we are aware of, that an appellant might make were they legally represented. We would also note that this tribunal is independent 4of the ICO. We do not simply accept arguments from the parties without their proper consideration, considering the veracity of their arguments on their merits, and their supporting evidence. 19. We have received a bundle of documents and submissions from the parties, all of which we have considered, even if not specifically referred to below. Having reviewed arguments provided by the parties, we considered it necessary to ask for the contract referred to below - as it had not been provided in the bundle, and for the parties to more fully address certain points that were pertinent to take into account before being able to come to a decision. Issues for the Tribunal 20. The Appellant makes the following contentions in support of his position that the ICO came to the wrong decision: a) POPLA is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA because it is staffed and controlled by London Councils’ staff. (‘Contention 1’) b) Alternatively, POPLA and London Councils are one and the same. (‘Contention 2’) c) The Tribunal is asked to consider if POPLA was prosecuted for Health and Safety breaches, then who would be prosecuted? If a party wished to sue POPLA for defamation then who would be sued? The answer is London Councils in both cases because POPLA does not exist in law. (‘Contention 3’) d) Decisions made by POPLA are passed to the parking company and the appellants, therefore the information is not held solely for BPA but also for appellants and respondents. (‘Contention 4’) e) London Councils has attempted to construct a legal paper wall between itself and POPLA. This is an artificial construct. If this Tribunal refuses this appeal then any public body could create a ‘special vehicle’ similar to POPLA and use it to withhold information. This would fly in the face of the spirit of the FOIA. (‘Contention 5’) 21. We have considered these points below. Contention 1 22. The Appellant argues that POPLA is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA because it is staffed and controlled by staff from London Councils. 23. The ICO responds that POPLA is not a public authority for the purposes of FOIA, because: 1. Neither POPLA nor BPA are public authorities for the purposes of FOIA, as defined in s.3(1) FOIA: neither POPLA nor BPA are listed in 5Schedule 1 to FOIA (s.3(1)(a)(i)), designated by order under s.5 FOIA (s.3(1)(a)(ii)), or publicly-owned companies as defined in s.6 FOIA (s.3(1)(b)). 2. POPLA is a service established by BPA and delivered by London Councils. The 2014 Annual Report of the Lead Adjudicator of POPLA confirms that POPLA is funded by the parking industry. 24. Our Finding: We accept the ICO’s arguments, because POPLA does not fall within the meaning of a public authority which is clearly defined in s3(1) FOIA. Contention 2 25. The Appellant argues that POPLA and London Councils are not distinct bodies. Presumably, the Appellant is seeking to argue that this indicates that the authority is not holding the information ‘on behalf of another person’ within s3(2) FOIA, as this would assist his case. (See paragraph 11, 13 and 17). His statement that POPLA is staffed and controlled by the authority might support this contention, so we have considered that argument here. 26. The ICO maintains that London Councils holds the information requested by the Appellant solely on behalf of BPA, and does not hold the requested information for the purposes of FOIA. Its reasoning in support of this contention included: a) Whether information is held is not a question of purely physical possession. In determining whether information is held by a public authority solely on behalf of another person, it may be relevant to consider the nature of the public authority’s control and use of the information, including the extent to which consent of the other person is required. (See BUAV and Digby-Cameron extracts above). b) London Councils had tendered for (and been awarded) the contract to deliver the POPLA service on behalf of BPA. c) The control and use of the requested information is subject to the direction of BPA. London Councils does not have access to the information for its own purposes. Its access, use and interest in the requested information was undertaken for the sole purpose of delivery of the POPLA service including the requirement under the contract that London Councils provide BPA with appeal statistics on a weekly basis. Although London Councils provides storage facilities for the information, it does so for the sole purpose of delivering the POPLA service under the terms of the contract. 27. We asked the parties to consider the extent to which (a) it might be argued that, where London Councils in performing the contract it is by definition performing a legitimate function in its own interests, and therefore holding the information on its own behalf as well as BPA’s, or (b) whether instead, London Councils is fulfilling the adjudication service on a commercial basis to generate revenue, and not for a public function that it was required to perform as a public authority. 28. The Appellant’s response included: a) ‘On behalf of' means the information is held as agent or representative of a third party with the holder public authority having no further interest in that information. This cannot be applied here as London 6Councils has an interest in the information as it is paid to produce the information.It therefore has an interest and gains a benefit from the production of the information and cannot 'distance itself' from the information for the purposes of FOIA. b) There is a clear public interest in the information requested being released. It is possible that London Councils/POPLA may be favouring or disfavouring a particular private parking company or appellant when dealing with appeals to POPLA. This could, of course, be a corrupt practice, and it is not possible to find out if this is true without sight of the requested data. 29. The ICO responded that when considering whether the public authority holds the information only on behalf of another, or whether it also holds it for its own purposes, the correct approach is to determine whether or not the information in question goes to the public authority’s statutory functions and interests, as opposed to some wider, more diffuse definition of interest. Its arguments included that: a) the requested information is held by London Councils purely as the result of and in relation to a commercial contract of a type which the public authority has no obligation (statutory or otherwise) to enter into and entered into with a view to generating revenue. It is not held in connection with the performance of its statutory duties or functions. b) However, the ICO acknowledged that the issues are not clear cut in that whilst, in his view, a purely commercial activity such as that in the present case doesn’t fall within a public authority’s statutory duties, any profits generated may, of course, be used to further the public authority’s statutory duties (and therefore, its legitimate interests). Therefore, the use to which income deriving from the performance of the commercial contract is put, the resources deployed by the public authority in order to fulfil the commercial contract and other such ancillary matters may well be held for the purposes of FOIA. Nevertheless, the Commissioner maintains that those questions do not arise in the present case: here the specific disputed information is not held. 30. Our Finding: We accept and adopt the ICO’s arguments that have been set out above. In particular, we also note: a) The question of whether the information the Appellant requests is or is not ‘held’ by London Councils is a question of fact for us to determine within the meaning of the FOIA. Under the Act, information is ‘held’ by a public authority when ‘(a) it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person’. (See S.3(2) FOIA)’. Case-law indicates that ‘held’ is not simply a question of whether the material is physically held by the authority. (See paragraph 14 above). b) London Councils holds the information solely on behalf of another person, and that this other person is BPA, and not POPLA. BPA is not a public authority. 7c) The only reason that London Councils physically holds the information is to perform and satisfy the terms of the contract between it and BPA, so that BPA can perform BPA’s statutory requirements. Factors in support of this are: 1. It is clear that London Councils has contracted with BPA to provide an adjudication service, and that the statutory requirement for that service belongs to BPA and not London Councils. London Councils performs that service on behalf of BPA. 2. London Councils has most likely decided to fulfil the adjudication service to generate revenue, as we have not seen any indication that it is doing so to fulfil any public or statutory functions that it is required to perform. Therefore, the only reason that London Councils physically holds the information is in order to perform and satisfy the terms of the contract between it and BPA, so that BPA can perform BPA’s statutory requirements. 3. BPA is privately funded, such that the funds provided to London Councils to perform the contract are not public funds. This supports the conclusion that it is not providing the service in order to satisfy any of London Councils’ public or statutory functions as a public authority. 4. Whilst London Councils physically holds the information, it does not control that information in the same way as it would with information held in its own right. The ICO indicated above clauses in the contract in support of this. (See paragraph 26(c)). The contract additionally contains an intellectual property clause, which makes clear that all materials and work generated by London Councils in providing the arbitration service is the property of BPA and cannot be used by it for other purposes. 5. The Appellant has argued that POPLA is staffed and controlled by London Councils. We accept this. However, we consider that it does so purely for it to satisfy the contract and not to perform some public function of the public authority. 6. The Appellant has argued that there are public interest arguments for disclosing the information. This may be so, but we are not able to consider these as they are not pertinent to the issue of whether the information is held by London Councils. Contention 3 31. The Appellant posed the question: if POPLA were to be prosecuted for breaching health and safety requirements, who would be prosecuted? 32. Our finding: We do not think this argument assists the Appellant’s case. The issue before us is not whether POPLA is independent of London Councils, but whether the requested information physically held by London Councils is also ‘held’ by it for the purposes of the FOIA. It is clear that London Councils performs the 8adjudication service through POPLA, but the ICO argues that it does so purely as an agent of BPA. We note that questions of legal liability for health and safety matters are outside our remit. Contention 4 33. The Appellant also argues that decisions made by POPLA are passed to the parking company and relevant appellants, therefore the information is not held solely for BPA but also for appellants and respondents. 34. Our finding: The question for us to address is not whether the information is held solely for BPA, but whether it is ‘held’ by London Councils for the purpose of FOIA. It is only if it holds it for its own purposes that the Appellant might or would have a right to have the information disclosed to him, and not if it is holding it solely on behalf of another or others that are not public authorities. Contention 5 35. Finally, the Appellant argues that London Councils has attempted to construct a wall between itself and POPLA as an artificial construct, and if we dismiss the appeal then any public body could create a ‘special vehicle’ similar to POPLA and use it to withhold information. 36. Our finding: Whilst we do not agree with the Appellant’s contention, it is not in any event a valid ground of appeal because our remit is restricted to that described above in paragraph 17. 37. In conclusion, we unanimously find in favour of the ICO. Judge Taylor 21 July 2015 9"

Mr Pickthall used to live near Butcher’s Stile Playing Fields in the village of Davenham in Cheshire. He told the tribunal that he was concerned about the welfare of vulnerable people who had been his neighbours and how it was affected by anti- social behaviour on an area of open ground between the playing fields and a road. He has pursued this issue with various public bodies over the years. 2. From 2005 Moulton and Davenham Community Safety Action Group (MADSAG) brought together various agencies including two Parish Councils, West Cheshire and Chester Council, local schools and the police as a means of helping the local community address community safety issues such as anti-social behaviour. The group ceased to exist in 2012. The request for information 3. On 14 August 2014 Mr Pickthall wrote to the Cheshire Constabulary seeking information:- “Official records pertaining to the MADSAG Committee prove your force permitted numbers of its different officers including PCSO [name redacted] to sit as members of the Committee, please confirm the names and ranks of each officer. Please provide me copy of all M.A.D.S.A.G. related correspondence created by those officers to include all correspondence sent to and received from other Committee members and their related Agencies, all notes to include officer note book entries. Please provide me copy of all M.A.D.S.A.G. related correspondence your force exchanged with Cheshire West and Chester Council, Weaver Vale Housing Trust Ltd., Davenham Parish Council, Moulton Parish Council 2005-2013. You will be aware the main function of M.A.D.S.A.G. was to protect the Moulton and Davenham Communities from riotous and Anti-social behaviour and as a result your Force retained copies of the Committees [sic] annual logs, please provide me copy of each Log 2005-2013. 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0065 4. The Constabulary responded on 12 September 2014 (bundle page 26-28). It confirmed that the request would require extensive searches, would be burdensome, was without serious value, it referred to the history of previous requests and concluded that the request was designed to harass. It noted that the police force had already advised him that it would not deal with future requests and drew attention to the concept of a vexatious request. 5. In reply Mr Pickthall claimed that he had conducted research showing that MADSAG and the police had massaged down crime figures, he had circulated the research to a range of public bodies and MPs “shamefully all these trusted servants colluded to suppress my irrefutable evidence”. The request if granted “will further prove your former chief constable and other trusted figures having committed malfeasance in public office… yours is a dishonest, corrupt and untrustworthy police force”. On review the force upheld the decision that the request was vexatious. 6. In considering Mr Pickthall’s complaint the Commissioner reviewed the guidance given in Dransfield on the meaning of vexatious and the submissions of the Constabulary. He noted that a search using relevant search terms had located in excess 9,999 emails which would require in excess of 166 hours to review, in addition to examining any other information sources. He noted that Mr Pickthall’s response to the initial decision was not to seek a review but to publish allegations of corruption malfeasance and dishonestly against individual members of the Constabulary (page 7 paragraph 27). He noted that the Constabulary had expended considerable effort in handling Mr Pickthall’s FOIA requests and accepted the time estimate as reasonable. He considered that the request was a ”manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” and that section 14 operated to stop an individual placing an unwarranted drain on the resources of a public body. He upheld the decision of the Constabulary that the request was vexatious. 7. Mr Pickthall’s appeal simply disputed the finding that his request was vexatious and claimed that s77 FOIA applied – that an offence had been committed by the Constabulary of destroying or concealing information which had been requested. 8. In reply the Commissioner relied on his decision notice and pointed out that since reliance was placed on s14(1) FOIA (vexatious request) the Constabulary had refused to identify the information rather than said the information did not exist. The 5Appeal No: EA/2015/0065 Commissioner noted (page 17 paragraph 8,9) that the request was one of 36 to the Constabulary and there were numerous requests to the Cheshire West and Chester Council, that Mr Pickthall had made 25 complaints to the Commissioner about the Constabulary and Council and that four adverse decision notices had been issued against him and that one of those decision notices was also subject to appeal. During the hearing Mr Pickthall was directed to para.25 of the Decision Notice which states the same facts; he was asked whether he agreed with these figures and he said that he did. He was then asked, in light of the Commissioner's suggestion that Mr Pickthall was misusing FOIA, whether he could see a proportionality issue. His response was ""absolutely"". 9. Mr Pickthall sought to argue that MADSAG had acted in breach of the Data Protection Act since it was not registered as a data controller. He argued against the existence of s14(1) – he argued that it was not justice. He stated that he had been blacklisted, the provision negated a fair hearing and was unlawful. He was unable to advance any argument against the time estimates put forward for retrieving the information sought. He alleged misconduct against the Constabulary and the Council. He argued the merits of what he perceived as the underlying dispute concerning the use put to a piece of undeveloped land near sheltered housing. He alleged a conspiracy to cover up the unlawful use of the land. In the hearing he admitted that he could not sustain his argument that a s77 offence had been committed. He alleged that if the Chief Constable’s mother had lived in the sheltered housing in question, the issues would have been dealt with. He stated “I would put in another 1000 complaints if it would relieve things”. His approach strongly indicated that he viewed the process of making FOIA requests as a means of putting pressure on a public body rather than a means of obtaining information. He expressed the wish to appeal against other decisions. He alleged that he had made concessions in what he was seeking, he was only seeking a log of incidents reported to MADSAG, however he was unable to substantiate this statement that he had reduced the scope of his request. Consideration 10. The tribunal noted that he had made numerous FOIA requests of the Constabulary (36 at 24 November 2014) and the Constabulary’s view that he asserted as true things 6Appeal No: EA/2015/0065 which had not occurred (page 51), that his conduct had been harassing of members of public bodies, the burden that meeting the request would impose and that he seemed to blur the boundary between truth and fantasy – he retreated from some wild assertions of fact when challenged and maintained others in the absence of any evidence. 11. The Constabulary had fairly characterised the request as vexatious and the reasoning of the Commissioner was sound and based on clear evidence. In the hearing Mr Pickthall demonstrated his obsessive approach and the inability to distinguish fact from fantasy as well as a determination to continue with what is clearly an abuse of a statutory process. 12. The tribunal upholds the Information Commissioner’s decision notice and dismisses the appeal. 13. Our decision is unanimous. 14. The tribunal is further satisfied that there may be grounds under The Tribunal Procedure (First-Tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 rule 10(1)(b) for concluding that Mr Pickthall in bringing and conducting this appeal has acted unreasonably. In order to enable this matter to be properly considered the Tribunal directs:- a) The Information Commissioner file details of his legal costs in responding to this appeal within 14 days of the date of this decision and serve a copy of that statement of costs on Mr Pickthall together with any observations he wishes to make on the award of costs. b) Mr Pickthall by 15 August make any representations as to why he should not pay any costs or costs in the sum identified by the Information Commissioner; c) Mr Pickthall by 15 August provide details of his income (including details of his salary and any state benefits and benefits in kind he has received during the last 3 months) and expenditure, including his last 3 months bank statements, details of any other savings, investments or other accounts he has and identify any property he owns with details of purchase price, date of purchase and outstanding mortgage.

"52","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2014/0179 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN HAYDN NEWTON Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Tribunal Brian Kennedy QC Michael Hake Suzanne Cosgrave Hearing: 15 April 2015. Location: Leeds. Decision: Appeal Refused. Subject Matter: Disclosure of information the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and reliance by the Public Authority, the Sheffield City Council (”the Council”), on Section 14(1) in the fact that they regard the requests as vaxa- tious. Introduction: 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the FOIA. The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the DN”) dated 24 June 2014 (reference FS50529749), which is a matter of public record. 2. An oral hearing took place on 15 April 2015 the Appellant only in atten- dance the Commissioner having given his reasons for opposing the Appeal in his Response dated 18 August 2014 to the Grounds of Appeal dated 16July 2014. The Tribunal has been provided with a paginated (1- 270) and in- dexed Open Bundle (“OB”). Background: 3. On 11 November 2013 the Appellant wrote to the Council in the following terms: “Please provide all up to date documentation which states, or will provide supporting evidence, to establish why a member of the council tax paying public has no right to make more than one complaint to Sheffield City Council, and have that complaint investigated under Sheffield City Coun- cil's Complaints procedure and have that complaint forwarded to the om- budsman office. Excluding all FOIA (2000) Act documentation provided already.”. “Now as per Amy Carters e-mail on 2 March 2012 at 16.47, please supply the following under the FOIA (2000) Act. All documentation relating to the bowling green is run by volunteers and a crown green bowling association. Excluding all FOIA (2000) Act documentation provided already. 4. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Appellant made the Commissioner aware of another request made on the same date which was as follows: “How much financial assistance as Sheffield City Council given, donated or provided to every bowling club of which Sheffield City Council own, from January 2012 to September 2013 inclusive.” 5. On 14 November 2013 the Council responded refusing to provide the re- quested information stating that it considered the first two requests per vexatious for the purposes of section 14 FOIA. 6. The Appellant requested an internal review on 21 November 2013 and the Council responded on 11 December 2013, maintaining its position. 7. On 24 December 2013 the Appellant complained to the Commissioner and the Commissioner investigated that complaint. 8. The Commissioner considered that the scope of his investigation covered all three of the Appellant's requests. During his investigation, the Council confirmed that it also wished to apply section 14 (1) FOIA to the third of the Appellant's requests, as well as the first two. 9. Accordingly, the Commissioner considered whether the Council was correct to apply section 14(1) FOIA to the Appellant's three requests of 11 November 2013. He concluded that the Council had correctly relied onsection 14 in relation to the requests of the Council was therefore not re- quired to respond to those requests. The Legal Framework: 10. Section 14(1) FOIA provides that section 1(1) does not oblige a public au- thority to comply with a request for information if the request is “vexa- tious”. 11. FOIA does not define the term vexatious. However, the Upper Tribunal has considered the meaning of the term vexatious at section 14 FOIA in detail in its decision in The Information Commissioner V Devon County Council & Dransfield GIA/3037/2011. Its overall analysis of what may constitute a vex- atious request under section 14 FOIA is found at paragraphs 24 to 39 of that judgment. 12. The Commissioner in his submissions reminds the tribunal of a number of citations in the Dransfield case. However the Court of Appeal has reviewed Dransfield: - Neutral Citation Number: [2015] EWCA Civ. 454 at Para 68: “ In my Judgment, the UT was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word, which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the rel- evant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a re- quest is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of venge- ance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improp- erly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the re- quest was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available. “ The Commissioner’s Investigation and DN: 13. The Commissioner carried out a careful and detailed analysis in his DN and concluded that all three of the Appellant’s information requests were vexa- tious for the purpose of section 14 FOIA, See paragraphs 11 – 24 of the DN [pages 3 to 6 OB]. He later summarized these helpfully for this Tribunal thus;- when taken in its proper context and history, the requests were signifi- cantly burdensome in terms of both expense and distraction (see para- graphs 16 to 18 of the DN); - the requests were lacking in serious purpose or value (see paragraphs 19 to 23 DN) and - the requests would have the effect of harassing and causing distress to council staff (see paragraph 24 DN). 14. In reaching this conclusion, the Commissioner did, in our view, consider all relevant circumstances and, we find properly, balance the arguments put forward by the Council and the information provided by the Appellant. Ultimately, the Commissioner concluded that the Council was correct to apply section 14 FOIA to the requests in this case. This Tribunal have looked carefully and considered the reasoning within the DN (at para- graphs 11 – 24), we regard it as sound and agree and adopt that reasoning. This is after we have heard the evidence of the Appellant himself. The Commissioner’s Response to the Grounds of Appeal: 15. Generally, we accept the Commissioners submission that the Appellant has failed to identify either an error of Law or any incorrect exercise of his discretion. The Evidence: The Appellant gave evidence to the Tribunal in person and made his sub- missions over a number of hours at the oral haring. He confirmed the large number of requests he had made to the Council and identified the volumi- nous correspondence from himself and members of his family to the Council over a protracted period of time. The Tribunal took him from page 134 to page 164 of the HB through what is a summary of communications to the Council from the Appellant and members of his family. We explained to the Appellant that the Council argues that early communications on their own might seem like reasonable requests, but when taken together over a number of years, they did become a burden. These requests commenced in March 2009 continuing to January 2014. He did not dispute the details as we took him through each of them nor did he dispute that he had made threats to staff about going to the Information Commissioner and the South Yorkshire Police. He said, himself to us “ … they (his requests/complaints) took on a life of their own”. The DN sets out clearly the nature of the requests, which were reasonable at the outset, and dealt with, only to be raised repeatedly over a number of years in various guises, but fundamen- tally the same issues. 16. He took a considerable time outlining his grievances. He insisted that he had grievances as a result of the way the Council had treated him as time went on and that he was a victim but failed to demonstrate precisely howthis was so. He did speak of a court case after the Council had referred him to the Police. Criminal charges resulted but he claimed “The magistrates threw it out, saying there was no case to answer”. He stated that: “The Council seem to think they’re God. They don’t care about my rights.”. He claimed the South Yorkshire Police are investigating the Council as a result but gave no further details. 17. The Appellant confirmed that he was frustrated and criticised the manner in which the Council had dealt with him and he had expressed this frustra- tion against the Council. Reasons: 18. The Tribunal accepts and adopts the Commissioner’s reasoning through- out the DN. In fact the Appellant does not argue to any significant degree that the Commissioner is flawed in his reasoning. Rather he seems to ar- gue that the Commissioner has been misled. The Appellant argues, not against the reasoning in the DN per se, except to say that it cannot be right because the Council simply regard and treat him as a nuisance and that, in his view, is not a reason for refusing to deal with his requests. In fact the Commissioner has recognized this in his DN but explains why it is that the request has, in all the circumstances of this case and particularly the his- tory, become vexatious. This Tribunal finds, in the papers before us and through the evidence of the Appellant that the requests from the Appellant had become a burden on the Council. There was unreasonable persistence and frequent overlapping of requests as we discovered when we took him through the summaries at pages 134 to 164 of the HB. We find that the culmination of the communica- tions and requests from the Appellant and his family had reached such a stage on 11 November 2013 that the requests made at that time were likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress in relation to such serious purpose and value that the original re- quests did have. 19. The Tribunal in preparing its decision has noted the Court of Appeal judg- ment in Dransfield (referred to at paragraph 12 above) and in particular Para. 72 which says: “…. Before I leave this appeal I note that the UT held that the purpose of section 14 was “to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA” (UT, Dransfield, Judgment, para. 10). For my own part, I would wish to qualify that aim as one only to be realised if the high standard set by vexatious- ness is satisfied.” We are satisfied that the history of requests in this case is such through their prolonged duration and ultimately, lack of serious purpose or value, that the requisite high standard of vexatiousness is satisfied and the re- sources of the public authority should be protected.20. For the reasons above and adopting a holistic approach, in all the circum- stances, of this case we find that the Commissioner was correct in the rea- soning he applied in his DN. Having listened carefully to the Appellant he does not persuade us that the Commissioner was wrong in his conclusion that the requests were vexatious. We find the Commissioner was correct and the DN should stand. Accordingly we refuse the appeal. Brian Kennedy QC 5th June 2015."
"53","Substantive Refusal","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Tribunal Reference: EA/2014/0086 Appellant: Debbie Bryce Respondent: The Information Commissioner Second Respondent Trinity Hall, Cambridge Judge: Peter Lane Member: Alison Lowton Member: Roger Creedon Hearing Date: 30 April 2015 Decision Date: 10 June 2015 Promulgation Date: 11 June 2015 DECISION NOTICE 1. On 25 February 2013 the appellant wrote to Trinity Hall (“the College”) requesting information that she believed had been deposited in the College’s archives by Trinity Hall Association (“THA”), an alumni association. The appellant’s request was later clarified as a request for archive records of the minutes of meetings of THA, and of its correspondence, in the years 2003 to 2008. 2. The Commissioner found that THA was separately constituted and separately financed from the College; that THA was not a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and that the College, as a general matter, did not have access to THA’s documents. The Commissioner held that THA minutes of meetings for 2003 to 2008 were published on the College’s website and held by the College for the purposes of FOIA but that the College did not hold any other relevant THA correspondence. The Commissioner found that THA minutes for the relevant period were accessible on the College’s website and the College was accordingly not required by the Commissioner to take any steps. 3. It is common ground that the notice of decision is factually incorrect, to the extent that the THA minutes on the website from 2003 to 2008 are the minutes ofthe THA’s annual general meetings. The appellant’s request was directed at the minutes of all meetings of THA, including those of its Committee. 4. The appellant appealed to the First Tier Tribunal. Her case, in essence, is that THA is part of the College, with the result that material held by THA in the private residence of any of its officers, such as the Secretary of THA, is held by the College, which is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA. The appellant also contends that, in any event, the College, as a matter of fact, holds non-AGM minutes and correspondence of THA for the relevant period. 5. The First-tier Tribunal reached a decision on the appeal in October 2014. That decision was, however, set aside by the Chamber President pursuant to section 9 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. He ordered that the appeal be considered afresh by a differently constituted Tribunal, which would not be bound by any previous findings. At the time of the original decision, the College was not a party to the appeal. The College was subsequently made a party and has submitted a response and other written material, including witness statements. 6. An oral hearing of the appeal took place on 30 April 2015 at East London Tribunals, London E14. The appellant appeared in person. The Commissioner did not appear and was not represented. The College was represented by Ms R Kamm of counsel. We heard oral evidence from Dr Chris Angus, Secretary of THA and from Mrs Sheila Hunter, Personal Assistant to the Bursar of the College and its Compliance Officer. The Tribunal endeavoured to assist the appellant in asking questions of the witnesses and generally as to the presentation of her case. When the appellant announced, during the course of the proceedings, that she had not received her copy of the bundle sent to her by the Commissioner, the Tribunal gave the appellant the opportunity of examining the bundle, to make notes thereon and to correlate it with the materials the appellant had in other form. 7. Dr Angus’ statement records that he is an alumnus of Trinity Hall, having matriculated in 1967. He joined the Committee of THA in 2008, subsequently becoming Secretary at the AGM in September 2011. As such, he sets the agenda for meetings, and is responsible for taking minutes, the preparation of reports on THA’s activities and dealing with external correspondence. Dr Angus states that he is also responsible for holding the physical records of THA, with the exception of historic records which have been deposited in the College archives (we note that these relate to a period far earlier than 2003 to 2008). 8. Dr Angus stated that THA is an autonomous body with its own constitution, funding and governance structures. The Governing Body of the College has no representation on THA’s Committee and no control over the operation of THA at either a strategic or day to day level. Control of THA’s finances is under the guardianship of THA’s financial officer, who is the Company Secretary of a major global engineering company. 9. In 2003/2004, a generous benefactor, Dennis Avery, made two large financial gifts. One gift was, in effect, to pay the College to provide secretarial support to THA. The second gift was to THA directly, which chose to have the investment 2managed by the College, where the endowment is ring-fenced, with dividends paid to THA. The minutes of the Committee of THA on 10 September 2003, submitted by THA specifically in connection with this appeal, stress the essential nature of THA being independent of the College: “It should not depend upon the College for funding or become inevitably enmeshed in fund raising”. The template of THA’s stationery, created by Dr Angus, includes the College’s crest as a form of branding but, according to Dr Angus, this is in no way intended to imply that THA is part of the College. 10. THA minutes and correspondence for 2003 to 2008 are, Dr Angus said, held as paper copies in lever-arch files and boxes that, as current Secretary, he holds at his private address. This was so at the date of the appellant’s request. None of this material has been transferred to the College archives, although there had been discussions about the possibility of doing this, which came to nothing. 11. Dr Angus stated that any THA minutes or correspondence materials generated by College staff on behalf of THA were of such a kind that he “can see no reason at all why the College would want to retain copies of such minutes in either paper or electronic form” and that “I do not believe that the collected correspondence for the period in question is available other than from the set of paper records in my possession”. 12. In the course of questioning by the appellant and the Tribunal, Dr Angus said that the College has no control over THA and that the College was used “as a facility” by THA. Two members of the College’s staff attended Committee meetings of THA but they were, in this capacity, under the instruction of THA; rather than the other way round. No one from the College has or could dictate what THA should do. Though an alumni liaison committee had been created a few years ago, it was subsequently done away with. 13. Dr Angus said that he was a “year rep”, a concept borrowed from American Universities, whereby a person is nominated by the College to keep in touch with people of their year of matriculation. Alumni who gave consent to their details being passed to their year rep did not thereby give consent to the information being passed to THA. Accordingly, as THA Secretary, Dr Angus needs to contact the alumnus in question through the Alumni Office of the College, in order to ask whether the person is content to have details passed to THA. If Dr Angus contacted alumni, this tended to be in his capacity as year rep rather than as a THA officer. As Secretary, he has no access to College data, other than that which the College could provide him with the permission of the person concerned. The THA has no access to the College’s computer systems. 14. Dr Angus was asked about the rules of the THA. These set out its objects as follows:- “1. To provide an organisation that will keep Trinity Hall members worldwide in touch with each other and with the College. 2. To ensure that Trinity Hall members’ view are heard in matters connection with the welfare of the college. 3. To arrange social gatherings or other events for the purpose of drawing Trinity Hall members together. 34. To arrange and to hold an Annual Meeting as well as an Annual Dinner in the College. 5. To provide, generate and support other events of interest to members throughout the year”. 15. The Rules also state that all Trinity Hall members who matriculate are automatically members of THA and that such membership is free. The remaining rules deal with the management of THA, through an elected committee, comprising a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Financial Officer and “10 members representing as far as possible Trinity Hall interests, of whom at least 8 shall be current Year Rep at the time of their appointment”. 16. Dr Angus said that the election to the Committee was an informal process, whereby people who could be of use were approached. They would be elected at the AGM, which was open to all members. Dr Angus agreed with the appellant that more information about candidates for election to the Committee could probably be provided to members of THA. 17. Mrs Hunter’s witness statement includes this:- “4. I have been told that Ms Bryce considers that THA is part of the College. Trinity Hall is a college in the University of Cambridge and its members are the Master, and Fellows, along with junior members who are undergraduates and graduate students of the College. The master and fellows constitute the Governing Body of the College to whose meetings are invited junior member representatives (for unrestricted business). The Governing Body is constituted and regulated in accordance with college Statutes. The Governing Body is responsible for the strategic direction of the college, for its on-going administration, and for the management of its finances and assets. Supporting the Governing Body is a range of committees and advisory groups; the THA has no representation on Governing Body or on any college committees or advisory groups (except where they have been invited to sit as external members on now moribund alumni related committees in the past). 5. The Trinity Hall Association is a separately constituted and independently financed and run alumni association. It has its own Rules of Association which set out the purposes of the association and a committee; the Governing Body of the College has no representation on the THA Committee and no control over the operation of the THA. Since 2004 the THA has been financed by the income produced from a gift given to it by a benefactor, prior to that time I understand that it was financed by a one-off fee paid by all alumni on graduation from the College. 6. The College also received a gift from a benefactor in 2004 to enable it to provide secretariat support to the THA via its alumni and development office. The alumni and development office only acts on behalf of the THA and only at the direction of the THA Committee. Typically this involves sending out invitations to THA events on behalf of the THA Committee using the College’s alumni database, processing bookings for 4events, and forwarding correspondence received from the THA, either electronic or physical to the secretary of the THA. 7. College staff are not involved in the preparation or circulation of the agenda and minutes for THA committee meetings nor do they respond to correspondence for the THA, other than in connection with an event booking. Representatives of the alumni and development office are invited to attend THA committee meetings in an advisory capacity but are not members of the committee. It is usually only the development director who attends THA Committee meetings”. 18. Mrs Hunter goes on to state that the College only holds copies of THA minutes (with the exception of AGM minutes) for the period between 1904 and 21 May 1966, which were in a physical form in the College’s archive. The College does not hold any THA correspondence from 2003 to 2008. Details of THA material held in the archive is documented in the on line catalogue known as Janus, which is available to the public and can be accessed via the internet. 19. Mrs Hunter has confirmed this position with both the Fellow Archivist, Dr Pollard, and with Mr Robert Athol, who was formerly the Assistant Archivist. She has also personally visited the archive to examine the documents held. Mrs Hunter has, “confirmed verbally with Mr Athol that he believes that he catalogued all THA material held in the archive prior to his departure in July 2014, and I do not believe that any other THA documents are held elsewhere in the College, other than the material available via the College website”. 20. Mrs Hunter considers that the actions undertaken constitute a “reasonable search of the archive for the information that Ms Bryce requested”. 21. So far as concerns relevant material that might be held by the College otherwise than in its archive, Mrs Hunter stated:- “15. From my discussions with the Development Director, Dr Rachelle Stretch, I believe that the College Alumni and Development Office does not hold copies of the requested minutes, or any THA correspondence, either in hard copy or on the College computer system (email attached). Those minutes that were circulated to staff in the Alumni and Development Office were routinely deleted after any relevant action points had been carried out and to retained by the college in either paper or electronic form and they were not held by the College at the time of the request. The exception to this was the THA AGM minutes which … are available on the College website. No other College staff outside the Alumni and Development Office would have been copied with minutes of THA Committee meetings. 16. Dr Stretch has confirmed to me that, where the College was contacted about a THA matter, other than events, in the period 2003 to 2008 the majority of the communications were hard copy letters which were forwarded to the THA and that the College did not retain a copy. Where the College was contacted about a THA matter by email, the email would have 5been forwarded to the THA committee at their personal email address and the standard practice was for such emails to be deleted once any required action had been completed. Any responses to alumni to such letters or emails would have been made by the THA from their personal email addresses or by post and these replies were not copied to the College. The tha@trinhall.cam.ac.uk address to enable emails to be relayed to the THA committee was not introduced until the beginning of 2013.” 22. Under questioning by the Tribunal and the appellant, Mrs Hunter stated that the decision as to what to hold in the archive was made by the Archivist, who would decide what would be accepted. She confirmed that she had spoken to the Assistant Archivist, who said that he had catalogued all the THA material held in the archive; but that Mrs Hunter also went to the archive herself, but could not find anything. College correspondence would be retained by the College but THA correspondence is forwarded without taking a copy, since it is not regarded as the College’s correspondence. Correspondence would be shared amongst staff only if there was a need. 23. The College’s case is that at no material time did it hold any information falling within the scope of the appellant’s request, with the exception of the AGM minutes which were available on the website. The materials held by THA at the home of Dr Angus are not held by the College for the purposes of the FOIA, because THA is not part of the College. 24. The College’s case has two further aspects, which only come into play if THA is part of the College and/or THA material within the scope of the request is held by the College. These are that the THA material may be exempt from disclosure by reason of section 40(1) and/or 40(2) of FOIA; and that the appellant’s request was vexatious. 25. The appellant considers that, far from being independent, THA exists only to serve the development function of the College. She believes it is necessary to see any contract that may exist between the THA benefactor and the College. Only a perusal of THA Committee minutes would show whether independence has been achieved. THA is in the nature of a “virtual” organisation that exists only by reference to the College. The part played by the College’s staff in THA affairs underscores this point. 26. The appellant thinks it is implausible that the material is not, in fact, held by the College in its archive. The appellant had been informed that there was space for such material to be held. Conversations with a librarian in another institution reinforced the appellant’s view that the material was, in reality, held. 27. We have had full regard to the submissions, both written and oral, and to the oral and written evidence, including that not specifically referred to in this decision. Our decision on the appeal is unanimous. 28. The Tribunal has considered carefully and holistically the issue of whether THA is part of the College for the purposes of the FOIA. Having done so, we are in no doubt that the THA is a separate entity for these purposes. We accept the 6evidence we have heard in this regard from the witnesses. The objects of THA, set out above, make it plain that – contrary to the appellant’s views – THA does not exist in order to serve the development function of the College. In other words, it is not the College’s fund-raising arm, or even part of it. Of course, the fact that THA is an association of alumni of the College means that it has a connection with the College. However, the degree of that connection, on the evidence, falls far short of showing any legal right or de facto ability of the College to control or otherwise influence THA. 29. The fact that staff members of the College provide secretarial support to THA, as a result of funding made available by a benefactor, is not indicative of any control or other influence by the College on THA’s affairs. We see no reason to reject the evidence of Dr Angus regarding the distinction drawn between his position as year rep, on the one hand, and his position as Secretary of THA on the other. We find that Dr Angus and the College keep separate the data protection position of alumni, vis a vis the College and THA respectively. 30. In this regard, we note from the materials that the appellant has asked THA not to provide the College with copies of THA’s correspondence with the appellant; a matter which underscores the separate nature of the two entities. 31. The appellant submitted that it was necessary to examine a contract between the benefactor and the College regarding services provided to THA. There is, however, no reliable evidence that any such contracts exist. In any event, we consider the evidence adduced by the College regarding that relationship to be truthful. Given that one of the aims of the benefaction was to ensure the independence of THA, it would frankly be remarkable if any such contract were to have produced the opposite result. 32. We anticipate the appellant may criticise the Tribunal for failing to pursue this matter with the “robustness” she may wish. However, the Tribunal must act on such evidence as is before it and the appellant has not begun to show that it would be in the interests of the overriding objective to compel disclosure of any such contract. On the contrary, to do so would merely be to enter into what is often referred to as a “fishing expedition”. 33. Accordingly, none of the material held by the Secretary or other officers of THA, relating to the relevant period, is held by the College as a public authority under the FOIA. 34. We turn to the issue of whether THA material for 2003 to 2008, within the terms of the appellant’s request, is held by the College, whether in its archive or otherwise. In this regard also, we have carefully considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, particularly those of the appellant. She considers that it is implausible that no such material is held. She derives assistance from this view, inter alia, because of her understanding that there is space in the archive and because of what she understands to be the views of the librarian of another institution. 35. The issue for the Tribunal is whether it is more likely than not that the material is held by this public authority. Having considered the evidence, in 7particular that of Mrs Hunter, who (like Dr Angus) we found to be an entirely credible witness, we are fully satisfied that it is more likely than not that the material is not held. Mrs Hunter has explained the nature of the investigation she has undertaken in relation to the archive. Those investigations are, we consider, of an entirely reasonable nature. 36. We also find as a fact that it is more likely than not that the relevant material does not exist elsewhere in the College. Given the nature of THA and of the College staff’s involvement, we find it entirely plausible that any such material which the staff might take away from meetings would not be retained for more than a short period and, certainly, not from 2003 to 2008. The evidence makes it plain that such staff would have no reason to keep the THA material. The appellant’s questioning of Mrs Hunter on this issue failed to disclose any hint of such a reason. 37. We allow the appeal to the extent that the Commissioner’s notice of decision falls to be read as if, in paragraph 20, the reference to minutes in the last sentence were a reference to minutes of the THA’s AGMs in 2003 to 2008 and that the decision notice should record that non-AGM minutes for 2003 to 2008 are not held by the College. No action, however, falls to be taken as a result of this amendment. 38. Otherwise, for the reasons we have given, the appeal is dismissed. Because we have found that THA is not part of the College, it has not been necessary for the Tribunal to reach any findings on the alternative submissions of the College as regards the issues of data protection and vexatiousness.

"54","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0278 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FER0530613 Dated: 6 October 2014 Appellant: ANDREW REEVES-HALL Respondent: THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER On the papers Date of decision: Before CHRIS RYAN (Judge) and ANNE CHAFER JEAN NELSON Subject matter: Exceptions, Regs 12(4) and (5) Request manifestly unreasonable 4(b) Cases: Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC).IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0278 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION Background to this Appeal 1. On 21 November 2013 the Appellant sent Hampshire County Council (“the Council”) a request for information about a 20 mph speed restriction zone in Whitchurch. The request stated that it was made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 although, as is now conceded on all sides, the subject matter brought it within the parallel freedom of information regime established under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”). 2. The Council relied on EIR regulation 12(4)(b) in refusing the Appellant’s information request and, following an investigation instigated by the Appellant’s complaint about that refusal, the Information Commissioner issued a Decision Notice on 6 October 2014 in which he concluded that the Council had been entitled to rely on that exception. 3. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice with this Tribunal on 13 October 2014. He indicated that he wished his appeal to be determined on the papers, without a hearing. We agree that it was appropriate to deal with the appeal on that basis. We have therefore reached our decision on the basis of the Appellant’s written Grounds of Appeal, the Information Commissioner’s written Response and a Reply to the Response filed by the Appellant. We were also provided with a bundle of relevant documentation. The relevant law 4. EIR regulation 5(1) requires public authorities that hold environmental information to make it available on request. That obligation is expressed to be subject to various exceptions set out in Part 3 of EIR. The exception relied on by the Council (regulation 12(4)(b) ) permits a public authority to refuse to disclose information to the extent that therequest for information is “manifestly unreasonable”. The exception is itself subject to a proviso, set out in regulation 12(1)(b), to the effect that the exception only prevents disclosure if “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 5. The term “manifestly unreasonable” is not defined in the EIR. However, it was considered in the Upper Tribunal case of Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC). The decision was based on FOIA section 14, which permits a public authority to refuse a request made under that statute if it is “vexatious”. However, Upper Tribunal Judge Wikely stated that in practice there is no material difference between the two tests under section 14(1) and regulation 12(4)(b). Accordingly, we have approached this appeal with the following passage from Dransfield firmly in mind: “27. The common theme underpinning section 14(1), at least insofar as it applies on the basis of a past course of dealings between the public authority and a particular requester, has been identified by Judge Jacobs as being a lack of proportionality (in his refusal of permission to appeal in Wise v Information Commissioner GIA/1871/2011; see paragraph 17 above). This issue was also identified by the recent FTT in Lee v Information Commissioner and King’s College Cambridge at [73] as a relevant consideration. … I agree with the overall conclusion that the FTT in Lee reached, namely that “vexatious” connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” (at [69]).” 6. Judge Wikely went on to identify four questions which he suggested might help those considering whether or not a request was truly vexatious. They were: i. How great a burden did the request impose on the public authority and its staff? ii. What was the requester’s motive? iii. Did the request have value or a serious purpose? iv. Was there any evidence of the requester harassing staff members or causing them distress? However, he went on to make it clear that those considerations were not intended to be exhaustive and that they should not be treated as a formulaic check-list. 7. Since we met to reach our determination we have become aware that the Court of Appeal has heard an appeal from the Upper Tribunal in Dransfield. The Court supported the decision reached by Judge Wikely. 8. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58, adapted to apply to cases falling under EIR. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the InformationCommissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. The Decision Notice under Appeal 9. The Information Commissioner set out in the Decision Notice the whole of the Appellant’s request for information. The length and detail of the request are apparent from paragraph 5 of the Decision Notice, which quotes it in full. He then referred to the four factors from Dransfield referred to in paragraph 5 above, but considered the case by addressing the following questions: a. was the request likely to cause the Council a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress; and, to the extent that this might not be clear b. was the impact on the Council of complying with the request out of balance with the purpose and value of the request? The Information Commissioner also made it clear that he approached these questions having in mind the history of dealings between the Appellant and the Council leading up to the submission of the information request. 10. The Information Commissioner cited 28 information requests, which the Council said that it had received from the Appellant since 2011, and relied, also, on a considerable body of other written comments and requests received in that time from the Appellant, as well as many communications sent by him to the Appellant’s County Councillor. By reference to the 20 mph speed limit referred to in the information request, the Information Commissioner referred to two detailed requests submitted by the Appellant to the Council prior to June 2013 and to the Council’s decision at that date that it would not consider any further requests on that subject, in reliance on EIR regulation 14(1)(b). 11. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Appellant appeared to wish to have an ongoing dialogue with the Council, with regular feedback on issues that interested him, and that, overall, the resources needed to comply with his communications had impacted on the Council’s ability to deal with other business. While it was accepted that the Appellant had a public spirited attitude and there was a degree of public importance to the issues of road safety he raised, the Information Commissioner found that the persistence with which he pursued the issues that concerned him, the level of detail of his questions and the speed of response he expected, compromised the Council’s ability to maintain an adequate level of service to other people. The Information Commissioner concluded that if the Council responded to the information request it was likely that the Appellant would make further requests and that it had therefore been appropriate to rely on the exception provided under regulation 12(4)(b).12. The next stage of the Information Commissioner’s decision-making process was to apply the public interest test balance, as required by regulation 12(1)(b). He found that the public interest in openness, transparency and the disclosure of environmental information was outweighed by the public interest in preventing further public resources being diverted to respond to the Appellant’s information request. The Appeal to this Tribunal 13. The Appellant asserted in his grounds of appeal that his information request was justified by the seriousness of the subject matter and the Council’s failure to communicate adequately with the residents of Whitchurch during previous stages of the process for testing, implementing and amending a 20 mph restriction. He did not seek the information for his own purpose but to enable him to inform others as part of his role as an editor of the town’s news and comment website. The website, he asserted, attracts many readers and generates dialogue on road traffic issues through published letters and public media. 14. The Appellant also made the point that each of the three information requests concerning the 20 mph zone had focused on a separate stage of its roll-out and did not therefore constitute inappropriate duplication. Finally, he challenged the suggestion that some of his other requests, which did not focus on road safety issues, lacked value. 15. In his Response to the Appeal the Information Commissioner drew attention to both the number of requests which the Appellant had submitted, the period of time which they covered (approximately four years) and the length and complexity of some of them. He referred to the Council’s estimate that it would have taken 10 hours of staff time to answer the request under consideration (although we were provided with no information about the basis for the estimate) and stressed the burden on Council staff caused by both information requests and other communications emanating from the Appellant. He also argued that the pattern of behaviour in the past justified the Council in concluding that, if it had answered the information request, it would have been faced with further follow-up questions: the burden imposed on the Council would, it was said, be carried over to the future. 16. The Information Commissioner also relied on the level of detail sought in the information request, and in previous requests. This, it was said, was excessive and disproportionate in the circumstances. It went beyond the level of detail at which the Appellant was entitled to engage in the issues that interested him and deprived the information request of much of its value and serious purpose. This was said to be the case notwithstanding that the Appellant had assumed a role as a campaigning journalist at the level of the town’s website publication. The Information Commissioner submitted that the information requestformed part of a prolonged endeavour by the Appellant to use freedom of information processes to exert influence over what the Council did and how it did it. It amounted to the sort of irresponsible use of those processes, which the Upper Tribunal had declared unacceptable in Dransfield. 17. The conclusion urged on us by the Information Commissioner was that the purpose or value of the information request was limited and was outweighed by the impact on the Council, its staff and resources of having to deal with an average of eight, normally lengthy, requests per year from the Appellant, in addition to other communications from him. The Council had therefore been justified in its reliance on regulation 12(4)(b) and the burden imposed on the Council outweighed the presumption in favour of disclosure, due to the limited value of the request. 18. In his Reply document the Appellant stressed the importance and potential value of the speed restrictions and the tight focus of his information request on that issue. Our consideration of the issues 19. We do not believe that we have been provided with any information that would enable us to accept either the Council’s suggestion that responding to the information request would involve ten hours of staff time, or the Appellant’s assertion that the requested information would have been “easily available”. 20. The materials provided to us included a table of all 33 FOIA requests identified by the Council and relied upon by the Information Commissioner in support of his argument that the information request should be regarded as manifestly unreasonable in the context of the course of dealing between the Appellant and the Council over a four year period. There have been a number of other enquiries and communications which were not formal FOIA requests. Of the FOIA requests fifteen concerned highway matters generally, of which five related to cycling and three to the 20 mph speed limit scheme. Those three contained a total of 20 questions between them. 21. In relation to those three requests, neither the Council nor the Information Commissioner provided a persuasive response to the Appellant’s argument that each request touched on a different phase of the roll-out. Nor were we presented with a compelling argument that, viewing the whole history of requests, the Appellant tends to respond to the release of information with a further request seeking, without justification, further information derived from the first response. 22. In the case of one or two of the requests we believe that the Council would have had a stronger case for asserting that they were manifestly unreasonable than in the case of the information request underconsideration in this appeal. We have taken into account the scope and nature of all the requests as part of our evaluation but consider that, more important than the number submitted (and that a few may have been particularly light on serious purpose), is the level of detail that the Appellant frequently sought. For example, he was apparently not content to know, in broad terms, what results were generated by a particular speed survey, but required spreadsheets showing full data on speed, vehicle type, direction and time of the day for every recorded movement at every monitoring site. In other cases he wished to be provided with copies of all correspondence from the public on a particular topic or to have responses from the public broken down between those received by post and those online, accompanied by a copy of every response received. 23. Although the Information Commissioner made a passing reference to the absence of generosity of spirit evident in the Appellant’s communications, we do not think that the suggestion that Council staff suffer harassment, irritation or distress as a result of the Appellant’s activities carries any significant weight. 24. Nor do we think that the Appellant’s role as a self-appointed investigatory on-line journalist places him in a position where the normal tests for assessing a manifestly unreasonable request may be wholly disregarded. An individual in that position may be able to demonstrate that the role he or she has adopted attracts sufficient support and/or interest from the public to demonstrate that each of a larger number of requests than normal, with a wider range of topics, retains sufficient value and serious purpose to justify the burden laid on the public authority to whom the requests are addressed. But the test to be applied remains the same as that to be applied to any requester, including the level of detail of the information sought. 25. Measuring the appropriate level of detail may be affected, in respect of that type of enquirer as much as any other, by the adequacy and accuracy of information previously released by a public authority. A follow up enquiry, even a series of such enquiries, may be justified if a previous request for information, possibly expressed in relatively general terms, has generated an incorrect, evasive or obstructive response. However, that does not mean that members of the public, acting either on their own part or as a representative of others (self- appointed or not), will have unlimited rights to demand an excessive level of detail, in either a first or subsequent request. 26. In our view this is the area in which the Appellant’s pattern of requests tips into being manifestly unreal. Those elected to public office have obligations to base policy decisions on an appropriate level of properly investigated evidence. If and to the extent that they are shown to have failed to pursue such sound decision-making process, the public has a right to be informed of what went wrong, possibly through detailed requests for information exploring the body of evidence on whichdecisions were based. It does not follow that requests may in all cases seek that detailed level of disclosure without risking a finding that they are manifestly unreasonable. 27. In our view the Appellant went too far, in the information request under review and some of his previous requests, in requiring the Council to unearth and disclose a quantity of information, at a level of detail, which was not justified by the underlying issue of concern. Overall, therefore, the burden placed on the Council, set against the value or serious purpose of the underlying issue, tips the balance in favour of a finding that the exception applies, on the facts of this case. The information request, as formulated and in the context of the history of requests submitted to the Council, should therefore be regarded as having been manifestly unreasonable. 28. On the question of the balance of public interest, we consider that the Information Commissioner was correct in concluding that the public interest in the disclosure of the quantity of information sought was not equal to the public interest in avoiding the Council being burdened in the manner, and to the extent, identified above. 29. We have concluded that the Information Commissioner was right to conclude in his Decision Notice that the Council had responded appropriately to the information request by refusing it in reliance on regulation 12(4)(b). The Appeal should therefore be dismissed. 30. Our decision is unanimous. ……….. Chris Ryan Tribunal Judge 1st June 2015"
"55","Procedural Refusal","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 EA/2014/0240 B E T W E E N:- LINDA TAYLOR Appellant -and- INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Heard on the papers: Judge Carter’s Chambers, London Date of Consideration: 21 April 2015 Before Melanie Carter Judge and Henry Fitzhugh and David Wilkinson Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 21 May 2015 Decision: The appeal was dismissed 11. Linda Taylor, the Appellant, is appealing against the Decision Notice with reference FS50525784 issued by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 3 September 2014. The Decision Notice related to requests for information made by the Appellant to the Governing Body of Parrs Wood High School (the Governing Body) on 26 October 2013. On 27 September 2013 the Appellant wrote to the Governing Body requesting information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). This related to the suspension of a school Governor (her husband) in 2011, a subsequent judicial review overturning the suspension and matters relating to a further suspension of the same governor in June 2013. On 9 October 2013, the Governing Body responded to the request. 2. On 26 October 2013 the Appellant requested further clarification on certain of the responses already made by the Governing Body (see Appendix to the Decision Notice). The Governing Body designated these follow up questions as new requests for information under FOIA. Having received no further response from the Governing Body, on 24 November 2013, the Appellant requested an internal review of the Governing Body’s decisions. Later that day the Governing Body requested proof of the Appellant’s identity; there followed further correspondence on this point (including in relation to an earlier request by the Appellant under a pseudonym). 3. On 8 December 2013 the Governing Body stated that it was refusing the requests made on 26 October 2013 on the basis of section 14 FOIA, that is that the requests were vexatious, stating that it considered that the requests were being made as part of a campaign. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who in turn upheld the Governing Body’s decision. The Commissioner did not consider the Governing Body’s compliance with FOIA in relation to the requests of 27 September 2013. Rather, the Commissioner considered whether the Governing Body had been correct to rely on section 14 FOIA in relation to what it treated as the new, follow-up, requests made on 26 October 2013. 4. This is an appeal in relation to the Decision Notice of the Commissioner and the Tribunal’s task is to determine whether it is in accordance with law. The Law 5. Section 14 of FOIA provides: “14. – (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious”. FOIA does not define the term “vexatious”. However, when considering the application of section 14, the Tribunal now looks to the binding decision of Information Commissioner v Devon County Council & Dransfield (Upper Tier Tribunal reference GIA/3037/2011). Between the hearing of this appeal and the issuing of this decision, the Dransfield case was considered at the Court of Appeal. That decision is not referred to here as it predated the parties’ opportunity to make submissions and the date upon which the Tribunal met to decide this matter. It is noted however that the Court of Appeal upheld the Upper Tier Tribunal’s decision. 26. By way of overview, Judge Wikeley at the Upper Tier Tribunal stated at paragraph 10 of that judgment that: “The purpose of section 14…must be to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA”. 7. Therefore, whilst making it clear that they were “not intended to be exhaustive, nor … meant to create an alternative formulaic check-list”, Judge Wikeley took the view that it was helpful to approach the question of whether a request was truly vexatious by considering four broad issues or themes which were set out at paragraph 28 as follows:- (1) The burden placed on the public authority and its staff; (2) The motive of the requester; (3) The value or serious purpose of the request; and (4) Any harassment of, or distress caused to, the public authority’s staff. 8. Judge Wikeley commented at paragraph 43 that: “…The question ultimately is this – is the request vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA?” 9. The UT proceeded to caution against a too rigid approach to deciding whether a request is vexatious, noting that it is an inherently flexible concept which can take many different forms. 10. In his most recent guidance on section 14 FOIA, drawing in particular on the Dransfield case, the Commissioner set out that he considers that section 14(1) is designed to protect public authorities by allowing them to refuse any requests which have the potential to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. 11. The Tribunal reminded itself of the important distinction that the issue is whether the request is vexatious, rather than the requester. Background to the request 12. It is relevant background to this appeal that in December 2011 the Governing Body was involved in judicial review proceedings following the suspension of a particular parent Governor, Fergus Kilroy; Mr Kilroy is the Appellant’s husband. The court found that the Governing Body’s decision to suspend the Governor had no effect and, as a result, the governor was reinstated. It appeared that it was on the basis of the marital relationship and the similarity in subject matter of the requests for information, that the Governing Body had concluded that the disparate requests for information, taken over a period of time were part of a concerted campaign. 313. The Governing Body produced a schedule of communications, the so-called ‘evidence log’, as between on the one hand the Appellant and her husband and on the other, the Governing Body, Manchester City Council, the Department of Education and the Commissioner. The communications from the two individuals, albeit made up in part of chasers to earlier requests for information and the responses of the public authorities, ran to 91 pages. 14. The Commissioner set out in paragraph 26 of the Decision Notice the questions asked by the Appellant’s husband of the Governing Body and/or other public authorities. Some of these related to either 2011 minutes of the meetings of the Governing Body or the judicial review mentioned above. 15. Whilst a proportion of the communications were to public authorities other than the Governing Body, the Commissioner argued that given these emanated from the same people and covered the same or similar ground this supported the assertion that the request was part of a campaign. 16. Also by way of background to this appeal, the Tribunal noted that the Appellant had made a previous FOIA request using a pseudonym, Harvey Scott. It appeared that this had been occasioned by concern that the Governing Body would not respond if it knew that it was Mr Kilroy’s wife who was making the request. In the event, the Information Commissioner’s Office had advised the Appellant to make this request using a pseudonym and it was this that had occasioned the Governing Body’s request that she identify herself. 17. The Commissioner found at paragraph 41 of the Decision Notice that “there is evidence to suggest the complainant is making requests in conjunction with another individual and that taken together the frequency and nature of the correspondence would be likely to be categorised as vexatious.” The evidence 18. The Appellant had provided a variety of documents in the Open Bundle (some 63 pages) including Mr Kilroy’s written evidence to the Education Committee of the House of Commons, a letter from the Clerk to that Committee and a letter from a “Secret Teacher” at Parrs Wood High School (the School). 19. The Governing Body had provided the Commissioner with the evidence log referred to above. In addition, the Tribunal had sight of a letter dated 4 August 2014 from the Headteacher to the Commissioner. The letter contained the following: a) A concern that the Appellant would conduct herself in a similar way to Mr Kilroy pursuing his previous FOIA request “(ie: a response by the School immediately leading to either further linked questions or, where the School advises that it does not hold requested information, a challenge as to why the School does not hold the requested information)”. 4b) In relation to question 11 of the request for information, “while the School would not normally have any objection to disclosing the existence of this [Service Level Agreement], our concern in the present case, as indicated above, is that this would trigger another series of e-mails from Mr Kilroy directly to individual members of the Council’s Legal Services Team”. c) That this matter had been going on for a period of over 3 years and “[t]he amount of resources dedicated to responding to Mr Kilroy’s complaints and queries has been immense”. It was said that the School was aware that Mr Kilroy had also made a number of FOIA requests to the Council asking the Council to provide information to him as to the costs to the Council of dealing with his judicial review against the Governing Body. d) That the matter had been considered and effectively resolved by the High Court on judicial review; e) That Mr Kilroy had already been provided with a large amount of information by way of disclosure under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). The Schoolwas aware that Mr Kilroy had also made two subject access requests as well as “numerous FOIA requests” to the Council. The Appellant’s submissions 20. The Appellant’s main contention was that the evidence log actually only amounted to one FOIA request (in contrast to the portrayal of there being multiple FOIA requests) and then necessary follow up communications chasing the non-compliance with the one request. 21. The Appellant told the Tribunal that she was aware that her husband had made a request in relation to the costs of the judicial review. She further stated that the suggestion that she had been “acting in concert and [part of] a campaign is simply not accurate.” She argued “the definition of several is more than two. A campaign suggests organised actions.” Thus, it appeared that the Appellant’s case was that the Tribunal should not accept that she and her husband were acting as part of a campaign in making FOIA requests, as Mr Kilroy had in effect only made one FOIA request and she also had only made one request; two requests, it was said, were not sufficient to amount to a campaign. All other communications by her and her husband were not to be taken into account as they were either follow up communications to those requests or were for information under different legislative regimes or roles (eg: Mr Kilroy asking questions in his role as Governor or making a subject access request under the DPA). 22. Also and perhaps in the alternative, with regard to the issue of burden, the Appellant argued that the Tribunal should only consider the effect of her one FOIA request dated 27 September 2013 with her request for further clarification on 26 October 2013, all other matters being either not part of a campaign or mere follow up to the Governing Body’s non-compliance with her husband’s earlier FOIA request. The Commissioner’s submissions 523. The Commissioner concluded in the Decision Notice that there was evidence that the Appellant’s requests were being made in conjunction with or in the knowledge of a large number other requests made to the Governing Body on the same topic. The Commissioner further took into account that the requests sought to obtain views rather than information from the Governing Body, thereby entering into a debate about issues which had already been resolved (by way of the judicial review proceedings) and that complying with the requests (both as to views and providing information) would impose a disproportionate burden in terms of time and other resources, distracting the Governing Body from its main functions. 24. The Commissioner submitted that each individual question asked in the request met the criteria in section 8 FOIA as a separate request for the purposes of FOIA. Analysis 25. The Tribunal carefully analysed the evidence log in light of the detailed written submissions of the Appellant, in particular the so-called “Matrix Commentary”. The Tribunal was doubtful of the Commissioner’s treatment of the email of 27 September 2013 as amounting to 12 requests and was of the view that the better approach was to see this as one FOIA request. 26. The Tribunal accepted the view of the Governing Body and the Commissioner in turn that the Appellant and her husband were acting in concert given their evident marital relationship and the similarity in the subject matter of all the correspondence in the evidence log and the request for information that is the subject of this appeal. 27. That said, the Tribunal took into account that a large proportion of the communications detailed in the evidence log were made by Mr Kilroy in his role as Governor, not under the FOIA regime. Certain communications concerned subject access requests made by him under the DPA. It was accepted by the Tribunal moreover that a proportion of the communications were legitimately follow up letters/emails on account of the Governing Body not clearly complying with their obligations under FOIA. 28. That said, and even accounting for these factors, it was clear that there had been a substantial amount of correspondence between the Appellant or her husband and the Governing Body, the Council and the Department for Education. It was quite clear from the evidence log, that however one analysed the actual number of FOIA requests, the context of the request that is the subject of this appeal was a weight of prior communication all linked to the pair’s underlying concerns. The net effect was to create a significant burden on the Governing Body. 29. Whilst the Commissioner had asserted in the Decision Notice that the request was “without merit or value to the public”, the Tribunal considered on the contrary that these were matters of legitimate public interest, namely the expenditure of public funds on litigation and behind that the unlawful suspension of a Governor. This amounted to a purpose which originally commanded a genuine degree of public interest. 630. However, there came a point, at some stage between the original suspension in 2011 and the eventual referral to the ICO more than two years later on 27 December 2013, at which, the right thing for the Appellant and Mr Kilroy to have done would have been to pass matters to the Commissioner to investigate. Instead and despite knowing of the proper mechanisms for this, they continued with their pursuit of the broad range of information they were seeking through chasing correspondence, a subject access request and a further FOIA request. This was despite the Appellant being fully aware of the Commissioner’s role in these matters (she had made a complaint in relation to a FOIA request to Manchester City Council to the Commissioner in late 2012). The fact that the husband and wife had continued to correspond and make further requests (across the different regimes) and to write persistently to the Governing Body complaining about a failure to make disclosure instead of invoking the Commissioner at an earlier stage was evidence, in the Tribunal’s view, that the intended effect behind this request was, in part, to maintain pressure upon the public authority. 31. The Tribunal adopted the holistic and broad approach commended by the Upper Tier Tribunal in Dransfield, and balanced the purpose of the request against the detrimental effect of compliance on the Governing Body. It was clear that even with the legitimate purpose and value identified above, the negative impact (see the evidence from the Headteacher) on the Governing Body was such that this fell squarely into the category of vexatious requests. The Governing Body, and the Commissioner in turn, had been entitled to rely upon section 14 of FOIA in refusing disclosure of the information requested. 32. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal. Its decision was unanimous. Judge Carter 21 May 2015 7"

Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL EA/2014/0168 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 19 June 2014. 2. It arises from a request for information made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) by the Appellant, Ms Pip Martyn, to the Second Respondent, St Albans City & District Council (the “Council”). 3. The Appellant lives on Marquis Lane in Harpenden, adjacent to a play area for children and an open space (the “Open Space”), as well as Batford Springs Local Nature Reserve (“Batford Springs”). In 2009/2010, concerns were expressed about damage to the grass verge boundary of the Open Space resulting from parking by visitors to these amenities, as well as more general concerns about congestion and the lack of parking for the residents of Marquis Lane. In response, the Council carried out a consultation exercise with residents of properties bordering the Open Space to consider options for resolving these issues. 4. In May 2012, ownership of the Open Space and Batford Springs transferred from the Council to Harpenden Town Council. The Request 5. The Appellant’s request, made on 25 May 2013, was for e mail correspondence between Councillor Dean Russell and other parties relating to Marquis Lane. Specifically, the request was made on the following terms: “…If possible, I would like to request to see any email correspondence between Councillor Dean Russell and the following – Harpenden Town Clerk (John Bagshaw), Councillor Pawle, Cillr Leadbeater and the general public with the words Marquis Lane in since July 2011…” 6. At the time of the request, Dean Russell was a St Albans District Councillor for Harpenden East, Albert Pawle was a St Albans District Councillor as well as a Harpenden Town Councillor, and Simon Leadbeater was a Harpenden Town Councillor. 7. On 24 June 2012, the Council informed the Appellant that although information within the scope of the request was held within the e mail accounts of individual Councillors, it considered that this related not to the Councillors’ executive roles as part of the Council Cabinet, but to their “private political or representative” purposes, and therefore, that the information was not “held” by the Council for the purposes of FOIA. -3-8. The Appellant sought an internal review. On 16 August 2013, the Council notified the Appellant that having conducted an internal review, it was upholding its earlier decision. 9. On 12 February 2014, the Council disclosed a number of e mails which it had obtained from Harpenden Town Council which fell within the scope of the Appellant’s request and which it considered were now in the public domain. However, the Council maintained that it did not hold these e mails at the time of the Appellant’s request, nor indeed at the time of the internal review, and therefore that it had no obligation to provide them. The Commissioner’s Decision 10. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner. For the reasons set out in its Decision Notice, the Commissioner found that the information was not held by the Council. 11. In brief, the Commissioner reviewed the e mails held within the e mail accounts of individual Councillors, and agreed with the Council that these did not relate to Council business. They related either to the Councillor’s role as Ward Councillor, or personal matters, or to business external to Council activities. 12. The Commissioner accepted that the e mails which the Council had obtained from Harpenden Town Council and had passed on to the Appellant, were not held by the Council as at the date of the request. The Appeal to the Tribunal 13. The Appellant has appealed to the Tribunal against the Decision Notice. The Tribunal joined the Council as a Second Respondent, pursuant to Rule 9 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009. 14. All parties have requested that this appeal be determined on the papers without an oral hearing. Having regard to the nature of the issues raised, and the nature of the evidence, we are satisfied that the appeal can properly be determined without an oral hearing. 15. We have considered all the documents received even if not specifically referred to in this determination, including in particular, the documents in the agreed bundle, and such written submissions as have been received from the parties. None of the parties relies on any witness evidence. 16. We have also considered the parties’ replies to certain specific questions we asked during the course of our deliberations. 17. The Appellant made a separate request to Harpenden Town Council. That was the subject of a separate appeal (EA/2014/0139), which has already been determined. -4-The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 18. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal against the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 19. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. Issues 20. The only issue to be determined in this appeal is whether, as at the date of the request, the Council held any information within the scope of the request, for the purposes of FOIA. Findings 21. Under section 1(1)(a) of FOIA, a person who has made a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed, in writing, whether the public authority holds that information. Under section 1(1)(b), he is entitled to have that information communicated to him. The duty under section 1 does not arise if any of the exemptions set out in FOIA apply. No such exemptions are being relied on in the present case. The Council simply says that as at the date of the request, it did not hold the information. 22. The right of access established by FOIA applies only to information held by the public authority. The only question in this appeal is whether, as at the date of the request, the Council held the information requested. 23. There are two parts to this question in the context of the present appeal. The first is whether the Council held certain information in the sense of having it, physically. The second question is whether, even if the Council had certain information physically, it “held” it for the purposes of FOIA. 24. FOIA does not define what is meant by “held”. It does not use terms such as “power, possession or control” that are found in other legal contexts, nor does it adopt the language in the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 which provide that “held” means information that “is in the authority’s possession and has been produced or received by the authority.” What it does do, however, is to exclude from the disclosure requirements of FOIA, information that is held by a public authority on behalf of another person. By virtue of section 3(2), such information is not “held” by the public authority for the purposes of FOIA. -5-25. Section 3(2) provides as follows: (2) For the purposes of this Act, information is held by a public authority if- (a) it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person, or (b) it is held by another person on behalf of the authority 26. The Council does not dispute that as at the date of the request, there were e mails on its server relevant to the request, in particular, e mails sent or received by Councillor Dean Russell. However, the Council says that the information was not held by the Council, on its own behalf, because these e mails related to issues concerning the Councillor’s ward function rather than Council matters. Accordingly, by virtue of section 3(2)(1), the Council says that it did not hold this information for the purposes of FOIA, but held it on behalf of another person. 27. By way of further explanation, the Council says that Councillor Russell’s Council e mail address was set up to hold, only temporarily, e mails before forwarding e mails to his own private e mail account(s). This was because he could not access e mails sent to his Council e mail address unless he was actually in the Council building. The e mails were sent to his private e mail account(s) so that he could respond from other locations. 28. The Commissioner agrees with the Council as regards the distinction between a Councillor’s ward function and executive function. He draws a parallel with information held by a public authority about an MP’s parliamentary work and his constituency work. He has also drawn attention to one of his previous decision notices (FS50422800) in which he said, in relation to the role of Councillors: “…[Councillors] will act as a representative of residents of their ward e.g. holding surgeries, corresponding about particular constituents’ issues and looking into complaints. However, this is not an executive function of the councillor as an individual representative. Information held by councillors in this role is not therefore covered by FOIA as it is not information held by (or on behalf of) the council…” 29. We note that the distinction between a Councillor’s ward and executive functions, and its implications in relation to FOIA requests, is also explained in the Commissioner’s guidance on “Information held by a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act”. This states as follows, at paragraphs 28 et seq, under the heading “Local Councillors”: 28. Having discussed the two legal principles set out in FOIA at section 3(2)(a) and (b), it may be useful to consider the position of councillors in local government because information held in relation to them can involve both these principles. This derives from the fact that elected members of a council are likely to have a number of different roles. Some will relate to their function as elected members (for example, corresponding with residents in their ward, discussing council business -6-with fellow members in the context of voting strategy or campaigning on behalf of a political party) and some will relate to the functions of the local authority (for example, being a cabinet member and having executive responsibility for a service area, carrying out administrative functions or representing the authority, such as on a regional forum). 29. Information produced or received by councillors may be held on their own computers or in their own homes or offices, or it may be held on local authority premises or computer systems. However, the purpose of the information and the capacity in which it is being held is more helpful when deciding whether information is covered by FOIA. 30. Local authorities are public authorities for the purposes of FOIA, but individual elected members are not. Therefore, information held by councillors for their own purposes will not be covered by FOIA, but information they hold on behalf of, or as part of, the local authority will be covered (section 3(2)(b)). 31. Information created or received by a councillor but held on a local authority’s premises or computer system will be covered if it is held by the authority on its own behalf (section 3(2)(a)). It will not be covered by FOIA if it was produced by the councillor for private or political purposes and the authority is just providing storage, office space or computing facilities (ie the authority is not holding the information to any extent for its own purposes). 30. However, although we accept this distinction between a Councillor’s ward and executive functions, we consider that in practice, the distinction will often be is less clear-cut in the context of local government than say, Westminster, where there is likely to be a clearer separation between parliamentary and constituency business. 31. The appellant does not dispute the distinction, but disputes whether the information in issue in fact related to non-executive functions. She is not persuaded by the Council’s explanation that e mails relating to ward functions were sent to Councillor Russell’s Council e mail address only because he could not access his e mails externally, particularly since, as she points out, that he works in the information technology field. Be that as it may, it is the nature and content of the e mails and whether they relate to the Councillor’s executive function on the Council, or to his representative functions, not their location, that determines whether they are “held” for the purposes of FOIA. 32. The Commissioner has said, at paragraph 18 of his Decision Notice, that having examined the e mails in question, he considers that none of them are about Council business. In response to our request to have sight of those e mails, the Commissioner has clarified (and the Council has confirmed), that the e mails were the same ones obtained from Harpenden Town Council (referred to at paragraph 9 above). 33. As already noted, those e mails have now been provided to the Appellant, and copies have been included in the agreed bundle. Nevertheless, if they were -7-“held” by the Council, they should have been disclosed from the outset, so the question as to whether they were held is one that still needs to be addressed. 34. The e mails in question primarily cover the period from 22 July 2011 to 24 May 2013. They are from Councillor Dean Russell and others, or to him and others. As to whether they relate to executive or ward matters, in our view, it would be disproportionate to attempt to apply the distinction to every e mail individually, and indeed, since the Appellant now has the information, there would be little to be gained from such an exercise. We have also not been invited to distinguish one e mail from another, and none of the parties have themselves referred to any specific e mails, or parts thereof, in support of their positions. In our view, the only sensible approach is to view these e mails as a whole. Viewed in that way, we consider that the e mails are follow ups from a meeting on 19 July (which we will refer to further below), representing efforts by Councillors to find a more satisfactory solution to concerns raised by constituents. On that basis, we are satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that they relate to ward rather than executive functions. 35. In support of her contention that Councillor Dean Russell was acting in his executive capacity, the Appellant refers to a meeting she attended on 19 July 2011 (i.e., just before the period covered by the e mails in question), which she says was convened as part of a planned District Council led consultation process regarding parking. She says that this meeting was chaired by Mr Deakin, the Council's Environmental Compliance Officer, that there were at least three Councillors present, and that it is unreasonable to dismiss the meeting as having no Council status. She further says that Councillor Russell was a District Councillor and that his engagement since that meeting would have required further consideration of District matters in relation to parking and parking enforcement. She says she fails to understand how this was not Council business. 36. The Council says that the meeting on 19 July 2011 was not in fact a District Council meeting, and that the Councillors were not attending as representatives of any District Council function. The Council refers to the letter at page 5 of the bundle which it says indicates that the meeting was a public consultation meeting arranged by Steve Deakin in his capacity as a Parking Services Manager for the Council. It further says that Councillor Russell attended as a Ward Councillor, and the e mails that followed were therefore discussions in his Ward Councillor capacity. 37. We consider that the status of that meeting is not entirely clear. As an exercise in seeking a closer understanding of the residents’ views, we consider that it was ward business. If, as it appears, it was convened and chaired by an officer of the Council, then it looks less like a matter simply between Councillors and their electorate. Nevertheless, we do not consider that this is determinative of the status of the e mails that followed. As we have already indicated, we are satisfied, from their content, that those are fairly characterised as relating to ward business. 38. The Appellant has also said that the e mails in question are not the whole picture, and that at the time of her request on 23 August 2013, the Council -8-also held other information coming within the scope of the request. She says, in this regard, that the Council disclosed some relevant e mails to another individual in response to his information request. As we understand it, she is referring here to information provided pursuant to a request submitted by her partner’s father in July 2013. That request was made on the following terms: “…If possible, I would like to request to see any email correspondence and their attachments between Mr Steve Deakin and the following – Harpenden Town Clerk (Mr John Bagshaw), Cllr Julian Daly, Cllr Dean Russell and Cllr Mike Wakely in relation to Marquis Lane since Jan 2009…” 39. On 23 August 2013, the Council confirmed, in response to the above request, that “…an email search was carried out on Steve Deakin’s archive using the above criteria. Approximately 500 messages and attachments were found, the results of which are attached to this letter…” 40. The Appellant contends that some of these e mails also fall within the scope of her request, for example, an e mail sent from Councillor Dean Russell to John Bagshaw, which was copied to Steve Deakin. She argues that if the Council was able to disclose this information in August 2013, it must have held the information at the time of her request in May 2013. 41. The Commissioner put this point to the Council. In reply the Council confirmed that it had erred in stating that it did not hold any relevant information at the time of the Appellant’s request. It accepts that these e mails were held in Mr Deakin’s email account at some point and should have been disclosed. As to why the Council had not disclosed them in response to the Appellant’s request, it says that Mr Deakin had checked his e mails and informed the Council at the date of the request, that he did not hold e mails within the scope of the Appellant’s request. The Council further says that Mr Deakin left the Council some months ago, and that his e mail account has now been deleted. 42. The Appellant complains that the Council did not conduct a thorough initial search or chose not to release the information in response to her request, and then deleted an archive of information which was relevant not only to an on- going FOIA request, but also relevant to an on-going investigation by the Local Government Ombudsman. The Council strongly refutes any suggestion that it hid or deliberately destroyed information coming within the scope of the Appellant’s request. 43. We make no findings of impropriety on the part of the Council for not disclosing these e mails sooner. We are sympathetic to the Appellant’s frustration, and we recognise that those requesting information are often at a disadvantage when challenging a public authority which says it does not hold certain information, because they are not able to inspect for themselves the public authority’s files. It may be that the Council could and should have been more thorough in its inquiries. However, there is no evidence to support a -9-finding that it deliberately withheld this information, nor indeed that it is withholding any other information. 44. We find, however, that the Council failed to comply with section 1(1)(a) and 1(1)(b) in failing to confirm that it held the e mails referred to at paragraph 41 above, and in failing to provide them to the Appellant. Since these e mails have now been provided to the Appellant, no further steps are required to be taken. Other points 45. There are a few further points we should address. In relation to the e mails that the Council obtained from Harpenden Town Council, the Appellant says that the Council should have obtained these at an earlier stage. That argument is misconceived. A public authority has no obligation to obtain information that it does not hold in order to respond to a request. If the information is not held by it, there is no duty to obtain the information in order to disclose it. 46. Second, during the course of replying to our further inquiries, the Council has said that it discovered that the e mails it sent to the Appellant on 12 February as having been received from Harpenden Town Council, do not correspond exactly to the e mails in the agreed bundle which were intended to be copies of those same e mails. On the basis that the appellant has been provided with all the e mails in question, whether on 12 February or by way of inclusion in the agreed bundle, we do not consider that anything further is required. 47. Third, the Appellant has pointed to what she says are shortcomings on the part of the Council or individual Councillors. For example, she asserts that the Council failed to consult residents appropriately, she criticises the Council's current schemes in neighbouring areas, and she says that Councillor Dean Russell failed to use his e mails appropriately or communicate effectively. However, these are not issues that we can deal with; we have no jurisdiction under section 58 of FOIA to consider matters which are unrelated to whether the Decision Notice is in accordance with the law. Decision 48. Except as set out at paragraph 41 above, The Appellant’s appeal is dismissed. 49. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Date: 7 May 2015 Anisa Dhanji Judge - 10 -"
"57","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2014/0072 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN EAST DEVON DISTRICT COUNCIL Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER and Respondent JEREMY WOODWARD Second Respondent Tribunal Brian Kennedy QC Suzanne Cosgrave Paul Taylor Appearances: For the Appellant: Tom Cross of counsel. For the First Respondent: Robin Hopkins of counsel. For the Second Respondent: Richard Thurlow. Hearing: 28 August 2014, 18 February 2015 & 20 March 2015. Location: Exeter Magistrates Court. Decision: Appeal Refused. Date of Decision: 5th May 2015 Subject Matter: The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR’s”) and reliance by the East Devon District Council, (“the Council”) on Regulation 12(4)(e) EIR’s to withhold disclosure of the requested information. Regulation 12(4)(e) EIR’s provides that a public authority may refuse to dis- close information to the extent that the request involves the disclosure of in- ternal communications.Introduction: 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the FOIA. The ap- peal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commis- sioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the DN”) dated 10th March 2014 (refer- ence FS50498100), which is a matter of public record. 2. An oral hearing took place on 28 August 2014 and for a number of reasons (some of which will be referred to below) deliberations were delayed until the panel was in a position to meet again on 18 February and 20 March 2015. How- ever, as will be explained, the matter has still not been satisfactorily or finally re- solved. 3. In this appeal, the Tribunal has been provided with a paginated (1- 100) and in- dexed Open Bundle (“OB 1”) along with a number of different Closed Bundles which the Council has provided at various stages and which contain the withheld information, which for obvious reasons is not in the public domain, or with the Second Respondent. We have a bundle of authorities helpfully provided by the Commissioner. We have also been provided with helpful final submissions from the Council and the Commissioner both dated 22 December 2014. Background: 4. The DN concerned a request for information under the EIR’s by the second re- spondent made on 14 February 2013 for information concerning the Appellant's proposed relocation of offices from its base in Sidmouth (Knowle) to different premises. The request was for (i) minutes (“unredacted minutes of all groups in- volved in the Relocation from Knowle”), and (ii) reports (“the Relocation Manag- ers formal Progress Report”) relating to the proposed relocation. It is to be noted that the disputed information includes a number of reports and some part reports, not just one. 5. The commissioner decided that the requested information was “environmental” within the meaning of regulation 2(1) EIR’s and that “the minutes” requested at (i) had been correctly withheld, the exception in regulation 12(4)(e) (“internal com- munications”) applied to them and the public interest balance favoured maintain- ing that exception. These issues are not in dispute between the parties in the course of this appeal. 6. However the Commissioner also decided that under part (ii) of the request, “the reports” did not constitute “internal communications”, that regulation 12(4)(e) EIR was therefore not engaged in relation to part (ii) of the request and that as this was the only exception upon which the appellant relied therefore the reports should be disclosed and the first respondent so ordered. This is the main issue in this appeal. 7. The Council argues that the reports, in their entirety came within regulation 12(4)(e) EIR and the public interest balance favours the maintenance of that ex-ception, for the same reasons, they argue, as were accepted by the first respon- dent in relation to the minutes. 8. Alternatively, if the reports are ordered to be disclosed, the Council now argues, before the Tribunal, that certain sections of the reports should be withheld (re- dacted) on the grounds of regulations 12(5)(b) (course of justice) and 12(5)(e) (confidentiality of commercial information) and identifies those passages it seeks to redact in the event of disclosure being ordered. 9. There is no dispute that the reports constitute “communications”. The issue is, whether in the particular circumstances of the facts in this case, they constituted “internal” communications. 10. In the course of the relocation procurement exercise the Council had entered into a contract with Davis Langdon (“DL”), retaining their services in principle by the engagement of their consultant expert Mr. Pratten who authored the reports, which comprise the disputed information in this appeal. The appellant argues that Mr. Pratten was sufficiently “embedded” within the public authority to the extent that his reports comprised “internal communications” for regulation 12(4)(e) pur- poses. The Issues: 11. The tribunal accepts that it is not possible, or desirable, to attempt to devise a standard test as to what constitutes internal or external communications. Each case will be decided on its own facts. However the Commissioner has consid- ered [see paragraphs 23 to 25 of the DN] his own guidance and the extremely limited circumstances in which a communication with a third party are considered “internal”. Both in his DN and in this appeal he considered the two decisions of DfT V IC (EA/2008/0052) and South Gloucestershire Council V IC and Another (EA/2009/0032). The Tribunal finds this helpful in that the parallels with this case, on the evidence, are in our view, closer to the South Gloucestershire Council case. Little in the evidence that we have heard or read in this appeal has led us to believe that the Commissioner made an error in the DN in this regard. 12. The Council argues, it is necessary to understand the role of the author of the reports and the circumstances and nature of the reports, in substance as well as in form. The Commissioner argues that the relationship between the council and Mr. Pratten provides context but what ultimately matters is not the relationship but the communications themselves. Both are correct but the Tribunal having heard the evidence and considered the reports on the facts before us in this ap- peal are unanimously of the view that in this case the reports were external communication. Reasons:13. It is accepted that Mr. Pratten was “embedded” to an extent in the Council in the course of his work. However it is also accepted that he was a Chartered Sur- veyor with over 35 years experience working in the construction industry who commenced working for Davis Langdon (now an Aecom Company) and was at all material times employed by them as a Senior Project Manager. He was sec- onded to the Council following a successful tender submission and interview: his work was as an independent and external expert seconded to advise on behalf of his employer, (“DL”) who invoiced the Council on a monthly basis for this exper- tise, advice and input. This is the context in which he was embedded. Of course it meant he was and had to be familiar with discrete and confidential information and had to comment on and report on all aspects of the proposed relocation but his input was as an independent expert on those issues that he could contribute to the matters the Council were to make decisions on. The important distinction from being a council employee, officer or decision maker within the public author- ity always remained. He provided important input on behalf of his employer DL and always did so with their support, authorisation and the obligation to report back to his employer with all draft reports to which he was to put his name and the name of DL before they were issued. 14. In evidence Mr. Pratten confirmed that he did attend the DL offices at Bristol and discussed updates of his work, debriefing with directors at DL. While most of these discussions were about costs and did not require input from his directors there were other aspects to this reporting back to his employer both in terms of quality control and professional indemnity insurance and risks to the employer in that regard. He confirmed he used a DL laptop and email address and also con- firmed that his reports were based on a DL template. Although all the reports (the disputed information) had first been seen in draft by Mr. Cohen (at the Council) for consideration and comment, (See witness statement of Steve Pratten dated 12 August 2014) they had then gone to partners in DL. Thee reports were, he confirmed, in fact approved and they had been variously signed off by one of two DL partners, prior to going to the Council, one in the Plymouth office and one in the Bristol office. He agreed that if he had written something inappropriate, they would have picked it up and they even corrected typos. He confirmed that if he became ill and was unable to attend to the contract, DL would supply his re- placement. He further confirmed that DL’s processes meant they would retain copies of those reports in their backup files. The Tribunal therefore finds as a fact on this evidence that the reports had been provided externally and subject to sign off by DL. Further, this appears from the evidence to have been before the request made by the second respondent on the 14 February 2013. 15. These reports therefore are clearly distinct from the requested information under (i) which were council minutes of council meetings. 16. Mr. Cohen, the Deputy Chief Executive of the Council gave evidence. When asked what part the reports played in the procurement process he answered that: “They inform discussion. They provide options e.g. in securing new accom- modation for the council”. He confirmed that by engaging DL, they, through Mr. Pratten give the weight of professional support. With all the information available to them “on the table” including the reports, the council can make their decisions.He confirmed that if Mr. Pratten were not available they would have reverted to DL under the terms of the contract to provide a further consultant in his place. He agreed that the reports were on DL notepaper and by virtue of the language em- ployed to all intents and purposes looked like and were a DL report. 17. The Council argues that Mr. Pratten was effectively a council employee in all but name, that he spent all his time in their offices and was totally immersed in this procurement project. He had little to do with DL and they had little to do with his work. That, in our view is not the test. We find that at all times he was an inde- pendent expert who advised and those advices were made by, and on behalf of, and approved by DL. Indeed within his own witness statement Mr.Pratten de- scribes himself as follows: ""I am...employed and reimbursed by Davis Langdon /Aecom - an independent External Consultant, but take instructions exclusively from Mr. Cohen..."". The Council argues that Mr. Pratten had access to confiden- tial and sensitive information and the reports contained such information. While this is undoubtedly true, it does not make the reports internal. The Council in the alternative can and does rely on other exceptions to seek redaction where confi- dentiality and sensitivity or the public interest otherwise requires or demands non-disclosure. It is our unanimous view that in all the circumstances and on the facts presented to us at this appeal, the reports referred to in part (ii) of the Re- quest were external. 18. We accept the Commissioner’s submissions that overall the Council was devel- oping this project through means which were partly internal and partly external. Mr. Pratten’s reports, they argue were predominantly external. He was an exter- nal party to whom the public authority afforded a significant degree of internal access but he at all times remained an external party. While we accept that he was continually engaged (even “embedded”) with council officials and staff and discussing confidential and sensitive issues, he was primarily an independent expert advisor with that limitation and distinction pertaining at all material times. 19. We agree with the Commissioner that regulation 12(4)(e) was not engaged with respect to the disputed information relevant to part (ii) of the Request in this case because (a) the reports were never “internal” communications and/or (b) even if they had at some stage been “internal” communications, that “internal” quality had been lost by the time of the request, by which stage they had been disclosed externally to other individuals at DL. 20. However the Commissioner makes a further argument in relation to the applica- tion of regulation 12(4)(e) EIR and that is that it must be construed in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC (tab 2 of the bundle of authorities). Under that Directive, exceptions to the duty to disclose information must be interpreted in a restrictive way: see Recital 16 and Article 4(1). 21. The Directive (and the EIR’s) must in turn be interpreted so as to give effect to the Aarhus Convention (at tab 3 of the bundle of authorities). It is clear that public access to environmental information is of fundamental importance. As cited by counsel for the Commissioner: The Aarhus Convention provides at Article 4(3)(c) that a request for information may be refused if; “The request concerns materialin the course of completion or concerns internal communications of public au- thorities where such an exemption is provided for in national law or customary practice, taking into account the public interest served in disclosure”. 22. The Aarhus Convention is explained in its official “implementation guide” and the relevant extract from the current version, in place as of April 2003 is at tab 4 of the bundle of authorities and the corresponding extract from the version in place up to April 2013 is at tab 5. We accept it is appropriate to take the Implementa- tion Guide into consideration in this case before us. 23. Again citing counsel for the Commissioner, the current version says this (tab 4 of the bundle of authorities at page 79; “The second part of this exception con- cerns “internal communications”. Again, parties may wish to clearly define “inter- nal communications” in their national law. In some countries, the internal com- munications exception is intended to protect the personal opinions of government staff. It does not usually apply to factual materials even when they are still in pre- liminary or draft form. Opinions or statements expressed by public authorities acting as statutory consultees during a decision-making process cannot be con- sidered as “internal communications”. Neither can studies commissioned by pub- lic authorities from related, but independent, entities. Moreover, once particular information has been disclosed by the public authority to a third party, it cannot be claimed to be an “internal communication”. 24. The same points are made in the previous version of the Implementation Guide see tab 5 of the bundle of authorities at page 58. 25. We accept the analogy made in submissions by the Commissioner that the re- ports relevant to (ii) of the Request are analogous to “studies commissioned by the Council from a related, but independent entity” (see the penultimate under- lined sentence in the extract cited at 22. above). We agree with the narrow in- terpretation of internal communications as submitted by the commissioner and find the DL reports, the disputed information herein, fall within the wider context of external communications because in all the circumstances of this case, they are on the facts DL reports. 26. Accordingly for the above reasons we find that regulation 12(4)(e) EIR’s is not engaged and the DN stands correct and this appeal is refused. Regulations 12(5)(b) (course of justice) & (e) (confidentiality of commercial information) EIR’s: 27. The Council after the DN was issued sought in their Grounds of Appeal, in the alternative, to limit disclosure under the above two exceptions by way of redac- tion where appropriate in the reports to be disclosed. 28. At this stage the Tribunal have done their best to read all of the closed material, which should amount to all the disputed information or reports requested. It has been difficult to do so, some 6 pages were only legible in the final version of the Closed bundle we received (Closed supplemental Trial Bundle Filed on 3 March 2015), we have had no opportunity to have any submission from the parties onthe views taken by the Tribunal on the application of EIR 12(5)(e) and further we remain uncertain as to whether or not all the relevant information has been pro- vided to us. As an example, it appears (from the Closed bundle) that a report ""5"" issue date 7 January 2013 exists, whereas we have only seen report ""5A"" (9 January 2013). Pending clarification of this we propose to order disclosure of that information which we have been able to consider against the above exemptions, on a staged basis. We will do so initially through a closed annexe to this judg- ment, on 5 May 2015, until any proper objections can be considered and by way of Directions in relation to those pages upon which we require further submis- sions. Interim Conclusion: 29. The Tribunal orders disclosure of all information to which the Council has applied regulation 12(4)(e) but not that in respect of which either regulation 12(5)(b) or (e) has been claimed and either this has been accepted by the Tribunal – as in- dicated by REDACTION ACCEPTED in its Closed annex or the Decision on any claimed exception remains pending as indicated DECISION PENDING in its Closed Annex and in relation to the Directions issued, until the Tribunal has ruled finally on those 6 pages. 30. Disclosure must not take place until after the time for an application for permis- sion to appeal and any such appeal has been determined or discontinued. Other Matters: 31. This Tribunal takes the unusual and unfortunate step of commenting on the con- duct of the appeal itself. We are unanimous in our view that this appeal has taken much longer than it should have done and the reason for this seems to be the failure on the part of the public authority, the appellant, to address itself with sufficient attention to the details of what information and documents it was sup- plying to the Commissioner and ultimately also to the Tribunal. It was not until March 2015 that a fully legible copy of the disputed information was supplied and seemed to be complete. This is, in our collective experience, wholly exceptional and the time spent dealing with what we believe to be five different sets of dis- puted information is simply not a good use of the Tribunal’s time nor fair, in terms of delay, to the requester. Correspondence on behalf of the Council, rather than ensuring the Tribunal was assisted in its function, was at times discourteous and unhelpful including the statement that we had the most legible copies possi- ble. A statement, which was clearly inaccurate as subsequently, we have been provided with perfectly legible documents. We believe this appeal could and should have been dealt with completely at the hearing in August 2014 and the decision promulgated six months ago had the Council discharged its responsibili- ties properly.

Hearing: 10 March 2015. Location: Bedford House, Belfast.. Decision: Appeal Refused. ! Subject Matter: The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and reliance by the Second named Respondent (“the Public Authority”) on Section 31(1)(d) in deciding not to release the requested information. ! Introduction: ! 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the FOIA. The appeal is against the decision of the the Information Commissioner (“the Com- missioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the DN”) dated 11 September 2014 (reference FS50532511) which is a matter of public record. ! 2. An oral hearing took place on 10 March 2015 where the Appellant appeared as a Litigant in Person, the Commissioner relied on his DN and his written Re- sponse dated 24 October 2014, to the Grounds of Appeal from the Appellant dated 7 October 2014 and the Public Authority was represented by Christina Michalos of counsel.Background: ! 3. The Appellant wrote to the Public Authority on 3 December 2013 and his request for information was made in the following terms; ! (1) Total number of fuel laundering operations (raids) carried out by the HMRC in County Armagh in 2013/14 to date? (2) How many successful prosecutions were made in relation to those operations (raids in question (1) ? (3) In relation to question one how many arrests were made? (4) In relation to question one how many cases are pending in respect of fuel fraud? ! 4. On 23 December the Public Authority responded stating : “I can confirm that HMRC holds information of the type specified in your request. However, we are withholding the information under section 31(1)(d) of the the FOIA. This allows public authorities to withhold information if its disclosure - - - would be likely to prejudice the assessment or collection of any tax or duty”. ! 5. Following an internal review the public authority wrote to the Appellant on 24 January 2014. It upheld the original decision in relation to the exemption at sec- tion 31(1)(d) FOIA. ! Scope of the Case: ! 7. The Appellant contacted the Commissioner on 10 February 2014 by way of complaint against the Public Authority’s handling of his request for information. ! Legilslative framework: ! 8. Section 1 of FOIA provides two distinct but related rights of access to information that impose corresponding duties on public authorities which are: a) The duty to inform the applicant whether or not requested information is held and, if so, b) the duty to communicate that information to the applicant. ! 9. Section 31(1)(d) of the FOIA states that: “Information which is not exempt infor- mation by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice - (d) the assessment or collection of tax or duty or any imposition of a similar nature.” ! ! ! The Decision Notice: ! 10. The Public Authority’s position is that the requested information is exempt information under section 31(1)(d) as disclosure of such area specific information in this instance would be likely to be used by those minded to undermine HMRC’s strategy in dealing with fuel fraud and as such have a detrimental im- pact on its ability to assess and collect tax.! 11. The Public Authority confirmed that it had previously released similar information to the Appellant for the financial year 2012 to 2013 but this was for Northern Ire- land in its totality rather than a specific region. ! 13. The Commissioner, having viewed the withheld information and considered the matter found that the exemption was engaged. His view was that the request is specific to one area of Northern Ireland and the detail sought would be likely to aid those that are or would be involved in fuel laundering either in that locality or generally. The Commissioner accepted that the specifics sought would enable them to more effectively estimate how successful the Public Authority are in locating the said illegal activities and in pursuing prosecutions. This would, the Commissioner found, be a valuable aid in deciding how likely it is or is not that they will be apprehended and this may lead to more unlawful tax evasion and fuel laundering. ! 14. Section 31 is a qualified exemption so the public interest test set out in section 2(2)(b) must be applied. That is, the information can only be withheld if the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest the public in- terest in disclosure. The Commissioner referring to a Tribunal decision in “Hogan” (EA/2005/0026 and 0030) properly identifies and recognises that “While the pub- lic interest considerations against disclosure are narrowly conceived, the public interest considerations in favour of disclosure are broad-ranging and operate at different levels of abstraction from the subject matter of the exemption.” ! 15. To quote the Commissioner in his conclusion at paragraph 18 of the DN,; “On balance the Commissioner finds that the public interest favours maintaing the exemption. The Commissioner appreciates that releasing the information will enable the public to determine the effectiveness of HMRC in tackling this kind of fraud in County Armagh. However counter-poised against this is that such a release will facilitate and assist those that will commit the fraud in question. This in turn means that the financial loss to the public purse will increase and to make it more difficult in preventing the said loss. On balance these factors outweigh the somewhat relatively limited factors in favour of release.” ! The Grounds of Appeal: ! 14. The Appellant effectively argues that the Commissioner erred in finding the exemption under section 31(1) (d) was engaged with respect to the withheld information and further that he erred in concluding that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. ! 15. The Appellant argues further that a request for information regarding such a large area as County Armagh would not be so clearly defined as could be used to undermine HMRC strategy in dealing with fuel fraud which would lead to a detrimental impact on its ability to assess and collect tax. ! !16. The Commissioner notes this argument from the Appellant but maintains that disclosure of the withheld information would set a precedent which the Public Authority would have to follow when dealing with similar requests in the future concerning other specific areas. This according to the Commissioners’ reasoning means that the likely prejudicial effect of disclosure would come not just from the disclosure of the specific information for County Armagh, but rather from the matrix of information which could be developed following disclosure of such in- formation for most, if not all counties over a similar time period. ! 17. The Commissioner accepts the arguments from HMRC that, given its limited re- sources, disclosure of the withheld information may assist those so minded to build up a picture of the Public Authority’s operational activities and may help to complete a picture of the HMRC’s overall national activities. ! 18. The Commissioner considered this aspect carefully and accepted the Public Au- thority’s assertion that the withheld information would be a valuable aid to those involved in fuel laundering in deciding how likely it is or is not that they will be apprehended and that this may lead to more unlawful tax evasion and fuel laun- dering. ! 19. The Appellant argues further that the Public Authority on a regular basis discloses location specific information about their activities into the public domain on public websites, examples of which are listed in the grounds of appeal. How- ever the Commissioner distinguishes the examples given as they relate to indi- vidual raids carried out. This, the Respondents argue is different to statistics which comprise the withheld information in this case. ! 20. The Commissioner then deals further with the Public Interest test issue raised in the Appellants Grounds of Appeal, at paragraphs 22 to 27 of his Response dated 24 October 2014 (See pages 23 - 25 OB). ! 21. This Tribunal accepts and adopts the reasoning of the Commissioner and finds the detailed and extensive evidence, of an experienced operative in the field, produced at the oral hearing fully supports the position taken by the Public Authority and the Commissioner in support of the application of the exemption in the circumstances of this case ! REASONS ! 17. The Tribunal, like the Commissioner, have seen the closed material comprising the withheld information and accept that this information per se would not add significantly to the public interest, as perceived by the Appellant, on disclosure of same. ! 18. Even if there were any doubt about that, this Tribunal have had the advantage of hearing the evidence of both the Appellant and Mr. Michael Parkinson, acting Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation Directorate. !19. The appellant himself gave evidence. He failed to persuade the Tribunal that the Commissioner was wrong in his assertion that there was little weight to be given to public interest by disclosure of any of the requested information. The Appellant was unable to demonstrate a the hearing any significant benefit to be attached to disclosure in terms of the public interest test. ! 20. Submissions by Counsel made on behalf of the Public Authority can be summarised thus: a) The withheld information is fact specific - the details sought would be likely to aid those and would be a valuable tool for criminals. b) the disclosure would set a dangerous precedent, c) allowing those intent on crime to create a Mosaic effect of data with information already published (which was demonstrated to be voluminous and significant) through the statistical equivalent of a jig saw effect. Other submissions included the risk to the safety of employ- ees of the Public Authority by the use of the withheld information by criminal gangs to undermine their detection operations. ! 18. If there were any doubt about the veracity and sound reasoning given by the Commissioner in his DN and in his Response to the Grounds of Appeal, the Tri- bunal then had the advantage of hearing the evidence of Mr. Parkinson. He is an experienced officer with service in the detection of fuel laundering fraud. Perhaps the most significant and weighty evidence from this expert in crime detection was the concern of disclosure of specific detail that would allow the professional ca- reer criminals to gain intelligence into the Public Authority’s operations to detect crime and bring prosecutions. He indicated also that serious threats of violence from those criminals involved was a matter of significant concern and risk as- sessments to staff safety were also issues of raising further concern to him. Of most relevance he confirmed that disclosure of the specific nature in this request on a specific County basis would in his opinion allow criminals to piece together intelligence that they could use to their advantage in their criminal activities. He gave evidence that he was firmly of the view that disclosure of the disputed in- formation was not in the public interest. ! 22. We repeat, accept and adopt the reasoning of the Commissioner as set out in the DN and his Response to the Grounds of Appeal as supported by the detailed submissions by counsel on behalf of the Pubic Authority based also on the evi- dence of Mr. Parkinson. ! 23. For the above reasons we refuse the appeal herein. ! ! Brian Kennedy QC 8th April 2015."
"59","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. Appeal No. EA/2014/0235 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice FS50532420 Dated 25th June 2014 BETWEEN JV Appellant And The Information Commissioner 1st Respondent And The Department for Work and Pensions 2nd Respondent Determined on the papers at Field House on 17th March 2015 Date of Decision 31st March 2015 BEFORE Fiona Henderson (Judge) Anne Chafer And Gareth Jones Subject matter: s 44 FOIA prohibition of disclosure by or under any enactment (S123(1) Social Security Administration Act 1992 and S50 Child Support Act 1991) Decision: The Appeal is Refused 1REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This appeal is against the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice dated 25th June 2014 which held that the Department for Work and Pensions correctly applied s44 FOIA1. 2. The Child Support Agency (the Agency) is the operating arm of the DWP that deals with calculation and in some cases collection and enforcement of child support maintenance. Where the non-resident parent (NRP) fails to make the required child support maintenance payments the Agency has collection and enforcement powers. One such method of enforcement is a charging order over the property of the NRP which may be enforced by an order for sale. The Appellant made a complaint that the CSA had mishandled her claim for child support resulting in the NRP escaping the consequences of a charging order and an order for sale relating to his property. The Appellant’s information request related to the sale by the NRP of this property. Information Request 3. The Appellant wrote to the DWP on 6th September 2014 asking for: i) Copies of the letters sent to the [Agency] by the purchasers’ solicitors relating to the sale/removal of the restriction. ii) Copies of the letters sent to the [Agency] by the vendor’s solicitors regarding the sale/restriction. iii) Details of the solicitors employed by the [Agency] in relation to the Order for Sale Application iv) Copies of the letters sent by the [Agency] to the vendor’s and purchasers’ solicitors v) Copies of any correspondence sent by the [Agency] to the Land Registry regarding the Order for Sale/removal of the restriction. vi) Copies of the documents on my file relating to the steps taken by the [Agency] to enforce the order for sale after it was granted. 1 prohibition of disclosure by or under any enactment 2vii) Contact details for both the vendor’s and purchasers’ solicitors. 4. The DWP responded on 28th November 2013 answering request iii) but withholding the remainder of the information under s40 FOIA (personal data) this was upheld on internal review. Complaint to the Commissioner 5. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who conducted an investigation, the information requested in (iii) having been provided, the Commissioner’s decision related to the remaining requests (i)-(ii) and (iv)-(vii). In their letter of 9th May 2014 to the Commissioner provided during the investigation, the DWP indicated that the details of and correspondence with the purchaser’s solicitors were not held. They were also relying upon s44 FOIA (prohibition of disclosure by or under any enactment in reliance upon s123(1) Social Security Administration Act 1992) (SSAA). The Commissioner upheld the refusal to provide the information on that basis. The Appeal 6. The Appellant appealed on 22nd September on the grounds that: i. The Commissioner’s decision does not pinpoint why the disclosing party would not possess “lawful authority”. ii. She has already been provided with some of the information. iii. The decision is contrary to the purpose of s123(1) SSAA and iv. Non disclosure is contrary to the overriding objective behind CPR part 31. Additional grounds were argued in the Appellant’s response to the Respondent’s replies: v. the public interest favours disclosure vi. the information is not “acquired” as it is generated by the DWP or supplied by the Appellant, vii. disclosure to her would be lawful because she is an interested party. 3viii. she has had insufficient information given to her under the CSIR 2008. ix. lawful authority is provided for under s 123(9) SSAA. x. SSAA does not apply as she is not asking for social security information xi. disclosure under FOIA would provide lawful authority xii. the appellant is not asking for personal information, and it could be redacted xiii a public interest test is imported through the law of confidence. 7. The DWP were joined by the Tribunal and opposed the appeal relying upon s40 and s44 FOIA. In addition to the absolute prohibition of s123(1) SSAA they further rely upon s50 of the Child Support Act 1991 (CSA) which includes a similar prohibition applicable to those employed as a civil servant in connection with the carrying out of any functions under this Act. The Tribunal is satisfied that the arguments relating to the CSA are identical to those relating to SSAA and does not deal with them separately in light of its findings relating to SSAA. 8. All parties indicated that they were content for the case to be determined upon the papers. The Tribunal is satisfied under rule 32(1)(b) of the GRC rules that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing. A bundle has been provided and all parties have had the opportunity to make submissions in writing. The Tribunal was not provided with a closed bundle and does not consider it necessary to view the withheld material in order to determine this appeal. Scope 9. The Appellant complains that the DWP’s reply is factually inaccurate in that it suggests that the Independent Case Examiner (ICE) investigation is concluded, whereas the Appellant has not accepted the ICE’s findings and the matter is still under investigation. The Tribunal is satisfied that this is not material to the decision as it does not impact upon whether s44 FOIA is engaged or not, it is not a basis to overturn the decision under s58 FOIA. Additionally the Appellant has raised the Commissioner’s Mission statement to “uphold information rights in the public interest” and she details numerous public interest arguments relating to transparency and accountability however, there is no opportunity for the Tribunal to take these into consideration because pursuant to s2(a) FOIA there is no public interest test for absolute exemptions and s2(3)(h) FOIA designates s44 FOIA as absolute. 410. S44 FOIA is the primary argument which we are satisfied applies to all the requested information, consequently there is no need for us to consider s40 FOIA separately and we therefore do not. Prohibition of disclosure by or under any enactment 11. S44 states: (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it- (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment...”. (2) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) fall within .... [paragraph] (a)... 12. The prohibition relied upon is found at s123 SSAA 1992 which states: (1) A person who is or has been employed in social security administration or adjudication is guilty of an offence if he discloses without lawful authority any information which he acquired2 in the course of his employment and which relates to a particular person... s123(5) sets the penalties of imprisonment, a fine or both following conviction. Neither Confirm nor deny 13. The Commissioner in his decision notice held that the proper application of s44 would be neither to confirm nor to deny that the information was held pursuant to s44(2) FOIA because confirming that information is or is not held would confirm whether certain types of information exist and this is itself information acquired in the course of the employment and in the context of the terms of the information request it would relate to a particular person. For the reasons set out below we agree that this section is engaged and that the appropriate response would be to have relied upon s44(2) FOIA. 14. We make the observation that the original response in which s40 FOIA was relied upon and the provision of the summary at p73-77 of the open bundle would appear 2 Emphasis added 5therefore to be contrary to the neither confirm nor deny response, however, as set out below this is not a basis for holding that further information should be disclosed pursuant to FOIA. Is s123 SSAA engaged? 15. The DWP argues and the Tribunal accepts: i. That the Agency is part of the DWP and the DWP’s employees are “employed in social security administration or adjudication” by virtue of Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the SSAA. ii. The information requested would be information acquired in the course of employment. 16. It is argued by the Appellant that some of the information is not acquired as it has been generated by the DWP (e.g. letters written in pursuit of the Appellant’s claim for child support) however, the right to disclosure under FOIA relates to information not documents. We are satisfied that the information contained within the documents (whether generated or received) has been acquired by the employees in the course of the exercise of the Agency’s functions otherwise they would not know to whom to write and about what (e.g. who are the parties and their representatives, the address of the property, the sums involved, the timescales involved and the legal parameters applicable). Consequently we are satisfied that the information is acquired. 17. We are also satisfied that it relates to a particular person (namely the NRP) as it arises out of the sale of his property and his associated CSA liabilities. Lawful Authority 18. The Tribunal has gone on to consider whether there is lawful authority for disclosure under FOIA. The Appellant argues that disclosure to her would be lawful because she is an interested party. Disclosure is to the world at large (i.e. any or all members of the public) and not specifically the Appellant as an interested party consequently the fact that she is an interested party is immaterial under FOIA. 19. The Appellant’s arguments rely upon the information with which she has already been supplied in support of her contention that it would be lawful to provide the information in response to her request ( if not the existing disclosure would be unlawful). The Tribunal observes that even if she had had information disclosed to 6her in breach of the prohibition that would not provide a basis in law for an additional breach by disclosure of further information contrary to the prohibition. 20. The DWP point to the Child Support Information Regulations (CSIR 2008) which allow for disclosure of information relating to one party to a maintenance calculation to another party to that calculation where in the opinion of the Secretary of State such information is essential to inform the party to whom it would be given as to specified factors relating to the calculation3 and its application including: Regulation 13(1)(g) - why a decision has been made not to enforce, or to cease to enforce, under the 1991 Act the amount due under a maintenance calculation. 21. The Appellant argues that she has not been provided with sufficient information to pursue her complaint, and she sets out her dissatisfaction with the conduct and investigation of the Agency. Whilst we share her concerns about the apparent inaction of the Agency when notified of the impending sale prior to completion, we have no jurisdiction to adjudicate on this point and it being limited to her personal interest it is not a factor we can take into consideration under FOIA. 22. She argues that she has supplied some of the information to the Agency, so how can it be unlawful to disclose it to her. The Tribunal notes that s123 SSAA does not specify how the information should be acquired and we are satisfied that it would include information supplied as well as information generated e.g. by calculation. The fact that the information was supplied by the information requestor does not make it lawful to then disclose the information to the general public under FOIA. 23. The Appellant maintains that lawful authority is provided by s 123(9) SSAA which provides; ... disclosure is to be regarded as made with lawful authority if... made (a) in accordance with his official duty – (ii) by a person employed in... the investigation of complaints... The Tribunal does not comment on whether the information requested might be disclosable to the Appellant pursuant to the provision above, because that would be the enforcement of an individual right concerning disclosure to the Appellant alone. 3 Regulation 13 7This Tribunal only has jurisdiction to consider disclosure to the public under FOIA and s123(9)(ii) does not provide lawful authority to disclose the information to the public. 24. The Appellant argues that she is not asking for social security information so s123 SSAA ought not to be applicable. As set out above the prohibition is wide and not limited to social security information, it applies to all information acquired by a relevant employee in the course of their employment. 25. The Appellant suggests that disclosure under FOIA would provide lawful authority to enable disclosure notwithstanding s123 SSAA. She states that if the Tribunal made an order that the Agency is obliged to disclose copies of its correspondence, there could be no question of them being guilty of an offence as the order itself would provide “lawful authority”. We are satisfied that disclosure under FOIA cannot trump a prohibition in another enactment and this is specified in the terms of s44 FOIA which specifically refers to the exemption applying if there is a prohibition on disclosure “otherwise than under this Act”. 26. The Appellant states that she is not asking for personal information. The terms of s123 SSAA do not limit the information to personal information as long as it “relates” to a particular person, as set out above we are satisfied that it does since the subject matter is the NRP’s sale of the property. She suggests that disclosure could be made in redacted format. The terms of s123 SSAA do not require the person to whom the information relates to be identifiable by others, merely that the information disclosed must relate to a particular person. The information would still relate to that person even if they weren’t named in the disclosure. 27. Disclosure under FOIA is a different process to disclosure pursuant to other legal procedures e.g. the CPR. The Tribunal would be exceeding its remit if it were to determine what disclosure would be appropriate in other jurisdictions. 28. The Appellant maintains that a public interest test is imported into consideration of this exemption because “the law of confidence recognises that a breach of confidence may not be actionable when there is an overriding public interest in disclosure”. The law of confidence is a common law right which exists separately from a statutory prohibition. The DWP are not relying upon the law of confidence but a statutory prohibition to which the case law on confidence does not apply. 8The Appellant’s Own Personal Data 27. The DWP originally relied upon s40(1) FOIA4 (personal data of which the requestor is the data subject) in relation to request (vi), in so doing they ignored the fact that the original request was made under FOIA and the DPA. Although the internal review of 1st April 2014 told the Appellant that she was entitled to make a SAR upon payment of £10, it was not acknowledged then or before that the terms of her original request were under the Data Protection Act. We understand that the Appellant’s motives for making the FOIA request were to obtain information to enable her to understand the situation better and to inform her complaint. We cannot comment upon what disclosure she might get pursuant to a SAR since this appeal is under FOIA and we have no jurisdiction to consider what should have been provided under DPA. Conclusion 28. For the reasons set out above we refuse the appeal and uphold the decision notice. Our decision is unanimous. Dated this 31st day of March 2015 Fiona Henderson Tribunal Judge 4 Before the Commissioner the DWP relooked at this element of the request and determined that it fell under s40(2) as it related to the NRP’s personal information. 9"

DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 27 August 2014 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. The Appellant was concerned about the fitness to practise of two named nurses who had been involved in the care of his partner. 2. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) considered the issues he raised and told him that no case to answer had been found against the nurses. 3. On being informed of that he asked the NMC, on 12 January 2014, for ….all the information which made up the process. Specifically you make reference to evidence which I am not clear I have seen including that of the other witnesses. 4. On 20 February 2014 the NMC responded. It refused to confirm or deny (NCND) whether it held the requested information under s.40 (5) (b) FOIA on -2-the basis that to confirm the information was held would, in itself, disclose personal data in breach of the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998. 5. The Appellant believed that there was a strong public interest in disclosing the information because of child safety and protection issues and complained to the Information Commissioner. 6. The Information Commissioner concluded that s.40 (5) applied and that the NMC did not have to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held. 7. The identity of the Appellant, his family, the nurses involved, the hospital and its location are not disclosed in this decision following the agreement of all the parties at the oral appeal hearing. 8. The Appellant explained to the Tribunal in detail the background and history that had led to his FOIA complaint. None of that is covered in this decision because such details could lead to “jigsaw identification” and destroy the purpose of anonymisation. Preliminary Issues at the Oral Hearing 9. The Appellant sought an adjournment at the oral hearing on the basis that the bundle of documents prepared for the Tribunal’s and the parties did not reflect all the information he believed should have been included and also that there had been late service of a witness statement in relation to the NMC’s presentation of its case. 10. The Chamber President, Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane, had reviewed matters ahead of the oral hearing – particularly in relation to representations made by the Appellant on these topics – in a Case Management Note dated 29 January 2015. 11. He had noted that it would be for the Tribunal at the hearing to keep in mind the requirements of procedural fairness. -3-12. Having heard all the parties present at the oral appeal on the application for the adjournment the Tribunal retired and considered the matter for 45 minutes. 13. It declined to grant the adjournment on the basis that it was fair, just and proportionate to continue with the hearing. 14. This was because the matter was finally balanced but the focus of the appeal was narrow and limited. The Appellant was appearing as a litigant in person but he was also professionally qualified and the Tribunal was satisfied that it would be able to ensure that he could participate fully in the proceedings. 15. The Tribunal, in refusing the adjournment, was also conscious of avoiding delay so far as was compatible with proper consideration of the issues given that the NMC was represented by leading counsel whose availability for an adjourned hearing might well add further time before any final adjudication. The Law 16. Section 40 FOIA states: Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or -4-(ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (4) The second condition is that by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(c) of that Act (data subject’s right of access to personal data). (5) The duty to confirm or deny— (a) does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b) does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 or would do so if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of that Act were disregarded, or (ii) by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(a) of that Act (data subject’s right to be informed whether personal data being processed). 17. It is section 40 (5) (b) (i) – italicised immediately above – on which the NMC relies. Oral Evidence 18. The Tribunal heard oral evidence – on which he was cross-examined – from Mr John Lucarroti, the Head of Fitness to Practice Policy and Legislation at the NMC. He adopted his written witness statement dated 23 January 2015. 19. He provided a brief background on the NMC, his role within the NMC, the NMC’s fitness to practice policies and procedures and commented on what -5-he believed would be the adverse impact on the NMC and its registrants of this appeal succeeding. 20. In relation to the latter he maintained, in cross-examination, that the appeal raised the key issue which was importance both to the NMC and to other professional disciplinary bodies more generally. The NMC – and other regulators – had a duty to treat its registrants fairly by conducting the initial stages of investigations in private and maintaining that privacy when assessing requests for information by those such as the Appellant. 21. The NMC received numerous requests for information about its fitness to practice investigations from other third parties including journalists. 22. There had been 4860 fitness to practice cases that were closed or concluded between 2013/2014. 1503 cases had been closed on initial screening, 1404 cases had been closed by the Investigating Committee and 1805 cases concluded in the Conduct and Competence committee or the Health Committee. 92 cases had been concluded through voluntary removal and 12 cases of fraudulent or incorrect entry on a register were concluded. 23. In his experience a sizeable number of complaints which reached the Investigating Committee had no evidential basis and were potentially defamatory in nature. If they had been made public at an early stage they would have had the potential to cause significant reputational harm to the registrants. 24. So as to support the authority and credibility of its investigation process, the NMC required the capacity to reject requests for information where an investigation was ongoing or if it had been closed at an early stage. 25. Any removal of that option would undermine the integrity and efficacy of the NMC’s investigation procedures. That could prove damaging for all parties including registrants, complainants and the public. -6-The Appellant’s Position 26. In C’s Grounds of Appeal and the submissions – the main points of which are summarised below – he maintains in essence that the Information Commissioner and the NMC have taken an absolutist position because he knows the information he is seeking because it has already been disclosed to him, by other processes, privately. 27. On that basis it would be possible for him to upload the details of the nurses concerned in the case to any website he might create and, in doing so, he would simply be providing factual information about a matter of public importance. 28. Simply because he held the information in a “private” capacity should not prevent the NMC disclosing it to him in the context of this FOIA request. 29. He believed there was a legitimate interest for a member of the public (like him) who had made a complaint to the NMC to understand the process through which and the information on which it had adjudicated in respect of the complaint. The processing of the personal data in question was necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest being pursued by him (as a third party). 30. The information could be obtained by an application for pre-action disclosure in the High Court. In that context he maintained that there was a legitimate interest of a member of the public being encouraged to avoid the High Court legal process with all its complexity and expense by allowing simple disclosure of the information requested under FOIA. 31. He did not believe that the NMC could rely on the Data Protection Act because that simply created a circular argument. Neither the Information Commissioner nor the NMC had identified any other right or freedom which justified their respective positions. -7-32. There had been no consideration of the provisions of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act relating to “fairness” and no analysis of the elements which went to make up the assertion that disclosure would not be “fair”. There seemed to be no balancing of what would be fair as between the interests of disclosure and any interests in non-disclosure. The concept of “fairness” had only been applied to the apparent interests of the registrants (the nurses involved in this case). 33. There needed to be a balance between his interests in having the information made public and the likely consequences to the data subjects of any interference with their legitimate interests. Such interference had to be sufficiently substantial to make disclosure “unwarranted” and, in the context of him knowing privately the information which he did, it was not unwarranted. 34. He had taken High Court action which had succeeded, notwithstanding the Information Commissioner’s assertions that there appeared to be nothing wrong with the decision-making process. 35. Following his High Court action the matters were returned to a differently constituted NMC Investigating Committee. That committee had found there was a case to answer in relation to one allegation against one of the nurses but found no case to answer against the other or on any other allegation. 36. When he then asked for information identical to the request under appeal the NMC had asked the nurse in question/ data subject and provided the information requested. 37. The nurse in question had not taken the position that there was a legitimate interest in non-disclosure and it was clear (to the Appellant) that it was the interests of the NMC rather than those of the data subject which were being addressed in the refusal to confirm or deny his request in this appeal. -8-Conclusion and remedy 38. The question facing the Tribunal in this appeal is straightforward. Would giving the information to a member of the public - in terms of confirming or denying that the information existed - breach this “NCND” provision of FOIA and amount to the processing of personal data in the context of the data protection principles? 39. The Tribunal is satisfied that, to confirm or deny to a member of the public whether it held the requested information, the NMC would inevitably be disclosing publicly that a complaint had been made regarding the fitness to practice of (in this case) two named registrants. That inevitably involves the NMC processing the personal data of those registrants. 40. The NMC would be disclosing something about the contents of the information that it held regarding those individuals. It would be making public an important and significant fact about them. 41. The Appellant maintains that - because he knows the information he was seeking in the information request via another route - the statutory restrictions in relation to NCND, disclosure and data processing create bizarre practical situation which is not properly reflected in the legislation and which should, in effect and in the public interest, be corrected in this appeal. 42. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. Disclosure under FOIA means disclosure to the world in general and involves putting the requested information into the public domain. Even confirming or denying its existence does just the same thing. 43. The fact that the Appellant knows the information is not a “lever” that dis- applies those statutory provisions so that he can “bootstrap” himself into the position he seeks. To say that disclosure under FOIA should be made to him would be to say that disclosure should be made to anyone else making a similar request. That cannot be right. -9-44. If the NMC disclosed to a member of the public – by putting the information into the public domain – the fact that a complaint had been made about two registrants it would clearly breach the first data protection principles. It would be unfair in respect of them and would not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 45. In terms of fairness – and this was covered in detail in Mr Lucarotti’s evidence which we accept as both cogent and credible – when a complaint is made to the NMC about a registrant’s fitness to practice than the actual existence of the complaint and its details are not routinely made public. It is only where the NMC’s Investigation Committee decides that there is a case to answer that the existence and details of the complaint are made public. 46. The sequence of the process is that, if it clears the hurdle of the Investigating Committee, it is referred to the Conduct and Competence Committee (which sits in public) or the Health Committee. The Health Committee sits in private because it deals with information about the registrants’ health. That said, notices of both such hearings and decisions are published and the notices and decisions contained the names of the registrants and the detail of the charges together with a detailed decision (with any health information redacted). 47. The Tribunal accepts that the NMC has not made public – at the date of the information request – the fact that complaints had been made against these two individuals. For the NMC to do this would amount to a public and official confirmation that a complaint has been made against them. It would be unfair to them and would contravene their reasonable and legitimate expectations about how their personal information was handled by the NMC. 48. As Mr Lucarotti explained, in his experience a sizeable number of complaints which reach the Investigating Committee had no evidential basis and were potentially defamatory in nature. If they had been made public at an early stage they would have had the potential to cause significant reputational harm to the registrants. - 10 -49. Dealing with Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act, the Tribunal agrees that the only relevant condition in that Schedule is Paragraph 6. That applies when the processing is: necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 50. The Tribunal finds that such disclosure would not be “necessary” for the purposes of any legitimate public interest. Public scrutiny of the NMC’s functions in this area does create a legitimate interest but that does not require that the existence of complaints which have not yet been referred further to be made public. 51. As the NMC points out, any legitimate interest can be met by way of the Judicial Review process – as it was in the present case – and that allowed an individual with a sufficient interest successfully to challenge the NMC’s decisions regarding the handling of fitness to practice complaints. 52. For similar reasons, such disclosure would be “unwarranted” because of the prejudice to the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the two registrants (who are also the data subjects and to whom the request relates). 53. The Tribunal was referred to – and has considered the effect of – all the existing case law. It finds, against that background, in the present case at the time of the request there was nothing in the public domain to indicate whether or not the requested information existed or was held by the NMC. 54. Specifically, the NMC itself had not publicly disclosed whether the relevant information existed or was held, no other personal body had disclosed such information, the Appellant’s complaint to the Ombudsman about the two registrants had been made before his complaint to the NMC and had not resulted in that complaint been made public, the Appellant’s application for Judicial Review was dealt with without a hearing and did not result in the - 11 -existence of his complaint about the two registrants being made public and the information disclosed to him in those proceedings was not put into the public domain. 55. For all these reasons the Tribunal is satisfied that the NMC correctly relied on the provisions of section 40 (5) FOIA and that this appeal must fail. 56. Our decision is unanimous. 57. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 11 March 2015 - 12 -"

DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal allows the appeal from the decision notice dated 15 July 2014 and substitutes the Decision Notice below. SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated 9 MARCH 2015 Public authority: THE LEGAL AID AGENCY (MoJ) Name of Complainant: MR AHMED HERSI The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Tribunal allows the appeal and substitutes the following decision notice in place of the decision notice dated 15 July 2014 for the reasons set out in its decision below. Action Required: Within 31 days the Legal Aid Agency must issue Mr Ahmed Hersi with a refusal notice in accordance with section 17 (5) FOIA explaining why it was relying on section 14 FOIA in refusing the relevant requests. Robin Callender Smith Judge 9 March 2015 -2-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Mr Ahmed Hersi (the Appellant) wanted information from the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) relating to a tender bid process in 2010 for legal aid work. The LAA is an executive agency responsible to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). 2. The Appellant is a solicitor whose law practice was part of a tender bid in 2010 for legal aid work. The firm launched judicial review proceedings against the LAA which is ongoing. 3. The Agency had previously refused a request for information on the same subject matter under section 14 (1) and that had been held to be a correct application of that section of FOIA as expressed in a subsequent Decision Notice. 4. The Agency had provided a notice on 20 May 2013 informing the Appellant that it would not respond to further requests on the same subject matter on the basis of section 17 (6) FOIA. The Appellant’s second request was a resubmission of an earlier request in 2011. 5. At the time of the Information Commissioner’s initial suggestion in April 2013 that the Appellant resubmitted the 2011 request there had been no finding that the Appellant’s subsequent request would be refused as vexatious. 6. His second request was not made until sometime after the notice given under section 17 (6) after finding by the Information Commissioner in the second decision notice. 7. The two information requests in relation to this appeal both related to the tender process and proceedings which were the subject of the section 17 (6) notice. -3-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 8. The Agency had warned the Appellant that it would not respond to further requests and, by virtue of section 17 (6), it maintained it had not acted unreasonably in refusing to do so. 9. The Information Commissioner had previously found an earlier request on the same subject to be vexatious and the Agency could not revisit that request (the second Decision Notice) in the context of the present requests. 10. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Agency had appropriately relied on section 17 (6) in not responding to the requests. The Appellant’s view of the background 11. Looked at through from the perspective of the Appellant, the background elements for the request were summarised by his Counsel, Mr Bunting, at the oral hearing were as follows: (1) The Appellant had brought judicial review proceedings against the rejection of his tender bid. As explained in that claim, the LAA assessed his application for a contract to provide publicly funded immigration services in the 2010 tender round on an incorrect factual basis, failed to take adequate steps to clarify his tender application, and breached the public law principle of equality of treatment. The judicial review claim sought an award of damages to reflect the Appellant’s loss of income estimated in the region of £4,413,685.71. (2) Neither of the Respondents had suggested that the Appellant’s judicial review claim was unarguable. It was a central aspect of the Appellant’s judicial review claim that the Legal Aid Agency had treated his application for a tender differently to the manner in which it treated other firms. In related judicial review claims brought by other firms in respect of the 2010 tender round, the Legal Aid Agency has been found to have provided inconsistent evidence (see the summary of the -4-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 evidence in R (AAR) v Legal Services Commission [2011] EWHC 964 (Admin), at [156-157]) and has been required to apologise “ unreservedly” for misleading disclosure. (3) The Appellant had therefore made a number of requests to the Legal Aid Agency for information, pursuant to s.1 Freedom of Information Act 2000. The schedule of requests provided by the LAA in this appeal was not an accurate summary of the Appellant’s requests under section 1 FOIA as its schedule also included decisions of the Commissioner and other correspondence. The Issue in the Appeal 12. The former General Regulatory Chamber President, Upper Tribunal Judge NJ Warren, crystallised the issue to be considered in this appeal in a case management note dated 26 August 2014. He noted This appeal appears to raise a question concerning the construction of Section 17 (6) FOIA. That question is whether, for Section 17 (6) to apply, the public authority must first be satisfied that Section 17 (6) (a) applies to the instant request. Put another way, does Section 17 (6) absolve the authority from the duty to provide information under Section 1? Or does it merely absolve the authority from its duty to give notice under Section 17? 13. The Tribunal notes this issue of statutory construction in relation to section 17 (6) – in this context - does not appear to have come before the Information Rights Tribunal before. 14. The authorities to which we were referred were BBC v Sugar and another [2009] 1 WLR, in particular, Lord Phillips observation that Section 17 imposes requirements as to the explanation that must be given by a public authority to the maker of a request for information when the public authority claim that information is exempt information or exercises a right to decline to “confirm or deny”. We were also referred to Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and, in particular (at Paragraph 27), the observation that FOIA is a “statute designed to ensure greater public -5-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 access to official information and to increase accountability and transparency”. 15. We also considered an observations in Information Rights Law and Practice The FOIA s. 17 (6) (b) refers to a previous notice that the public authority is relying on a claim that s. 14 applies and not just a previous notice that the public authority is relying on a claim that a request was vexatious. Accordingly it would seem that a public authority is entitled to rely upon the provisions of s.17 (6) where it has previously served either a notice that a request is vexatious or notice that a request is a repeat request. The Scottish provisions are slightly more restrictive, in that the public authority is only excused from giving a notice if it has previously given notice in respect of an identical or substantially similar request: FOIA(S)A s. 16 (5) (a). 1 The Law 16. In relation to the refusal of the request, Section 17 states (with s.17 (6) italicised): (1) A public authority which, in relation to any request for information, is to any extent relying on a claim that any provision of Part II relating to the duty to confirm or deny is relevant to the request or on a claim that information is exempt information must, within the time for complying with section 1(1), give the applicant a notice which— (a) states that fact, (b) specifies the exemption in question, and (c) states (if that would not otherwise be apparent) why the exemption applies. (2) Where— (a) in relation to any request for information, a public authority is, as respects any information, relying on a claim— (i) that any provision of Part II which relates to the duty to confirm or deny and is not specified in section 2(3) is relevant to the request, or (ii) that the information is exempt information only by virtue of a provision not specified in section 2(3), and (b) at the time when the notice under subsection (1) is given to the applicant, the public authority (or, in a case falling within section 66(3) or (4), the responsible authority) has not yet reached a decision as to the application of subsection (1)(b) or (2)(b) of section 2, the notice under subsection (1) must indicate that no decision as to the application of that provision has yet been reached and must contain 1 Philip Copell QC Information Rights Law and Practice 4 Edn Hart 2014 459 (footnote 38). -6-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 an estimate of the date by which the authority expects that such a decision will have been reached. (3) A public authority which, in relation to any request for information, is to any extent relying on a claim that subsection (1)(b) or (2)(b) of section 2 applies must, either in the notice under subsection (1) or in a separate notice given within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances, state the reasons for claiming— (a) that, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the authority holds the information, or (b) that, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (4) A public authority is not obliged to make a statement under subsection (1)(c) or (3) if, or to the extent that, the statement would involve the disclosure of information which would itself be exempt information. (5) A public authority which, in relation to any request for information, is relying on a claim that section 12 or 14 applies must, within the time for complying with section 1(1), give the applicant a notice stating that fact. (6) Subsection (5) does not apply where— (a) the public authority is relying on a claim that section 14 applies, (b) the authority has given the applicant a notice, in relation to a previous request for information, stating that it is relying on such a claim, and (c) it would in all the circumstances be unreasonable to expect the authority to serve a further notice under subsection (5) in relation to the current request. (7) A notice under subsection (1), (3) or (5) must— (a) contain particulars of any procedure provided by the public authority for dealing with complaints about the handling of requests for information or state that the authority does not provide such a procedure, and (b) contain particulars of the right conferred by section 50. The LAA’s Submission 17. The LAA noted that Section 1(1) of FOIA conferred rights of access to information held by public authorities. Section 1(2) indicates that those rights are qualified (for instance they are subject to the substantive exemptions under Part II of FOIA). 18. The Part II exemptions relate to the nature of the requested information. Where a public authority relied upon Part II exemptions in refusing to -7-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 disclose requested information, it was required to provide the requester with a written notice under section 17 FOIA explaining the basis for the refusal. 19. FOIA also contains certain provisions which are concerned not with the nature of the requested information as such, but rather with the impact of the request upon the public authority (and thus the public purse). Those provisions are designed to ensure that public authorities are not placed under unacceptable levels of burden in responding to FOIA request. 20. One such provision is section 12, which is concerned with specified aspects of the cost of complying with a request. Another provision which, in part, seeks to guard against unacceptable burdens is section 14 (vexatious or repeated requests), which provided as follows: (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious. (2) Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for information which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request. 21. In Dransfield, the Upper Tribunal found that one of the key considerations in determining whether section 14 applies is the burden imposed by the request, viewed in context, i.e. viewed in terms of previous related requests and correspondence. Other key considerations are the motive and purpose/value of the request, and any harassing or distressing effects of the requester’s correspondence (including the request at issue). These considerations are reflected in the Commissioner’s guidance on section 14 FOIA. 22. There was a separate requirement under section 17 FOIA for a public authority which was relying on one of the burden-related provisions to notify the requestor in writing that it is doing so. In particular, section 17(5) states: -8-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 (5) A public authority which, in relation to any request for information, is relying on a claim that section 12 or 14 applies must, within the time for complying with section 1(1), give the applicant a notice stating that fact. 23. That requirement is dis-applied in section 14 cases, to the following extent – in section 17 (6): (6) Subsection (5) does not apply where— (a) the public authority is relying on a claim that section 14 applies, (b) the authority has given the applicant a notice, in relation to a previous request for information, stating that it is relying on such a claim, and (c) it would in all the circumstances be unreasonable to expect the authority to serve a further notice under subsection (5) in relation to the current request. 24. The LAA submitted that it was clear why the ‘refusal notice’ duty is dis- applied for follow-up section 14 requests. This is because section 14 FOIA is aimed in part at preventing public authorities from incurring the burden of dealing with vexatious or repeated requests. Part of that burden arises from the duty to provide a refusal notice under section 17. 25. Section 17(6) allows public authorities to draw an “enough is enough” line so that, where appropriate, they do not have to keep on responding to requests which form part of a series of vexatious or repeated requests. 26. The LAA maintained that is exactly what has happened to the Appellant. The LAA had previously issued Mr Hersi with a refusal notice under section 17(5) explaining that section 14 was being relied upon and that future requests on the same issues would not be responded to. Mr Hersi complained to the Commissioner about the LAA’s application of section 14. The Commissioner issued a decision notice in the LAA’s favour. That decision notice was not challenged on appeal. In the circumstances, it would have been unreasonable for the LAA to have to issue another section 17(5) refusal notice in response to the relevant requests, which were on the same issues as those covered by previous requests. 27. Were the conditions under section 17(6) met in respect of the relevant requests? In the LAA’s submission, it is clear that they were because -9-Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 a) The LAA was clearly “relying on a claim that section 14 applies” to the relevant requests. Contrary to Mr Hersi’s submission, limb (a) of section 17(6) is not about whether section 14 was properly engaged (which is a question of judgment and analysis). Rather, it is about whether or not the public authority was relying on a claim that section 14 applied (which is a question of fact). There is no basis whatsoever for concluding that, in respect of the relevant requests, the LAA was doing anything other than relying on a claim that section 14 applied. This was obvious on any reasonable standard. b) As explained above, the LAA had given Mr Hersi a notice in response to previous requests explaining very clearly that it was relying on section 14, and that future requests relating to the same issues would not be responded to. c) In all the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect the LAA to issue a further section 17(5) refusal notice in response to the relevant requests. (d) It should also be noted that, on 21 February 2014 (which post- dated the relevant requests), the LAA received yet another repeat of the same requests which had already been dealt with. This time, they were made not by Mr Hersi directly, but by someone else acting for him. The LAA considered that, in the circumstances, the duty under section 17(5) did not arise in respect of the 21 February request either. However, given that this requests was not submitted directly by Mr Hersi, the LAA decided to explain its position in writing. The LAA considered that it did not have to take that step. It was simply trying to be helpful to the submitter of that particular request. That in no way detracted from the LAA’s position in respect of the relevant requests. On the contrary, it showed that the LAA sought to assist where it was reasonable to do so. 28. In respect of the relevant requests themselves, however, the LAA was entitled to take the view that “enough is enough” in terms of requests from Mr Hersi on the same issues which had already been addressed. It would have been unreasonable to expect the LAA to engage further with such requests from Mr Hersi. The core of the Appellant’s submission 29. At the core of the Appellant’s submission is the proposition that, at its height, section 17 (6) acts as a limited exception to the requirements set out at section 17 (5). It does not set out an exception to section 1 (1) of FOIA. - 10 -Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 30. To interpret section 17 (6) more widely would not only be contrary to the purposes of FOIA but would “drive a coach and horses” through section 14 as interpreted in Dransfield. Section 14 applied to a request and not to a requestor. Simply because a single request is deemed to be vexatious that should not give a licensed public authorities to use section 14 as a “means of forestalling genuine attempts to hold them to account”. 31. Unless section 14 applied then any public authority must comply with section 1 (1). If a public authority seeks to rely on section 14 it must provide a notice to the requestor by virtue of section 17 (5). If in complaint about a failure to comply with section 1 (1), the public authority must still satisfy the Information Commissioner that section 14 applies. 32. The Information Commissioner erred in law in failing to consider whether the LAA had properly complied with section 1 (1). In this case that meant considering whether section 14 applied in this case. At best, the LAA had suggested that it was “relying on a claim that section 14 applied”. Conclusion and remedy 33. It appears to the Tribunal that it is possible to construct scenarios where - for a public authority to refuse to respond to an information request from a previously identified requestor by relying on section 17 (6) - would be to rely on that sub-section unlawfully and unreasonably. 34. Such a scenario would occur if Mr Hersi’s request to the LAA (and the MoJ) related to something other than the actual topics that did occupy his requests and – despite that - the public authority deemed these other requests as falling under the shadow of the existing section 17 (6) notice and refusal. 35. That would be personalising and refusing what could be completely legitimate information requests in a manner in which neither section 17 nor section14 permits by characterising them as being the product of a particular individual requestor rather than as a particular information - 11 -Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 request (which may or may not have a context or topic that may or may not make it one which is repeated or vexatious). 36. That would be tantamount to using section 17 (6) as a block to prevent a particular requestor from ever having any further information request considered. 37. It must logically be a requirement for section 17 (6) to operate that the public authority has to be able to demonstrate that it has undertaken an assessment that the current request does in fact relate to the topic or topics which formed the subject of the previous, vexatious request. 38. Without that assessment, it is not clear how the public authority can demonstrate that it is not using section 17(6) as a block to all further information requests from that requestor. Nor is it clear how the public authority can demonstrate that it is relying on a claim that section 14 applied. 39. This is not to argue that such an assessment needs to be extensive or that the public authority needs to inform the requestor that it has undertaken that assessment. That would render section 17(6) redundant. But it does have to do something – even if it is just a file note which could then have been part of proceedings such as these - in order for the phrase ‘relying on a claim’ to mean anything. 40. In this case, the LAA proffered no evidence that it had undertaken any form of assessment. The ICO made no attempt to establish whether the LAA had made any assessment. It was therefore left to the Tribunal to infer whether the LAA had correctly used section 17(6). 41. Although it is possible for the Tribunal to compare the former vexatious request with the current request, this does not assist in understanding whether the LAA at the time of the request was relying on a claim that section 14 applied. That exercise in comparison is one the LAA should have undertaken. - 12 -Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 42. The alternative – and one we reject - is to allow what happened in the background facts that led to this appeal to permit what amounts to a carte blanche section 17 (b) refusal. 43. The Appellant is a repeated requestor on a narrow and specific topic. The background for this has been set out in some detail at the beginning of this decision. The requests were about a particular tender for a legal services contract which was awarded to a named firm. There is a history to these requests and correspondence on the same issue. There is a Decision Notice (FS50505670) - issued by the Information Commissioner on 18 December 2013 which was also about requests from the Appellant for information about the same tender – which substantially upheld a section 14 refusal and which was not challenged on appeal. He had been reminded in that Decision Notice that the LAA had told him it would not be responding to future FOIA requests on the same or related issues. 44. The LAA has relied on a claim that section 14 applies and then it has given him notice – in response to other earlier requests – which explains very clearly that it was relying on section 14 and that future requests relating to the same issues would not be responded to. 45. Our view is that it is completely lawful, reasonable and proportionate for the LAA to be required to demonstrate that it applied its mind to the actual substance of this request before jumping to the section 17 (6) “block”. 46. We are not satisfied that this important step is evidenced here. It is not enough for the LAA to say, without further ado, that “enough is enough” and to apply section 17 (6) simply because the request is from this Appellant. 47. For all these reasons we find that the Appellant’s appeal succeeds. 48. The Tribunal substitutes the Decision Notice in the terms stated at the beginning of this decision. 49. Our decision is unanimous. - 13 -Appeal No. EA/2014/0206 50. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 9 March 2015 - 14 -"

Dated this 19th. day of February, 2015 David Farrer Q.C. Judge [Signed on original] The Decision Introduction 1. MSH is a general practitioner practising within Heywood, Middleton and Roch- dale PCT (“HMRPCT”). 2. On three occasions, the last in about 2008, he has been referred by HMRPCT to the GMC for investigation of his fitness to practise. MSH, in reply, submitted to the GMC a series of serious complaints regarding the doctors in- 2volved in the referrals, evidently on the basis that, if such complaints were sus- tained, their evidence of his alleged unfitness would be undermined or wholly discredited. The resulting investigations involved a temporary suspension of MSH in advance of any finding. They were all concluded by GMC examiners with the assistance of an expert’s report. This Tribunal is not concerned with the nature of the allegations involved nor are the examiners’ findings material to the issues in this appeal. 3. MSH was dissatisfied with the GMC’s handling of the referrals and corre- sponded with GMC officers from about 2009 and continued until after the re- quests with which this appeal is concerned. He accused the GMC, expressly or by clear implication, of racial, religious and age - related discrimination. 4. His complaints as to the GMC’s handling of his case were reviewed by the GMC’s external legal examiners. Significant delays followed, as the GMC ac- knowledged. Following the examiners’ report to the GMC, Christine Couchman, Head of the Deputy Chief Executive’s office and Corporate Complaints Man- ager, wrote a very detailed letter to MSH dated 29th. February, 2012 in which she expressed her satisfaction that the external examiners, in reviewing both the handling of the clinical complaints against MSH and his complaints as to the conduct and motivation of those responsible for the referrals, had acted fairly and impartially and applied the appropriate test as to conducting further investi- gations. She, as the responsible officer of the GMC, was satisfied that MSH had not been the victim of discrimination on the ground of race, religion, age or any other deliberate injustice. 5. Ms. Couchman’s expressed hope that her definitive analysis of the issues and the GMC’s conclusions would bring the prolific correspondence to an end was not fulfilled. MSH then wrote a large number of letters to the GMC Chair, Council members and officers which were logged and attached later to a letter from the GMC to the ICO dated 18th. July, 2014, responding to his inquiries into MSH’s 3complaint (see paragraph 10). Those letters raised with a wide range of senior GMC figures the complaints which arose from the referrals. 6. Additionally, MSH made a series of FOIA requests, four in 2012 and eight in 2013, largely relating to the racial origins and religion of doctors referred to the GMC by PCTs. He also made requests under the Data Protection Act 1998 (""DPA""). The last FOIA request gives rise to this appeal. The Request 7. By letter of 12th. December, 2013 MSH requested the following information from the GMC - 1 Copy of conversation between A of Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale PCT and B of the GMC. 2 Copy of the Advice given by B to A. 3 Job title and job description of B. 4 How many advices B has given to the PCTs in the last ten years about the doctors. 5 Ethnicity of origin and age of those doctors about whom he gave the advices. A and B had featured in the referral procedures in MSH’s case. 8. The GMC acknowledged the request on the same day, stating that the GMC would consider it by reference both to FOIA and the DPA. 9. It provided a substantive response on 30th. January, 2014. As to (1) and (2), it stated that the information requested had been provided on 24th. August, 2012 4in so far as it was his personal data but other data had been redacted. Clearly, MSH’s personal data could not be provided in answer to a FOIA request (s. 40(1)). 10. As to (3) - (5) the GMC treated them as vexatious requests citing s.14(1) of FOIA. MSH sought an internal review on 31st. January, 2014, which was re- fused on 1st. May, 2014, long after the date for a response prescribed by the ICO. The complaint to the ICO 11. MSH did not wait for that refusal but complained to the ICO on 1st. April, 2014. The ICO commenced an investigation which produced in response the GMC letter of 18th. July, 2014, already referred to. The Decision Notice (“the DN”) 12. The ICO had regard to the “holistic” approach recommended in Dransfield and the particular features of the request to which the ICO or the Tribunal would need to have regard. He characterised MSH’s stance as a stubborn refusal to accept that the issues surrounding his complaints had been determined, albeit not as he would have wanted. He considered the requests taken in the context of the previous history burdensome and of very limited value. They were de- signed to disrupt and to retaliate against decisions with which MSH disagreed. He upheld the GMC’s decision to treat requests 3 - 5 as vexatious. The Appeal 13. MSH appealed, stating, in effect, that the ICO’s decision was wrong because he had failed to understand the importance of the information sought in requests 3 - 5. It was essential to the vindication of MSH’s belief that B gave vexatious ad- 5vice to the GMC and might be guilty of racist and discriminatory conduct in his role with the GMC. He contended that the GMC, in collaboration with HMRPCT, was discriminating against and victimising certain doctors on the grounds of age, race and religion. He accused the GMC of supporting a crimi- nal against MSH, one who defrauded MSH and others. (This was a reference to the conviction in June 2013 of one of the complainants against MSH of offences of fraud for which he received suspended sentences of imprisonment.) 14. The ICO related the guidance in Dransfield to the facts of this appeal and sub- mitted that the DN should be upheld. The GMC adopted a similar approach and reminded the Tribunal that it was not concerned with alleged abuses of power by a public authority. The evidence 15. Dr. Humayun gave evidence briefly, repeating his concerns over alleged dis- crimination and the need to resolve his suspicions as to the way that the GMC handled his referrals and similar issues relating in particular to doctors of Paki- stani origin. He relied on a witness statement prepared for proceedings in an Employment Tribunal by A of HMRPCT. It was quite impossible, however, to understand how it assisted his case. He adduced other documentary evidence. Some was submitted late in breach of the Registrar’s directions. We read eve- rything nevertheless but none of it had any bearing on the issue before us - whether requests 3 - 5 were vexatious. 16. Janet Mauldridge, an information access officer at the GMC, gave evidence on its behalf. She related the history of the requests with which this appeal is con- cerned and of the GMC’s previous dealings with MSH. She stated that, by January, 2014, the GMC Information Access Team had dealt with over one hundred individual questions, often repetitive, overlapping and of no obvious value. She described the burden that such correspondence imposed. She ap- 6pended to her statement a schedule of requests made by MSH since January, 2014, most but not all of which had been refused. She was the author of the let- ter of 18th. July, 2014 to the ICO setting out very clearly the GMC’s case and appending two Annexes. Annex A contained correspondence with MSH begin- ning with the important Couchman letter referred to in paragraph 4 and continu- ing to January, 2014. Annex B contained a sequence of requests from MSH and GMC responses, which are further considered at paragraphs 22 and 23. Our Reasons 17. The Tribunal is aware that the Court of Appeal has, as at the date of this Deci- sion, reserved judgment on an appeal from the UT in Dransfield. However, it will not delay delivery of a decision pending that judgment, the date of which is uncertain but will apply the guidance in the UT decision, which is binding upon it unless or until it is overruled. 18. We are concerned only with the treatment of requests 3 - 5 as vexatious, since that is the only decision contained in the DN. We should add, however, that 1 and 2 were clearly subject access requests which cannot be made pursuant to FOIA (see s.40(1)). We understand that the requested information had been substantially provided over a year earlier. 19. As to requests 3, 4 and 5, we have no doubt that, taken in the context of the history of the previous four years’ correspondence, they constituted a clear abuse of the rights conferred by FOIA s.1 and the GMC was fully entitled to treat them as vexatious. In reaching that emphatic conclusion we take account of both the previous FOIA and DPA requests and the related letters and emails in Annex A. That conforms to the “holistic” approach advocated in Dransfield. 720. The long sequence of emails, requests and complaints stems from MSH’s re- fusal or inability to accept that his complaint as to the handling of his case had been fully and independently investigated by external solicitors and that, what- ever his disappointment, the matter could be taken no further, unless he thought that he could challenge their conclusions by way of judicial review. A time comes when further banging on the same door will not bring anyone to open it. Mere repetition of the same points through an endless list of questions will achieve nothing but merely impose a heavy burden on those called upon to answer them. The burden is not just the time and energy required to satisfy an unceasing stream of inquiries but the knowledge that no answer, however de- finitive, will ever halt or even slow it down. 21. So it is necessary to consider not just the volume but the futility of the requests made from 2009 onwards. Furthermore, the Tribunal has to ask itself whether MSH was really interested in the answers or simply asking questions to keep the GMC occupied. It is noteworthy that he was told at an early stage of the cor- respondence that the GMC did not keep records of the race (as distinct from ethnicity) or the religious affiliations of doctors referred; yet he continued to re- quest percentages for Muslim doctors as though quite blind to the GMC re- sponse. 22. We were assisted in our assessment by the provision in Annex B to the GMC’s letter to the ICO of 18th. July 2014, of the exchanges of letters relating to the nineteen requests made by MSH under FOIA and/ or the DPA from April, 2009 to 29th. October, 2013, the immediate predecessor to the requests featured in this appeal. 23. They demonstrate a remorseless repetition, in slightly varying forms, of re- quests that had already been answered or previously identified as requiring in- formation which the GMC did not hold – such as the religion and race of a doc- tor. A single letter of request often contained a long list of wide - ranging and detailed questions often far removed from MSH’s case or any issue of obvious 8public interest. They include inquiries, covering wholly unrelated appeals over a ten - year period, as to - - how expert witness statements were prepared, - the method of selection of expert witnesses; - ages of doctors referred; - how many Jewish doctors were referred; 24. The disproportionate burden on the GMC of this barrage of inquiries would be plain to anyone of MSH’s obvious intelligence and sophistication. The Tribunal concludes that it was in part an expression of anger and disappointment and was designed to harass an authority, which MSH regarded, without a shred of justification on the evidence of this appeal, as unreasonably hostile and biased against him. He evidently took the same view of HMRPCT. 25. The impression made by MSH on the Tribunal, whether testifying or arguing his case, tended to reinforce rather than weaken the sense that he was engaged in a feud rather than legitimately seeking information. Conclusion 26. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 27. Our decision is unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 19th. February, 2015 9"
"64","Procedural Refusal","EA/2014/0217 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL EA/2014/0217 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice dated 9 July 2014 FS50527402 Appellant: Mr H M First Respondent: Information Commissioner Second Respondent: Warwickshire County Council Paper hearing Before John Angel (Judge) and Rosalind Tatam and Narendra Makanji Subject: section 12(1)-(5) FOIA (cost compliance exceeds appropriate limit), regulation 5 Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulation 2004 and section 16 FOIA (duty to provide advice and assistance) Decision The Tribunal dismisses the appeal. 1EA/2014/0217 Reasons for Decision Background 1. In 2013 Warwickshire County Council (WCC) decided to remodel its Integrated Disability Service (IDS), short breaks and social care services to meet recommendations set out in the Children and Families Bill 2013 and to make essential savings from the service budget. WCC decided it had to reduce its budget by nearly £70 million by 2014/15. Its proposed savings target for the IDS was set at £1.7m which would reduce the service’s total budget to £7.1m for the next financial year. 2. The reduction in budget would mainly affect the services provided to disabled children. Not surprisingly this caused great concern in the local community particularly for those parents, carers and professionals who would be affected. Some of parents and carers formed a group called Family Voice Warwickshire (FVW) to press their concerns with WCC about the changes but also with other objectives such as “to provide education, training, information and advice to parents and carers to empower them to advance their children in life and assist with their development”. 3. Some members of FVW requested information from WCC about the cuts. Also it was reported that the organisation had threatened legal action by way of Judicial Review against WCC. 4. In May 2013 WCC started a public consultation inviting people to have a say about redesign proposals for children’s disability services in Warwickshire. It would appear that FVW was invited to take part. The consultation ended in July 2013. 5. On 12 September 2013 the WCC Cabinet decided to confirm the decision to decommission short break services and to dispose of associated capital assets. The Request 6. On 15 October 2013 Mr H M made a request in 13 parts to the WCC (Request). It is set out in paragraph 4 of the Decision Notice dated 9 July 2014 (DN). The actual Request starts “can clarification please be provided on a reply to a previous request submitted by myself/Ruth Walwyn, answer provide by Jessica Nash (12 April 2013)”. 7. Mr H M met with the Leader of WCC on 10 November 2013, presumably to discuss matters raised in his Request. 8. WCC responded on 12 November 2013 and, after aggregating the Request with other FOIA requests (from 11 parents) received after 15 October 2013 it says from members of FVW, the WCC responding to the 2EA/2014/0217 Request claimed that it would exceed the appropriate limit and applied section 12(1) FOIA in order to refuse the Request (the Refusal Notice). Mr H M asked for an internal review. On 23 December 2013 WCC upheld the Refusal Notice. Relevant Legal Framework 9. Section 1 FOIA states in relevant part: “(1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled to- (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. (2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to the following provision of this section and to the provisions of sections 2, 9, 12 and 14.” 10. Section 12 provides in relevant part: “(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit. .. (3) In subsections (1) and (2) “the appropriate limit” means such circumstances as may be prescribed, and different amounts may be prescribed in relation to different cases. .. (5) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the purposes of this section as to the costs to be estimated and as to the manner in which they are to be estimated.” 11. The ‘appropriate limit’ referred to in section 12 FOIA is set out in the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (the Fees Regulations). The Fees Regulations state that the appropriate limit for organisations such as the Council is £450. When calculating the cost estimate the Fees Regulations state that the cost of a request must be calculated at the rate of £25 per hour and they also state what activities may and may not be included in the calculation (regulation 4). If the Council estimates it will take more than 18 hours’ work to comply with the request, it may refuse a request under section 12. 12. In certain circumstances, it is possible to aggregate the costs for complying with two or more requests. Regulation 5 of the Fees Regulations states: 3EA/2014/0217 “(1) In circumstances in which this regulation applies, where two or more requests for information to which section 1(1) of the 2000 Act would, apart from the appropriate limit, to any extent apply, are made to a public authority— (a) by one person, or (b) by different persons who appear to the public authority to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign, the estimated cost of complying with any of the requests is to be taken to be the total costs which may be taken into account by the authority, under regulation 4, of complying with all of them. (2) This regulation applies in circumstances in which– (a) the two or more requests referred to in paragraph (1) relate, to any extent, to the same or similar information, and (b) those requests are received by the public authority within any period of sixty consecutive working days. (3) In this regulation, “working day” means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or a day which is a bank holiday under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 in any part of the United Kingdom.” (Underlining added as emphasis) 13. Section 16 FOIA, which is also relevant to this matter, states: “(1) It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it. (2) Any public authority which, in relation to the provision of advice or assistance in any case, conforms with the code of practice under section 45 [FOIA] is to be taken to comply with the duty imposed by subsection (1) in relation to that case.” 14. Paragraph 14 of the code of practice issued under section 45 FOIA, states: “Where an authority is not obliged to comply with a request for information because, under section 12(1) and regulations made under section 12, the cost of complying would exceed the ""appropriate limit"" (i.e. cost threshold) the authority should consider providing an indication of what, if any, information could be provided within the cost ceiling. The authority should also consider advising the applicant that by reforming or re-focussing their request, information may be able to be supplied for a lower, or no, fee.” 4EA/2014/0217 Grounds of appeal 15. Mr H M first asserts that the Commissioner was wrong to consider that his multi-part request was submitted as part of a campaign by FVW. Mr H M says ‘when I am the only person to contact ICO, I am bemused as to how ICO can consider that my request was part of a campaign’. 16. The Commissioner considers Mr H M may have misunderstood some of the reasoning for the Commissioner’s findings. The Commissioner argues that the relevant issue here is whether there are requests from different persons who appear to the public authority to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign. The application of the Fees Regulations is not contingent on an appeal to the Commissioner under section 50 FOIA; it is of no relevance. 17. We agree with the Commissioner. It is of no relevance that no other requesters complained to the Commissioner. However what we need to consider is whether WCC was entitled to aggregate the requests. 18. Mr H M maintains that he is not linked (other than tangentially) to FVW. 19. The WCC aggregated what would appear to be 12 requests on the basis of information taken from the FVW website at the time referring to the 11 requests which presumably does not include the Request. The Commissioner found that there was evidence “that the complainant’s request did not specifically form part of the organised campaign of the leadership of” FVW. Mr H M says that the first time he met any members of FVW was at a consultation meeting held by WCC on 24 October after the date of the Request and that his Request was not part of any campaign on the part of FVW. 20. Ruth Walwyn was the Chair of FVW. A letter from WCC dated 12 April 2013 was sent by Jessica Nash the Service Manager, Strategic Commissioning SEN on behalf of WCC to Ms Walwyn. Mr H M’s Request appears to have been prompted to some extent by the information contained in that letter. Parts 1-4 of his Request, were prefaced with the phrase ‘… on a reply to a previous request submitted by myself/ Ruth Walwyn, answer provided by Jessica Nash (12 April 2013)’. 21. Mr H M is a parent of a child with autism and learning disability. He says he was never a member of FVW. However he admits that he knew about FVW and had had contact with the organisation because it was “the recognised body of parents and carers to liaise amongst themselves and with WCC”. This is not surprising considering his personal circumstances 5EA/2014/0217 and the measures being taken by WCC in relation to services which would, no doubt, affect his child. 22. Taking into account these circumstances it seems reasonable for the WCC to have assumed that Mr H M is in someway linked to FVW, having named the Chair in his Request and having access to a document sent to Ms Walwyn. 23. Under Regulation 5(1)(b) of the Fees Regulations it is only necessary for WCC to be satisfied that “different persons…appear to the public authority to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign” (our emphasis). From the evidence in this case we consider WCC formed a reasonable view that the different persons making requests within a short period of each other (received by the authority within a period of 60 consecutive days) were made in the circumstances set out in section 12(4)(b) FOIA. The Commissioner at §22 DN found “that it was reasonable for the council to consider that the complainant was acting in concert with the group, and that the request was part of a continuation of that campaign”. 24. Also we note that under Regulation 5 it is not just that the requests must be received within a period of 60 consecutive days but that the requests relate, to any extent, to the same or similar information. This is a wide requirement. As is explained later in the decision we find that this requirement is met. 25. On the evidence before us we agree with the Commissioners findings in §22 DN “whilst the complainant’s individual request may not have been known specifically by the leadership of Family Voice there was a campaign to obtain information by its membership and the complainant’s request was for information on the same sorts of issues with the same overall purposes”. Under Regulation 5 of the Fees Regulations it is only necessary for it to “appear to the public authority” that Mr H M was acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign. In our view WCC reasonably took the view it did. There was no need for it to have actual evidence say that he was a member of FVW. It was sufficient that WCC came to a reasonable conclusion based on the information available to it. 26. Mr H M also challenges the way that WCC concluded that the requests would exceed the appropriate limit. WCC categorised the 12 requests in the Refusal Notice in an interesting way. The Request itself makes 13 individual points. WCC categorised the information that was being requested as follows: a. IDS budget – various questions b. Staff structure and budget c. Analysis of response to consultation 6EA/2014/0217 d. Needs assessment matrix and information regarding number of individuals remaining under Children’s Services under new system e. Grants received from central government and IDS budget f. Cost to Council regarding delay in the implementation of budget cuts g. Sitting service arrangement from ILEAP h. Contracts with external providers i. Calculations of packages and how been reviewed j. IDS fixed assets k. Correspondence between officers in connection with IDS cuts. 27. We have no evidence to explain how WCC arrived at these categories and it is difficult to map these categories above against the 13 parts of Mr H M’s Request. Most of the categories seem unrelated, and his “legal” questions do not seem to form part of any category. It does not appear that the Commissioner made any enquiry as to the categorisation. Neither the Commissioner nor the Tribunal was provided with the substance of the other requests made. However we can identify at least 4 categories which are related to the Request and this is sufficient in our view to meet the requirement under Regulation 5(2)(a). 28. Mr H M is critical of the WCC’s FOI practices particularly in relation to the 10 hours expended on dealing with his Request before the Refusal Notice was issued. WCC consider that Mr H M may have misunderstood its approach in this regard. WCC say its approach was based on guidance from the Commissioner, which essentially permits a public authority to carry out some searches for the requested information (if it so wishes) without an initial estimate and then to stop searching as soon as it realises that the appropriate limit will be exceeded. This is what WCC said it did and the Commissioner found that WCC had correctly applied the section 12 exclusion. 29. Mr H M is critical of the methodology applied by WCC to test whether the appropriate limit had been exceeded. WCC says it is based on the Commissioner’s guidance. The guidance suggests taking a test sample or samples and if the limit is exceeded there is no need to continue with the exercise. The “random” category 11 taken by WCC to test whether section 12 would be met does not seem to us to cover any part of the Request. If another category of request had been considered first then it may have taken much less time and some information could have been provided within the appropriate limit if the requests had been narrowed. 7EA/2014/0217 30. Mr H M believed that the information he requested would have been collated by WCC as a Briefing Paper for the Leader, prior to the meeting he attended in November 2013, so it should have been easy to locate. However we have no evidence of this. 31. Moreover Mr H M’s criticism of how WCC calculated the number of hours involved would seem to have merit. Regulation 4 of the Fees Regulations sets out the activities which can be taken into account in estimating costs. It does not state how a public authority should go about the estimation process. The Commissioner’s letter to WCC during his investigation of the complaint dated 21 March 2014 stated that the estimate should be based on “the quickest method of gathering the information”, which it seems to us was not necessarily the method chosen. 32. The Commissioner is critical of the process – see §27-29 DN but concluded that he was satisfied that the exercise was sufficient to establish that dealing with all 11 categories of requests would exceed the appropriate limit. 33. Despite the unsatisfactory nature of some aspects of the exercise, on the balance of probabilities, having considered the evidence before us, we would come to the same conclusion. The exercise undertaken was not necessarily the approach we would have taken but was certainly within the range of reasonable approaches that could have been taken. It is not for us to step into the shoes of WCC only to determine whether the approach taken by WCC in the circumstances of this case was reasonable. 34. Mr H M’s next ground of appeal is that the Commissioner was wrong to find that WCC had offered advice and assistance to help him refine his Request for information, such that WCC had complied with its obligations under section 16 FOIA. 35. The Commissioner found that WCC’s suggestion, that Mr H M liaise with other members of FVW about the requests for information they had made to WCC to see whether the requests could be narrowed or refined, to be a sensible one (§38 DN). However, we note that in the internal review letter dated 23 December 2013 WCC stated “…you were not provided with any specific suggestions on how to refine the requests…” . 36. Although Mr H M seemed to be adamant that he was not working in concert or as part of a campaign he did try to follow the advice by contacting the FVW bearing in mind he did not know who the other requesters were, but received no feedback. Mr H M could still have narrowed his Request but on the evidence before us he chose not to. 37. We have considered all the circumstances and on balance have decided that WCC did comply with its section 16 obligations although we do have some concerns which are expressed above. Having determined that Mr H 8EA/2014/0217 M’s Request should be aggregated with the other requests, WCC’s advise that he should liaise with the other requesters to narrow the scope of the requests in our view satisfied its obligation. 38. We note that it was WCC’s intention to provide answers to questions on its web site and this may now have been done so that Mr H M has answers to some parts of his Request. If not he can always exercise his right to make another request particularly because the requests referred to in this case were made sometime ago. If he does so it may help if he bears in mind that he can only request information held by WCC and his request should be framed accordingly (as the Commissioner had set out in §§ 40 and 41 of the DN). 39. Mr H M also complains that it does not appear that the Commissioner took into account ‘equality and diversity’ issues behind his requests. The Commissioner understands Mr H M’s argument to be that WCC is ‘dealing with the parents/carers of children who have disabilities so profound that are in receipt of statutory service provision’. 40. The Commissioner was aware of the background to the requests for information. It is, however, an established principle that a request for information under FOIA received by a public authority should generally be considered as ‘disclosure to the world’1. In other words, in most cases, the identity of the person requesting information or the motive for the request(s) is not relevant to the public authority’s statutory obligations. 41. This principle was recognised in the Upper Tribunal case of Webber v Information Commissioner & Nottinghamshire Health Care NHS Trust GIA/4090/2012, in which Ms Webber had sought information about her deceased son from the hospital trust which had been treating him shortly before his death (§ 37). 42. Accordingly, while recognising Mr H M’s own desire to obtain as much information as possible about the IDS, the Commissioner was right to find that the WCC was not required to take into account Mr H M’s reasons for the Request when considering its reliance on section 12 FOIA. 43. Mr H M seeks in his outcomes of the appeal that the Commissioner provides ‘clarification … as to how it applies equality and diversity considerations to its decision notice process’. It has chosen not to and this is a matter which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider (section 58(1)(a)). 1 In certain instances the requester’s identity is relevant to the public authority’s consideration of the request (for instance, section 14 [vexatious or repeated request], section 21 [information reasonably available to the applicant] and section 40(1) [information which is the personal data of the requester]). Those situations are not relevant to this appeal. 9EA/2014/0217 44. Finally Mr H M complains that the Commissioner took a long time to consider his section 50 FOIA application and should have explained to him that he should have rephrased his questions so that they asked for recorded information, not questions which may have required the creation of new recorded information which was not held at the time of the Request. 45. Again this is not a matter that we can deal with because we have no jurisdiction under section 58 to consider matters which are unrelated to whether the DN is in accordance with the law. 46.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction and Summary of Conclusions 1. This appeal is against a Decision Notice of the Information Commissioner dated 11 March 2014 (“the Decision Notice”), in which the Information Commissioner decided that the Office of Fair Trading had been entitled to refuse a request for information submitted by the Appellant because the information was exempt information under sections 31 (prejudice to law enforcement) and 44 (statutory prohibition on disclosure) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). Since the Decision Notice was issued the relevant functions of the Office of Fair Trading have been assumed by the Competition and Markets Authority, the Second Respondent to the Appeal. For simplicity we will refer to both bodies as “the Public Authority”. 2. We have decided that, with the exception of information contained in a few documents held by the Public Authority, the Information Commissioner was right to conclude that it had been justified in refusing the information request. The documents to be disclosed are listed in a confidential annex to this decision together with our detailed reasons for ordering disclosure. However we give a general indication of those reasons in paragraphs 41- 43 below. Background facts3. The Public Authority has powers under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA 1974”) to monitor the operations of those holding a consumer credit licence. In particular it may impose “requirements” on licence holders where it is dissatisfied with their conduct and it may also, where appropriate, suspend or revoke an organisation’s licence. On 7 December 2010 it exercised those powers by issuing a notice addressed to Firstplus Financial Group PLC (“Firstplus”) requiring it to (a) follow its existing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and official guidance, and (b) not to change those policies and procedures for a period of three years without prior notification to the Public Authority. This notice of requirements was issued at the end of an investigation into the operation by Firstplus of an interest variation provision included in its standard contract for second charge loans. However, the notice did not contain any indication of the facts uncovered during the investigation or the reasons for deciding that a notice of requirements was justified and appropriate. 4. The Appellant had become concerned that the terms regarding interest in the Firstplus second charge loan documentation were unfair, in particular an interest rate variation provision. Since 2009 the Appellant and other members of a campaign group, of which he is a member, have corresponded with the Public Authority with a view to persuading it to take action against Firstplus. They were particularly concerned at what they thought was a lenient approach by the Public Authority in imposing an apparently mild sanction on Firstplus and declining to provide detailed findings arising from its investigation or reasoned arguments for adopting the approach that it did. The request for information and the scope of enquiry arising under it 5. The Decision Notice proceeded on the basis that the request for information which led ultimately to this Appeal was contained in an email dated 26 June 2013 and covered, (to quote from paragraph 2 of the Decision Notice), “any information concerning adverse behaviour” by Firstplus. We became concerned, during the hearing of the Appeal, that the information request, when read in context, might have a broader meaning and asked the parties to provide us with the complete sequence of correspondence that preceded the email of 26 June 2013. 6. The material provided by the parties at that stage, read alongside other material in the bundle of documents prepared for the Appeal, demonstrated the following history: a. The Appellant entered into correspondence with the Public Authority about what he regarded as its inadequate response to the perceived unfairness of the operation by Firstplus of its interest provision. This had led to interest charges increasing (to 13.9% in some cases) during a period of time when interestrates, generally, were reducing. The Appellant’s evident purpose was to both complain about how the Public Authority had dealt with the matter in the past and to seek its assistance for the future. In that context he made it clear that he was contemplating legal proceedings against Firstplus and wished to know what Firstplus had been found guilty of by the Public Authority to justify the imposition of formal requirements. b. On 13 May 2013 the Public Authority, in the form of its Head of the Enquiries and Reporting Centre, wrote to the Appellant in an apparent attempt to pull together the various points he had raised. Having first defended the speed and adequacy of the Public Authority’s responses, the letter went on to identify a possible request for the disclosure of information under either the FOIA or the Enterprise Act 2002 (“EA 2002“). (In certain circumstances the Public Authority has a discretion under EA 2002 to disclose information it has acquired in confidence if the information is required for the purpose of litigation – see paragraph 15 below.) Although the letter provided detailed reasons for refusing to disclose under EA 2002 it said nothing about FOIA. c. The Appellant sent a reply to the Public Authority on the same day in which he said: “…we consumers are not being treated fairly/reasonably nor do we have access to a free market for the purpose of access to competition hence exploitation. Humble consumers like myself have no choice but to rely on their regulators to look into these matters & find some common ground with a regard to fixing this situation, I find it very difficult to believe that this can be ignored/let to continue without some kind of investigation.” d. In an email of 3 June 2013 the Appellant tried to be more specific in stating that he would like “any information you may be able to provide…”. That prompted a response from the Public Authority which disclosed uncertainty as to whether the Appellant was in fact intending to make an information request under FOIA. It went on to say: “if you advise us that you are in fact making a request for information under the FOIA, before we are able to deal with it, you will need to clearly describe the information that you are seeking so that we can consider whether we hold the requested information and whether or not we are under a duty to disclose it to you taking into account the exemptions which may apply.”e. On 11 June 2013 the Appellant emailed in reply, explaining some of the legal and administrative steps being taken by him and others in respect of Firstplus and seeming to suggest that he would like any information which the Public Authority held which might assist those processes. The Public Authority’s response to that communication, in a letter dated 21 June 2013, was to reiterate that it did not intend to treat any of the previous communications as a request for information under FOIA and that, if that was the Appellant’s intention, “you would need to describe the information sought to enable the OFT to consider (1) whether we hold the information requested and (2) whether or not the OFT was under any duty to disclose it.” f. On 21 June 2013 the Appellant sent the Public Authority an email in which he confirmed that he did wish to pursue the FOIA route to obtain information. His explanation of exactly what he sought is a little difficult to follow but we believe a fair reading of the document is that the information sought was any relating to the interest variation provisions relied on by Firstplus that had led the Public Authority to conclude that its requirements letter was appropriate. The Public Authority, however, stated, in a letter dated 26 June 2013 that it was still not clear to it what information was being sought and sought clarification of “what specifically you are requesting under FOIA”. g. The Appellant provided his answer to the question in an email sent on the same date, which clarified that his underlying complaint was about the operation by Firstplus of interest rates and “associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends & fair/unfair terms.” The email continued: “I would be grateful if it would be considered that any information held on related subject matter which could bring about a more informed conclusion on these matters specifically from the [Financial Ombudsman Service] initially & possibly in a legal capacity should matters have to go that far. … “If information is being held concerning adverse behaviour by [Firstplus] in relation to any of this in total or specific then I must request that consideration is given to release that information.” h. The Public Authority treated that email as a request for information under FOIA concerning adverse behaviour by Firstplus in relation to “interest rates and associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends and fair/unfair terms” Our view as to the scope of the request for information.7. We interpret the request, in the context summarised above, as being for information relied on by the Public Authority in reaching the decision to impose requirements on Firstplus and/or disclosing the approach adopted by the Public Authority to its investigation, including the record of its conclusions and the public availability of that record. We do not think that the Appellant was asking for information about any allegations that others may have made from time to time, nor of facts or evidence that those other complainants may have presented to the OFT. He was looking for the Public Authority’s findings, in a form which he could utilise in order to support his campaign, including the pursuit of the civil claim he evidently had in mind. 8. It is evident that the Public Authority interpreted the information request more broadly in some respects (such as complaints and information requests received from third parties), and more narrowly in others (so as to exclude its detailed conclusions and its decision not to include them in the requirements notice). The Public Authority’s response to the information request 9. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 10. The Public Authority refused the Appellant’s request for information in a letter to him dated 3 July 2013. It stated that disclosure would prejudice the Public Authority’s ability to carry out effectively its investigatory functions and that the requested information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 31(1)(a) and (g). The relevant parts of that provision are as follows: “Information … is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice – (a) the prevention or detection of crime, … (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), …”“(2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are – (a) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, (b) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, (c)the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise, (d) the purpose of ascertaining a person’s fitness or competence in relation to the management of bodies corporate or in relation to any profession or other activity which he is, or seeks to become, authorised to carry on, …” 11. The basis of the Public Authority’s reliance on this exemption was expressed in these terms: “Persons conducting investigations need sufficient space to carry out their work, free of interference and any risk the investigation will be undermined by the disclosure of information about the way in which an investigation has been conducted, the internal processes that were followed, and the relevant information from other sources.” 12. The Public Authority acknowledged that the exemption was a qualified exemption, so that the information would still have to be disclosed unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. It informed the Appellant that it acknowledged that there was a strong public interest in transparency but considered that this was outweighed by the public interest in maintaining confidence in its system of regulatory enforcement. 13. The refusal was maintained following an internal review carried out at the Appellant’s request. At that stage the Public Authority indicated, in a letter to the Appellant dated 13 August 2013, that it proposed to rely on FOIA section 31(1)(g), rather than 31(1)(a). It also asserted that it was entitled to rely, in addition, on FOIA section 44(1)(a), read alongside EA 2002 section 237. 14. FOIA section 44 reads: “(1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it – (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment.” EA 2002 section 237 reads: “(1) This section applies to specified information which relates to-(a) … (b) any business of an undertaking. (2) Such information must not be disclosed – (a) … (b) while the undertaking continues in existence unless the disclosure is permitted under this Part.” EA 2002 section 238, as applied to the facts of this case, provides that “specified information” is information which “comes to” the Public Authority in connection with the exercise of certain functions, including the conduct of investigations under the CCA 1974. 15. There are certain circumstances where, notwithstanding the prohibition set out in section 237, the Public Authority may disclose relevant information. The use of the word “may” demonstrates that the Public Authority would have a discretion as to whether or not to disclose: it would not be obliged to do so. One of the circumstances in which the Public Authority would be able to exercise the discretion in favour of disclosure is where information is sought for the purpose of establishing or enforcing legal rights through a civil claim (EA 2002 section 241A(1)). 16. FOIA section 44 is an absolute exemption. If it is found to be engaged then disclosure need not be made: there is no requirement to consider the public interest balance under FOIA section 2. 17. The Public Authority also indicated at this stage that it wished to rely also upon FOIA section 40 (in order to protect the personal data of individuals who might be identified in documents covered by the information request), as well as section 42 (to protect material included in such documents which was covered by legal professional privilege). 18. The Appellant’s response to the outcome of the internal review was to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner about the way in which his information request had been handled. The Information Commissioner’s investigation and the Decision Notice 19. Early in the Information Commissioner’s investigation he indicated that he did not intend to focus his investigation on the section 40 and section 42 exemptions because the information they covered was included in the same documents for which the original two exemptions were asserted. At the same time the Information Commissioner asked the Public Authority for a copy of the withheld information but, in light of its statutory obligation to maintain confidence, the Public Authority declined to release it without a formal Information Notice first being issued. Once that had been issued the Public Authority provided the Information Commissioner with a quantity of material which it said fell within the wide scope of the information request. The material hadbeen marked up manually to indicate which exemption was relied on in respect of each item of withheld information. 20. On 11 March 2014 the Information Commissioner issued the Decision Notice. He concluded that FOIA section 44 applied to the information in respect of which it was relied on by the Public Authority. It was information which had come to the Public Authority in the course of its investigation of complaints made about Firstplus and clearly related to the business of that company or to individuals mentioned within the information. 21. Although the decision under FOIA section 44 covered most of the withheld information there was some which did not fall within it and the Information Commissioner accordingly considered it in the context of FOIA section 31. He was satisfied that the Public Authority did have law enforcement powers that brought its activities within section 31(2) and that disclosure of the relevant information would reveal how it went about its work under CCA 1974 and would make it harder to do future work of that nature. He also concluded that disclosure would lead to the discouragement of those who might otherwise cooperate with the Public Authority. The exemption was therefore engaged, in his view. As to the public interest test the Information Commissioner acknowledged that there was a public interest in disclosure, because this would promote greater transparency and accountability in the Public Authority’s actions. In that context he drew attention to a number of individuals, who were in a similar situation to that of the Appellant and who had expressed concern about the outcome of the Public Authority’s investigation of Firstplus. He set in the balance against those considerations the public interest in the effective operation of the Public Authority’s regulatory functions, which he thought would be undermined if its methods of investigation were to be disclosed. Those being investigated would not feel able to deal frankly with it when being investigated and communications within the investigating team might become more guarded. He saw strength in that argument even though the investigation of Firstplus had been completed by the time that the information request was submitted. He also took into account that the information which had been withheld under FOIA section 31(1)(g), and which was not otherwise exempt under section 44, was minimal and would add little to public understanding. 22. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Public Authority should be able to regulate the credit licence regime, for the benefit of consumers as a whole, and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption therefore outweighed the public interest in disclosure. The Appeal to this Tribunal 23. On 17 March 2014 the Appellant lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice with this Tribunal.24. Such Appeals are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 25. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal did not seek to join issue with the detailed arguments set out in the Decision Notice. The essence of his argument was that the injustices which he felt had been suffered by people like him, who were trapped into second charge agreements at high interest rates, should outweigh the advantage of confidentiality in the regulatory processes. On that basis he asked, in effect, for the withheld information to be reviewed to see what could be made available in order to provide the public with information about the Public Authority’s investigation and its decision to serve a notice of requirements on Firstplus which did not record, or was not accompanied by, its reasons for doing so. 26. In a written Response filed by the Information Commissioner on 11 April 2014 it was argued that the effect of the Grounds of Appeal was to challenge the application of the public interest balance arising under FOIA section 31 and that there was therefore no challenge to the conclusions in the Decision Notice to the effect that the exemption was engaged. Nor, it was said, was there a challenge to the conclusion that the section 44 exemption was engaged and, in that respect, there was no requirement to consider the public interest because the exemption was absolute. 27. The Appellant did seek to clarify his Grounds of Appeal, in response to an invitation to that effect from the Tribunal Registrar, by asserting that he did wish to challenge the engagement of the section 44 exemption. However, his supporting arguments reverted to a general concern that the FOIA should not be used to prevent him, and others in a similar position to him, from being given the information requested. 28. On 21 May 2014 a Direction Notice was issued by the Chamber President to the effect that the Public Authority should be made a party to the Appeal. On 19 June 2014 the Public Authority filed its own written Response to the Appeal. It largely supported the Information Commissioner but also drew attention to the potential danger of disclosing information which might be said to have not “come to” the Public Authority and therefore to be outside the scope of the statutory prohibition relied on. Such information would, it was said, be of limited practical value for the purposes of anyone seeking to use it to call into question the appropriateness of the decision to either take, or not take, particular regulatory or enforcement actions against a holder of a consumer credit licence. It added:“It would be difficult for any fair-minded person to form any view about the appropriateness or otherwise of the [Public Authority’s] actions, on the basis of internal communications or other documents from which all information that had “come to” the OFT had been excised.” 29. The Appellant chose to have his Appeal considered at a hearing, rather than on the papers. That was his right. However, neither the Information Commissioner nor the Public Authority attended the hearing, both preferring to have the case determined on the basis of their written submissions. 30. The Tribunal was provided with the withheld information, in the same format as submitted to the Information Commissioner during his investigation. It was substantial in bulk and provided in unpaginated files, in reverse date order with a degree of overlap between the contents of different sections and an inadequate index. The Public Authority sought to impose on the Tribunal strict terms as to how the materials should be handled in order to prevent it being seen by any third party, including the Appellant. This included a requirement that the Appellant should not even be allowed to see how much material was involved. It was therefore necessary for the material to be placed in a secure place, outside the hearing room, while the appeal proceeded. It also led to the panel gaining access to the material rather too close to the date of the hearing than was desirable. 31. At the hearing the Appellant accepted that, in light of the Public Authority’s Response, the terms of FOIA section 44 left very little scope for him to develop the argument foreshadowed in his Grounds of Appeal: if and to the extent that withheld information was covered by the statutory prohibition there could be no reason to order its disclosure. His argument did, however, have impact on both the extent to which withheld information fell within the statutory prohibition for the purposes of FOIA section 44 and the issue of whether FOIA section 31 was engaged (and, if it was, the operation of the public interest balance). 32. The Appellant reiterated during the hearing that his interest was, not in seeing every item of information assembled by the Public Authority during the investigation, or every issue taken into consideration by those conducting the investigation. He simply wanted to know what it was that satisfied the Public Authority that it should issue a notice of requirements in the form that it did. The Tribunal’s deliberations and conclusions 33. The Tribunal panel has carefully considered every document made available to it by the Public Authority. This was done in part on the day of the hearing but, due to the late availability of the closed material andthe way in which it had been assembled, it was necessary to reconvene at a subsequent meeting. 34. We found that some of the material did not require to be disclosed because it falls outside the scope of the information request. We found that the withheld information included material relating to complaints and criticisms of the Public Authority submitted by individuals, (other than the Appellant) or groups. It also included requests for information from those individuals or groups. In some cases the correspondence included specific allegations about Firstplus and the way that it conducted its business. We considered that, in light of the interpretation of the information request in context, as summarised at paragraphs 7 and 8 above, these materials fell outside the scope of the information request and they were accordingly discarded. 35. Our overall conclusion is that the great majority of the remaining documents contained information falling within the scope of the information request and was properly withheld. 36. A careful study of the material satisfied us that many of the documents included information gathered by the Public Authority during the course of its investigation. They clearly recorded information that had “come to” the Public Authority in the course of performing its duties and fell within the statutory prohibition under CCA 1974. The information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 44. The materials took the form of written evidence, submissions presented to the Public Authority and notes made at meetings. On the whole we accepted that this exemption had only been relied upon in respect of documents that were clearly covered by it. 37. With respect to FOIA section 31, we accept the arguments put to us by the Information Commissioner and the Public Authority that those carrying out an investigation should be granted a considerable degree of confidentiality so that their working methods, and the thinking processes involved in assessing evidence and working towards conclusions, should not be available to the public, including those who might have an unworthy motive for obtaining such information. We are satisfied, therefore, that the Public Authority’s investigatory activities would be prejudiced if this category of information were to be disclosed. We are also satisfied that, with a few exceptions, the documents marked by the Public Authority as ones to which, he argued, this exemption applied were properly categorised as such. 38. Some of the material for which this exemption was claimed was anodyne in content. For example, it simply recorded arrangements for a meeting. In those circumstances the case for claiming that the section 31 exemption was engaged is less strong. However, as the information contained in such a document would not provide the Appellant with any of the sort of information he seeks, it would, in any event, fall outside the scope of the information request.39. The public interest in maintaining the section 31 exemption would have been stronger had the notice of requirement included, or been accompanied by, an explanation of what it was that had convinced the Public Authority that the service of such a notice was appropriate. However, we are satisfied that preserving privacy in respect of the investigation is sufficiently important that it outweighs the public interest in the disclosure of much of the material covered by this exemption. 40. In the course of our review of the materials we identified a small number of documents which are not exempt and should be disclosed. We have set out in a confidential annex to this decision our reasons for concluding that they fell within the scope of the information request and should be disclosed. 41. We are able to say, in this open part of our decision that in some cases the documents did not contain any information falling within the scope of the prohibition in EA section 237. In others the information that would bring the document within the scope of that provision can be redacted without the document as a whole losing its meaning. We have indicated in the confidential annex the redactions which should be made. 42. In some cases we have concluded that the exemption provided under FOIA section 31 does not apply because the document was created after the investigation had been completed and a decision made. We have also concluded, in those cases, that even if the exemption had applied the public interest in disclosure is at least equal to the public interest in continued secrecy so that the exemption may not be maintained under FOIA section 2(2)(b). 43. In every case where we have concluded that neither section 31 nor section 44 of the FOIA prevent disclosure we have considered, also, whether the exemptions provided in either section 40 (third party personal data) or section 42 (legal professional privilege) might apply. We are satisfied that, for the most part, the seniority of those identified justifies disclosure (because it would not constitute a breach of the data protection principles), but the names of less senior individuals have been redacted. We have made an appropriate redaction to one of the documents in order to protect legal professional privilege. We accordingly direct that the Public Authority disclose the documents identified in the annex, and redacted in accordance with guidance we have provided there, within 35 days of the date of this decision. 44. The confidential annex should itself remain confidential until the time for appealing this decision has expired and, in the event that an appeal has been filed by then, that appeal has either been withdrawn or disposed of. 45. Our decision is unanimous.Chris Ryan Judge 21st January 2015"

This appeal is concerned with the application of the Freedom of Information Act (‘FOIA’) exemption relating to formulation of government policy (FOIA s35) to information about the Government’s consideration of and response to recommendations made by the Senior Salaries Review Body (‘SSRB’) regarding salaried Employment Judges. 2. We gave a preliminary decision in this appeal on 2 February 2014. By that decision we made findings of fact (paragraphs 17-42), determined the meaning and scope of the information request (paragraphs 44-57), made certain determinations about the application of FOIA s40(2) (paragraphs 58- 62), and gave further procedural directions which included a requirement for further searches by the MOJ. Our decision required the disclosure of certain documents to the appellant. We reserved for future consideration: a. such further findings of fact as might arise from the parties’ compliance with the directions; b. the application of s35(1)(a) to the material in the then current closed bundle, and the application of s35(1)(a) and any other exemption that might be relevant to further disputed information not contained in that bundle; c. the public interest balance, as between disclosure or maintaining the s35(1)(a) exemption and/or any other qualified exemption which might be relied on as a result of compliance with the directions. 3. The further searches made by the MOJ led to the identification of further documents falling within the scope of the information request. These comprised four documents which were disclosed to the appellant1 and Documents 7-9 (described further below). 4. Document 8 is a submission dated 2 September 2011 to the Permanent Secretary and Lord Chancellor on the draft 2011 MOJ information document for the SSRB. The Information Commissioner took the view2 that in relation to Document 8 the public interest balance did not favour the maintenance of the s35(1)(a) exemption. Subject to some redactions which, so far as we are aware, are uncontroversial, the MOJ decided to disclose Document 8 to the appellant. 5. In the light of what was said by the MOJ on 24 March 2014 concerning the further searches, the appellant sought orders for yet further searches and for recovery and preservation of documents. The MOJ agreed to make the additional searches and to provide witness evidence about them. The additional searches led to the identification of yet further documents falling 1 As listed in the MOJ’s email of 24 March 2014. 2 In submissions dated 3 April 2014. -3-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 within the scope of the information request.

MOJ’s open submissions by email of 24 March 2014. b. Information Commissioner’s open and closed submissions 3 April 2014. c. Appellant’s submissions 17 April 2014. d.

We take as read the background set out in paragraphs 4-15 of our preliminary decision and the facts as found in paragraphs 17-42 of that decision. 8. For ease of reference we set out again here the appellant’s information request of 20 September 2012. He requested information regarding: 1. Any decision not to implement the recommendations of the SSRB in their 33rd Report that the role of salaried Employment Judge be re-graded to judicial salary band 6.2. 2. Any decision not to implement the recommendations of the SSRB in their 34th Report that the role of salaried Employment Judge be re-graded to judicial salary band 6.2. 3. If no decision has yet been taken as to whether to implement the recommendations of either Report, considerations of the Reports to date and the outcome of those considerations, the process by which such decisions will be taken upon them, by whom such decisions will be made and when. 4. The government’s policy and/or position on the difference (if any) between re-grading of a post to a higher salary band and a salary increase and the rationale for such policy and/or position. 9. Arising from the facts as previously found we highlight the following matters, which are germane to the issues remaining for us to decide: a. High quality and genuine independence of the judiciary are essential features of a modern well-functioning state. For this reason, effective arrangements for the protection of levels of judicial remuneration are of 3 Our above brief description of documents 7-19 of the closed bundle is without prejudice to any question about specific parts of those documents falling outside the scope of the appellant’s information request. We consider this separately below. -4-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 constitutional importance. In the UK the SSRB is part of those arrangements. b. The SSRB’s 33rd report in March 2011 expressed the view, based on job evaluation, that the role of salaried Employment Judge within the Tribunals Service should be re-graded from salary group 7 to salary group 6.2. The 33rd report accepted there could be delay in implementation, owing to the prevailing pay freeze, while inviting the Government to act sooner rather than later. In response, the Government decided that the pay freeze must prevail. c. The 34th report in March 2012 expressed the view that, notwithstanding the pay freeze, the re-grading (and consequent increased remuneration) should be implemented immediately. In response, the Government again decided that the pay freeze must prevail. d. The participants at the meeting of MOJ officials with representatives of the Council of Employment Judges in July 2012 knew of no prior instance of the Government not accepting a re-grading recommendation made by the SSRB, except for phasing it in. Mr Ian Gray of the MOJ said at the meeting that he would be very surprised if, at the next pay round, recommendations made by the SSRB were held over for consideration at a later date. e. At the time of the information request (20 September 2012), the pay freeze was due to be ameliorated as from April 2013 to permit an average 1% per annum increase in the public sector pay bill for two years. About September 2012 the Government must have decided that the line it would take for the next SSRB review was that it would not be possible to implement the SSRB’s review recommendations and stay within the stipulated 1% average increase. f. The disappointment among Employment Judges that the Government regarded the pay freeze as impacting on and taking priority over the recommendation for re-grading was (and remains) profound. 10. The additional materials now available to us do not alter any of the facts previously found. They do, however, add to the picture. 11. Since our earlier decision Mr Gray of the MOJ has remained unwell and absent from work. 12. Mr Duncan Rutty (who is also mentioned in our earlier decision) was at the time of the information request a Judicial Reward Policy Officer (Band B) in the Judicial Reward and Pension Reform Team at the MOJ. He originally searched only for information falling within part 3 of the information request. In August 2013 he moved to the Home Office, at which time his email account was closed and emptied. However, the contents were retained in an archive, called E Vault. He returned to the MOJ in January 2014. After retrieval of his emails, he searched again (without restriction to part 3 of the request) and found an additional six documents falling within the request. These are now items 10-12 and 15-17 in the closed bundle. 13. The responsibilities of the Judicial Reward and Pension Reform Team include the formulation of policy positions on judicial pay and advising Ministers on the judicial pay process. As part of this process, and prior to making recommendations to Ministers, the Team requests and considers the -5-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 views of key stakeholders. A primary stakeholder for this purpose is HMCTS, which is an executive agency within the MOJ. While HMCTS provides its views on judicial pay, the responsibilities for formulating policy and making recommendations, for approval by Ministers, remain with the Judicial Reward and Pension Reform Team. 14. Ms Shirley Hales is employed by the MOJ as the Team Manager for Judicial Pay and Pensions and the Scheme Administrator for the Judicial Pensions Scheme (Band A/Grade 7). In March 2014 she undertook a further search in her own emails and in the MOJ’s electronic document management system, known as TRIM, but found nothing fresh. She also searched Mr Gray’s email inbox, where she found three relevant documents, which are now items 13, 14 and 18 in the closed bundle. (Her statement also provided information on the MOJ’s policy on deletion of emails; it is not necessary for us to refer to this further here, but we append some remarks on it below, near the end of our decision.) 15. We described closed documents 1-6 in paragraphs 11 and 14 of our preliminary decision. Documents 7-18 of the enlarged closed bundle may be described, without revealing their confidential contents, in particular as to policy formulation, as follows4: Doc 7 – submission dated 2 March 2011 from Mr Rutty to Permanent Secretary and Lord Chancellor seeking approval for proposed response to the judicial aspects of the SSRB 2011 report (4 pages, marked ‘Restricted – Policy’). Doc 9 – submission dated 1 March 2012 from Mr Rutty to Permanent Secretary and Lord Chancellor seeking approval for proposed response to the judicial aspects of the SSRB 2012 report (3 pages, marked ‘Restricted – Policy’). Doc 10 – submission dated 23 April 2012 from Mr Rutty to Peter Handcock (Chief Executive of HMCTS) and Helen Edwards (Acting Permanent Secretary) (5 pages, marked ‘Restricted’, and a one page annex). This seeks clearance for a proposed judicial pay strategy following the pay freeze, prior to sending a submission to the Lord Chancellor (ie, prior to Document 1). It is possible that this is only a draft. See Document 13. Doc 11 – email chain dated from 20 to 27 April 2012 between Mr Rutty and Mr Gray (2 pages, unmarked). This relates to and attaches Document 10. Doc 12 – email chain containing email between John Pearson (HMCTS) and Kevin Sadler (HMCTS) dated 26 April 2012, and email between Mr Rutty and Mike Hirst dated 30 April 2012, attaching an internal HMCTS submission from Pearson to Sadler dated 26 April 2012 (1 page of emails, 3 page submission, both marked ‘Restricted – Policy’). This concerns views from HMCTS on the recommendations made by the SSRB. 4 In these descriptions we take our lead from and substantially follow the descriptions given in the open statements of Mr Rutty and Ms Hales. -6-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 Doc 13 – submission dated 3 May 2012 from Mr Rutty to Peter Handcock (Chief Executive of HMCTS) and Helen Edwards (Acting Permanent Secretary). This is a later version of Document 10.5 Doc 14 – emails of 14, 23 and 25 May 2012, headed ‘Restricted – policy – SSRB major review recommendations – letter from the Council of Employment Judges’. These emails merely deal with clearance from the Lord Chancellor’s Private Office for a letter to be sent; they contain no policy discussion or consideration of the SSRB reports (3 pages, including the letter).6 Doc 15 – email chain dated 16 and 17 July 2012 between Craig Robb (Head of Jurisdictional Support (Employment)) and Mr Rutty (2 pages, marked ‘Protect – Policy’). These communications followed the meeting held with the Council of Employment Judges delegation on 13 July 2012. (The closed bundle does not include the attachments, which we have not seen, and which Mr Rutty’s statement says are outside the scope of the information request.) Doc 16 – email dated 31 July 2012 from Mr Rutty to Emma Lochhead (Human Resources Director, MOJ) (1 page), attaching and commenting on a draft of Document 17. Doc 17 – minute dated 10 August 2012 from Mr Gray to Antonia Romeo (Director-General of the MOJ Corporate Performance Group) (2 pages, unmarked), attaching Document 1 and Document 4. This relates to the approach to judicial pay from April 2013 and the 2012 judicial remuneration evidence document for the SSRB. Doc 18 – submission dated 18 September 2012 from Mr Rutty to the Permanent Secretary and the Lord Chancellor, seeking approval of MOJ response to the SSRB’s request for evidence for its 2013 report (3 pages, marked ‘Restricted’), with annexes (44 pages). The first 33 pages of the annexes (numbered as pages 119-152 in our bundle) correspond, with immaterial differences, to the final version of the evidence dated 16 October 2012 and published on 29 November 2012. The next four pages of annexes comprise the SSRB’s two letters dated 20 July 2012, requesting evidence for its 2013 report. The last six pages of annexes comprise a copy of Documents 1 and 2. 16. The existence and nature of these documents confirms our understanding of the general process of consideration and decision-making, as set out in paragraphs 19, 26, 31 and 37 of our preliminary decision. 17. We accept Mr Gray’s evidence in paragraph 10 of his witness statement in the sense that as at the date of his statement (1 November 2013), while there had been a consideration of the consistency of the impact of the suite of SSRB recommendations with the prevailing policy on public sector pay 5 Between pages 43 and 44 of the Closed Bundle there was a page missing, which, following our request, was supplied to the Tribunal on 10 September 2014, marked as page 43A. Behind Document 13, at page 46 of the Closed Bundle, there is a copy of the first page of the letter from the Council of Employment Judges to the Lord Chancellor, dated 25 April 2012. This letter has already been disclosed to the appellant and need not be further considered. 6 Pages 51-98 of the closed bundle are inserted after Document 14. They do not have a document number and are not described in the index. They consist simply of duplicates of Document 18 and its annexes. We therefore disregard them. -7-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 restraint, there had been no Ministerial consideration of the individual recommendations of the SSRB report concerning re-grading, and therefore no final decisions had been taken in relation to the recommendations. So far as we are aware, that remains the position. 18. We make further findings of fact, based on our examination of the closed documents, in the Confidential Annex to this decision. Closed Documents: whether within scope of request and whether properly treated as ‘closed’ 19. Documents 3 and 8 have been disclosed and it is not necessary for us to say any more about them at this point. 20. As regards scope, we stated our views on Documents 1 and 2 in paragraph 56 of our preliminary decision. The same considerations apply to Document 4. The MOJ accepts that all of Document 6 is within the scope of the request. 21. Documents 7 and 9-18, as contained in the enlarged closed bundle, do not contain any markings indicating that any parts of them are claimed by the MOJ to fall outside the scope of the information request. The MOJ’s submissions of 5 June 2014 similarly do not contend that any parts of those documents are outside scope. Ms Hales’ statement describes Document 14 as ‘relating to’ policy discussion, though not containing any, and as being included ‘for completeness’. Since she states that it is withheld under FOIA s35(1)(a), we infer that the MOJ accepts that Document 14 is within the scope of the request. 22. We give additional reasoning in relation to scope in paragraph 1 of the Confidential Annex to this decision. The general nature of the point made there is that the scope of information requested concerning consideration of the 33rd and 34th SSRB Reports is necessarily wide. It would be artificial and misleading to remove the remarks made concerning the position of salaried employment judges from their context. In our view the context is part of the consideration. 23. As we have indicated, the first 33 pages of the annexes to Document 18 (numbered as pages 119-152 in our bundle) correspond, with immaterial differences, to the final version of the evidence sent to the SSRB on 16 October 2012 and published on 29 November 2012. In the circumstances we see no sufficient reason for non-disclosure of this material to the appellant when the MOJ responded to his information request on 18 October 2012. But the question of disclosure is for practical purposes academic, since these pages contain no material information that is not now in the public domain. 24. We have no material which suggests that the SSRB’s two letters dated 20 July 2012, which form the next four pages of the annexes to Document 18, are in the public domain, but from their nature they do not appear to us to be confidential or sensitive. They are simply the SSRB’s requests for evidence. However, we consider them below on the assumption that s35(1)(a) applies to them. 25. The MOJ claims exemption under s35(1)(a) for all the information in the documents remaining in the enlarged closed bundle. We therefore turn next to the application of this exemption and the public interest balance. -8-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 Application of s35(1)(a) and the public interest balance (1) Interpretation 26. Section 35 provides: Information held by a government department ... is exempt information if it relates to- (a) the formulation or development of government policy. 27. The proper application of this exemption depends in part upon the nature of the connection intended by the use of the statutory phrase ‘relates to’. This phrase was discussed in the context of FOIA s23 by a First-tier Tribunal in APPGER v IC and FCO EA/2011/0049-0051, 3 May 2012, at [62], [64]-[65], [67]-[68]. 28. The phrase ‘relates to’, read literally, is potentially capable of indicating a very remote relationship. But in s35, as in s23, the function of the phrase ‘relates to ...’ is to demarcate the boundary of a FOIA exemption. It is clear, therefore, that it should not be read with uncritical literalism as extending to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, but instead must be read in a more limited sense so as to provide an intelligible boundary, suitable to and conditioned by the statutory context. 29. In APPGER [2012] at [68] the First-tier Tribunal decided that in s23 the phrase ‘relates to’ was directed to the content of the information – what the information was about; a less direct relationship would not qualify. While s35 differs from s23, we consider that this conclusion is equally applicable to s35. A merely incidental connection between the information and a matter specified in s35(1)(a) would not bring the exemption into play; it is the content of the information that must relate to the matter specified in the sub- paragraph. We do not think that this interpretation is inconsistent with the Tribunal’s remarks in Department for Education and Skills v IC and Evening Standard EA/2006/0006, 19 February 2007 at [52]-[54], but, if it is, we prefer it. We agree that the expression ‘formulation or development of government policy’ is reasonably broad, and in principle is to be contrasted with implementation of settled policy. We also consider helpful the valuable discussion of the nature and significance of the s35 exemption in the Department for Education case at [75], to which the parties drew our attention. 30. It has been held that the broadly worded exemption in s35(1)(a) is not an exemption which has an inherent or presumptive weight independent of the particular circumstances: Office of Government Commerce v IC [2008] EWHC 774 (Admin), [79]. We bear this in mind, but do not find it to be of real practical assistance. Even though extreme examples can be envisaged where s35 covers information which could not possibly be regarded as confidential, and which should certainly be disclosed to the public, in our view the general importance or desirability of a safe space for policy formulation and development is not in doubt, and the information of interest in the present appeal is not an extreme example of that kind. (2) Extent to which s35(1)(a) is engaged 31. The appellant argues that s35(1)(a) is not engaged in relation to any information falling within the first or second parts of his request, because such information relates to decisions taken, and to implementation of an already formulated policy. We do not accept this argument. If information which is -9-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 recorded at a particular time relates to the formulation or development of government policy, it continues so to relate even after a decision is taken7. The relevance of the completion of policy formulation is to the public interest balance on the basis that, depending on circumstances, protection of the information may be less important and the need for the safe space may have reduced once the decision has been taken. 32. The appellant places emphasis on our finding that decisions on the question of whether to implement the SSRB recommendations in the short-term had already been taken prior to the date of his information request. But the taking of short-term decisions not to implement them immediately did not remove the need for a further decision on whether to implement them at all. As the MOJ submits, the question of whether to follow the SSRB’s recommendations after the pay freezes ended remained to be finally concluded. Given this feature, and having considered the contents of the enlarged closed bundle, we agree with the MOJ and the Commissioner that s35(1)(a) is engaged in relation to Documents 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9-18. The information in those documents relates to the formulation or development of Government policy. We understand the logic of the appellant’s argument, but it presupposes that the information which he has requested is separate from information about consideration of the yet-to-be-taken ultimate decision. As the MOJ rightly observes, given the contents of the particular documents, it is not practicable to separate the information in those documents which relates to the decisions to defer consideration of re-grading until after the end of the pay freezes from the information which relates to the formulation of policy on whether ultimately to re-grade or not. 33. The appellant expresses concerns about the spectre of endless policy formulation, on the basis of assertions by a Government department that there might be a further decision taken in the future. In our view that extreme description does not fit this case. It is clear that at the time of the request a final decision on implementation of the SSRB recommendations had not been taken, whatever may or may not have been said in internal discussions below Ministerial level. (3) The interests protected by s35(1)(a) 34. In brief, s35(1)(a) reflects the need for a safe space in which government policy can be formulated and developed in robust discussions where participants are free to ‘think the unthinkable’ in order to test and develop ideas, without fear of external interference or distraction, whether as a result of premature and lurid media headlines or otherwise. This short identification of the relevant interests served by the exemption may be supplemented by reference to the very useful discussion of arguments concerning safe space, chilling effect, record keeping, and protection of officials in paragraphs 194- 204 and 211-212 of the Commissioner’s published guidance titled “Government policy (section 35)” version 1, 18 March 2013. We agree with those paragraphs of the Commissioner’s guidance. (4) The nature of the public interests potentially served by disclosure 35. The general philosophy of FOIA is that disclosure is generally in the public interest because it promotes good government through transparency, accountability, increased public confidence and public understanding, the 7 The express statutory exception to this, in s35(2), is not relevant here. - 10 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 effective exercise of democratic rights, and other related public goods. In general, the potential benefits of disclosure include the pressure to make governmental decisions and use governmental resources in ways that will withstand public scrutiny. They also include the enabling of constructive public debate, which in effect enlists the help of responsible members of the public in fostering good government. 36. The MOJ acknowledges8 the following public interest considerations favouring disclosure in the present case: a. The information relates to the SSRB recommendations for judicial pay, which are a matter of public interest. b. There is a public interest in increasing the transparency of the workings of Government in relation to considerations which inform judicial pay policy. c. Disclosure would perform an educative function concerning formation of Government policy in regard to SSRB recommendations and interaction between MOJ and stakeholders, including those lobbying for a particular response. d. Access to information about how policy decisions are reached, what options are being considered and why some are excluded and others preferred potentially generates meaningful participation between Government Departments and the public. Giving people access to information that will allow informed participation in the development of government proposals or decisions which are of concern to them is a key driver of the FOI legislation. e. Disclosure would promote accountability of the MOJ to the general public. 37. It is striking that this list prepared by the MOJ contains no express recognition of the public interest in the preservation of an independent and high quality judiciary or of the constitutional significance of the protection of judicial remuneration through a mechanism such as the SSRB. We would have expected the MOJ, of all Government Departments, to have had a particularly keen appreciation of these considerations and of their potential relevance to the public interest balance. What is even more striking is that the MOJ continued to leave them out of account, even after the appellant had expressly drawn attention to them in his letter of 9 November 2012 requesting internal review. The internal review re-examined only the public interest considerations included in the original refusal notice. Mr Gray’s witness statement for the appeal covered the issue of the public interest balance without making any express reference to the possible relevance of disclosure in showing the public whether issues of judicial remuneration were being handled in a manner which would safeguard the quality and independence of the judiciary. It is a matter both of surprise and of concern that the MOJ’s Deputy Director, Judicial Reward and Pension Reform, in post since November 2009, exhibited no appreciation that these were relevant points to consider. These facts seem to indicate within the MOJ a degree of collective blindness to, or unconcern with, the constitutional significance of the arrangements for the protection of appropriate judicial remuneration. 38. The appellant drew attention in addition to the following further matters: 8 Principally in its refusal notice 18 October 2012 and/or in its letter to the Commissioner 12 April 2013 and/or in Mr Gray’s witness statement. - 11 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 a. The wholesale failure to implement SSRB recommendations for several years, with no finite resolution in sight, is a departure from previous practice and undermines its standing and credibility, both in relation to the judiciary and in relation to the other groups within its remit. Appropriate transparency requires that the public should know the full reasons for this failure. b. The public is entitled to know why scarce resources are spent on the SSRB and on evaluation studies, when the results and recommendations are ignored. This is a matter of accountability for expenditure of public funds. c. The ‘significant injustice’ (as he termed it) to Employment Judges, by their being under-graded and hence required to make a disproportionate and unfair contribution to the financial crisis, is contrary to their legitimate expectations. The impact on judicial morale is a matter of public interest. d. The Government’s failure to acknowledge the real difference between a salary increase and the correction of the grading undermines the work of the SSRB across the public sector and is therefore a matter affecting the public interest. Without disclosure of the information, the public remains in ignorance of the reasoning by which the Government concluded that the pay freeze was relevant to and took precedence over the re-grading recommendations. 39. The appellant also contended that accountability in regard to Government decision-making is of increased importance where the approach of the MOJ has been confusing, misleading, or unclear. In this case the CEJ was told at the July 2012 meeting that the SSRB’s recommendations were under consideration and that no decisions had been taken, which, he said, gave a rather misleading impression. 40. We consider that all these matters are of potential relevance, but we think it important to make one qualification and one comment: a. It is necessary to distinguish between the public interest and the private interests of Employment Judges. The appellant submitted in eloquent terms that the group of about 130 individuals affected by the failure to implement the recommendations was entitled to know the reasons for it. While this is a reasonable point, it is no part of our function to say how the Government ought to behave towards particular groups as a good employer. The ‘injustice’ to the Employment Judges, if such it be, is only relevant in so far as it impacts on the general public interest that the judiciary should be properly treated by Government. b. We agree that the MOJ’s position has at times been less than clear, and that the effect of things said or written to the CEJ or the appellant may have been confusing. In part this may be explained by the officials concerned being constrained in what they were able to say. We do have concerns in relation to this aspect, which we record in the Confidential Annex to our decision. (5) Impact of disclosure on the interests served by the s35(1)(a) exemption 41. The MOJ’s refusal notice stated that disclosure would result in civil servants being less inclined to consult with stakeholders on the risks and implications - 12 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 of policy options. We would understand the potential relevance of this to a situation where stakeholders were consulted on a sensitive subject in confidence. This is a valid factor in the present case in relation to the consultations with internal stakeholders, but as regards external stakeholders, it does not seem to us to apply to a material extent in the circumstances of the present case. The principal consultations with those who might be regarded as external stakeholders, of which we are aware in the present case, are (a) the correspondence with the CEJ and the appellant, and the meeting with the CEJ, and (b) consultations with senior judiciary. As to (a), these contacts do not appear to us to have been in circumstances of confidence. As to (b), this is a reference to the expressions of views by senior judiciary, such as the Lord Chief Justice, which were set out as a matter of public record in their submissions to the SSRB. 42. The refusal notice also stated that disclosure ‘could be detrimental to the extent that internal stakeholders would be prepared to make representations and provide advice on matters on which they are often experts, to the overall detriment of the policy development process in this instance’. The reference to internal stakeholders is not explained. We take it to refer to civil servants, such as HMCTS officials, Treasury officials, or officials with relevant responsibilities in other parts of the United Kingdom. They would be expected to contribute their views to the internal policy debate. In principle this seems to us to be no different from the safe space argument for the MOJ’s policy officials’ own deliberations. 43. The MOJ’s main point is that, given the timing of the request, and in the absence of any final decision having been taken, disclosure would intrude on the safe space for policy-making and hence lead to less candid and robust policy discussions. 44. Mr Gray’s evidence on this is partly specific and partly generic. His specific evidence is that it would be ‘impossible’ for officials to offer Ministers advice on choices if the information were subject to full and early disclosure. It would prejudice the formulation of public sector pay policy, of which judicial pay policy is part, and which is yet to be developed. We understand this to be his view, but we consider it to be overstated, for reasons that appear below and in the Confidential Annex. 45. His generic evidence is a recitation of six public interest considerations against disclosure which he says were taken into account9: 46. (1) ‘Disclosure while a policy is in its infancy may be misleading as the final policy may look very different.’ While this could be relevant on different facts, it does not appear to us to be relevant to the matter in hand. 47. (2) ‘Early disclosure of information makes it very difficult to discuss ideas and share thinking. Government is still considering policy options ... ... It is at this point that the public interest in preserving the safe place for policy making is at its highest.’ We agree with Mr Gray and with the Commissioner that this is a consideration which has significant force. 48. (3) ‘Early disclosure may mean a need for MOJ officials to defend everything said to date whether ultimately proceeded with or not, and would hinder the development of actual and effective policy making’. In the particular 9 We assume that we should understand that he agrees with them, although his statement is not explicit on this. - 13 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 circumstances of the present case this appears to us to be a marginal consideration. The pay grading and pay rates of Employment Judges are hardly exciting front page material for the Press. Anything said to date10 which was obviously unsuitable to be taken forward would fall away. In so far as disclosure generated communications relating to viable options, this would involve an additional burden on officials, but this could well be more than compensated for by the benefits to be derived from fuller and franker engagement with responsible external stakeholders. 49. (4) ‘Sharing information and views confidentially across a department is essential to ensuring all relevant policy considerations are taken into account.’ This merely repeats an aspect of consideration (2). 50. (5) ‘Early disclosure of inter-ministerial and senior official discussions has the potential to undermine the collective responsibility of Government Ministers, particularly where this is before a final policy is adopted.’ In the present case this seems to be a purely theoretical point. The general pay freeze policy had already been announced. Section 35(1)(b) is not relied on. 51. (6) ‘The need for Ministers and officials to be able to discuss all policy options in an unrestricted and imaginative way, engaging relevant stakeholders if necessary, and without fear of the list of options being restricted due to public criticism – to do otherwise would be detrimental to the public interest in effective policy making.’ We regard this as effectively a repeat, in different words, of consideration (2). 52. In the circumstances we consider that there are no special or peculiar impacts in the present case; the impact of disclosure on the interests served by the s35(1)(a) exemption boils down to the core point that it would normally be expected that policy regarding the ultimate implementation or otherwise of the SSRB recommendations for re-grading can be more effectively and efficiently made in a safe space away from public view. 53. In its submissions of 8 June 2014 the MOJ states: “The question of public interest must be asked in the round: is there a public interest in withholding the relevant material because its disclosure would have the effect of placing policy deliberations in the public domain before the policy question to which they relate has been resolved?” Having considered the closed materials, the clear answer to this question is in the affirmative, but the critical aspect is the question of the weight of this interest, as compared with the public interest served by disclosure. (6) Impact of disclosure on the interests served by disclosure 54. We have set out above the interests that would potentially be served by disclosure. They can conveniently be gathered into two groups. First, there are the ordinary matters of transparency and accountability of Government, and education and engagement of the public, on the topics in question. These would be materially advanced by disclosure. We understand the MOJ’s position to be that there is no particular need for these ordinary interests to be served during the period when policy is still being formulated. We are inclined to agree. 55. Second, there are the special features which are particular to the present case, which concern the important public interests in the proper functioning 10 meaning up to the time the request was made and dealt with - 14 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 and preservation of the system for judicial remuneration. In relation to the second group, considerations of transparency and accountability could have a particular resonance and force, depending on the view one takes on the extent to which the Government’s conduct, of which the appellant complains, raises questions about the role of the SSRB and the future quality and/or independence of the judiciary. 56. The MOJ submits in its skeleton argument dated 28 November 2013: Notwithstanding the general, indeed constitutional, significance of the importance of the independence of the judiciary, there is no sense in which judicial independence is threatened by the consideration of the SSRB recommendation to date. 57. We see the force of this submission, which is directly contrary to the submissions made by the appellant. We do not understand the Lord Chief Justice, or the SSRB itself, to have taken the view that the failure to implement the recommendations in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 has directly threatened or would directly threaten judicial independence. Nor, as at September 2012, had it directly threatened to undermine the quality of the Employment Judiciary in the short term. However, we do accept (going part of the way with the appellant) that the Government’s decisions not to secure the appropriate value of judicial salary in accordance with recommendations of the independent body appointed to advise on such remuneration raise important questions about possible erosion of the constitutional separation of powers and about the level of the MOJ’s and UK Government’s continued commitment to the Commonwealth Principles on the Accountability of and the Relationship Between the Three Branches of Government (2003). Disclosure would help to answer or at least ventilate these questions. In particular, disclosure would enable the public to know whether or not, or the extent to which, these matters were actively weighed or prominently considered as part of the process of deciding not to implement the recommendations for 2011-2012 and for 2012-2013. 58. On the evidence, the failure to implement SSRB recommendations for several years, or even to promise to implement them as soon as financial conditions permit, is a very significant departure from previous practice, which in our judgment tends to undermine the standing and credibility of the SSRB. This is a serious matter. Recommendation 2 of the 33rd Report was explicit. We acknowledge the qualifications made in Recommendation 9 of the 33rd report, but the view of the SSRB was that the pay freeze did not provide a sufficient reason for non-implementation of the re-grading, as the SSRB complained in paragraph 4.3 of its 34th Report. Appropriate transparency would involve revealing to the public the full reasons for the course of action taken by the Government in this regard. At the time of the request there had been very little by way of public explanation (and this remains the case). 59. Moreover, there is a public interest in fully exposing for public discussion the issue arising from the spending of scarce resources on the SSRB and on evaluation studies, when the results and recommendations are seemingly side-lined by Government. This is a matter of proper accountability for expenditure of public funds. 60. The Government’s practical failure to acknowledge the real difference between a salary increase and the correction of the grading, with the consequent de-motivating impact on a large group of judges, is also - 15 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 something that requires explanation to the public. Disclosure would tend to serve this interest. (7) The public interest balance 61. The question which we have to answer is whether in all the circumstances of the case, at the period when the request was made and the MOJ responded to it, the public interest in maintaining the s35(1)(a) exemption for the disputed information outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information. 62. The MOJ’s own view, supported by Mr Gray’s evidence, is that the balance favours the maintenance of the s35(1)(a) exemption. Given the MOJ’s almost total failure to engage with the constitutional and public interest issues concerning the role of the SSRB and the Government’s response, we can give little weight to the MOJ’s view on where the balance of public interest lies. 63. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in his Decision Notice, was that the timing of the request was a crucial factor. Because of the timing, a significant need for safe space for policy making was demonstrated. This could only be overcome by a compelling public interest in favour of disclosure. The Commissioner accepted that the particular issues related to government pay policy towards the judiciary were of significant public interest, but he considered that they were not sufficiently compelling to overcome the need for safe space. His judgment was that the public interest in enabling the Government to develop its pay policy without significant disruption was the overwhelming factor. Thus the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. On the appeal, the Commissioner originally submitted ‘it was open and reasonable for him to conclude that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption’, and he invited us to dismiss the appeal. These views related to Documents 1-6. 64. The Commissioner’s position changed upon sight of some of the further documents identified in the further searches. He is now of the view that the public interest favours disclosure of some documents and favours maintenance of the exemption in relation to others, depending upon the particular contents of each document. We have dealt with Document 8 in paragraph 4 above. His position on the other more recently identified documents in controversy may be summarised as follows: Doc Maintain or disclose Reasons 7 Maintain exemption Balance favours maintenance of exemption 9 Maintain exemption Balance favours maintenance of exemption 10 Maintain exemption Similar to Doc 1 11 Disclose Because of content, balance favours disclosure 12 Disclose part / For emails, balance is equal, so disclose. Maintain exemption For HMCTS submission, balance favours for part maintenance of exemption 13 Maintain exemption Similar to Doc 10 14 Disclose Balance favours disclosure, both for the emails (2 pages) and the letter of May 2012 (1 page) 15 Maintain exemption Balance favours maintenance of exemption 16 Maintain exemption Balance favours maintenance of exemption - 16 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 17 Maintain exemption Balance favours maintenance of exemption 18 Disclose, subject to Balance favours disclosure of the first 33 a redaction pages of annexes (letter and evidence to go to SSRB), and the 4 pages of letters from the SSRB requesting that evidence, because final version of letter and evidence was published, being in 2012 the same kind of information as was in Doc 8 in 2011. Balance favours disclosure of the submission dated 18.9.12 because the corresponding submission in 2011 was disclosed in Doc 8 and because the submission sets out the approach to be taken in the letter, the final version of which has been published. Redact paragraphs 15 and 16 of the submission. 65. In relation to Documents 11 and 18 the Commissioner has provided specific reasoning in support of his views. Unfortunately, in relation to the other documents, the Commissioner’s position is expressed in terms of conclusions, without any specific supporting reasoning, so we are not able to give much weight to his views in those instances. 66. As regards Document 18, we agree with the Commissioner that there is no justifiable ground for maintaining the s35(1)(a) exemption in relation to the first 33 pages of annexes or the 4 pages of letters from the SSRB: see paragraphs 23-24 above. 67. We are unable fully to endorse his reasoning in relation to the submission dated 18.9.12 which forms the first three pages of Document 18. In our view it does not necessarily follow from the disclosure of the submission contained in Document 8 that the similar submission contained in Document 18 should be disclosed. Nor does this necessarily follow from the fact that the submission sets out the approach to be taken in the letter to the SSRB. While these are matters to take into consideration, the sensitivity of Document 18 has to be considered primarily by reference to its own terms. We note in particular that the contents of the submission contained in Document 18 are less anodyne than the contents of the submission contained in Document 8. 68. The Tribunal has received more evidence than was before the Commissioner when he made his decision, and is entitled to reach its own conclusions as to the facts.11 We have set these out above, and in the Confidential Annex, together with our assessment of the weight of the factors for or against disclosure. These findings go somewhat beyond the matters set out by the Commissioner in his Decision Notice. The public interest balance is a question of mixed law and fact, on which it is for the Tribunal to form a view. 12 In reaching our view, we take into account our assessment of all the factors for or against disclosure and compare the weight on each side of the balance. 11 FOIA s58(2). 12 For the nature of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on appeal, we refer to Guardian Newspapers Ltd and Brooke v IC and BBC EA/2006/0011 and 0013, 4 January 2007, at [14]. - 17 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 69. It seems to us that the real weakness of the MOJ’s case on this appeal is that it has relied mainly on generic considerations about the need for a safe space for policy-making without giving sufficient consideration either to the particular contents of the documents falling within the scope of the appellant’s information request or to the appellant’s weighty points about the particular public interest considerations which are in play. As regards the contents of the documents, this is not a case where the documents contain ‘blue sky thinking’ or specially robust discussion, or where the subject matter registers particularly highly on the scale of possible sensitivity.13 As regards the points made by the appellant, the matters relating to the constitutional and public interest issues concerning the role of the SSRB and the Government’s response are special features which we are persuaded are very weighty. The result is that in the particular and unusual circumstances of the case we find the public interest in disclosure to outweigh the ordinary need for safe space for policy making. This conclusion applies to all the documents to which the s35(1)(a) exemption applies. 70. We give further explanation of our views on the public interest balance in the Confidential Annex. Loss of documents 71. The routine deletion of Mr Rutty’s emails from his email account when he left the MOJ in August 2013 has given rise to some concerns. Ms Hales stated in relation to these: ‘When a member of staff leaves or moves to another department, their email account is emptied. As they will have filed all key documents on TRIM, this is considered to be sensible in order to free up space on the system, and appropriate. At the present time, deleted emails are held in abeyance in a special holding system called E Vault. This is a temporary email holding facility and emails will start to be deleted from this permanently from September 2014. ... Eventually, emails will be permanently deleted upon a member of staff’s departure six weeks after they leave or transfer. 72. The appellant submitted that the risk of loss of evidence, evident from Ms Hales’ statement, was a powerful reason for disclosure in the public interest. 73. In our assessment of the balance of public interest we have not taken this submission into account, because we do not consider it to be well founded. As regards the short term, if information should properly be kept out of the public domain pursuant to a FOIA exemption, the fact that the information may be destroyed is not a good reason for disregarding the exemption. As regards the long term, if information should properly be revealed after its sensitivity has faded, the appropriate answer to this is proper record-keeping, not premature disclosure. If TRIM is properly used, disclosure of key documents in the long term should normally be possible. 74. Where we have a concern in this case is that deletion of Mr Rutty’s emails proceeded even though they were relevant to a current information request 13 We would not wish to be misunderstood as implying that these factors are preconditions for the maintenance of the s35(1)(a) exemption. They are not. We are here concerned with the weighing of a relative balance. Separately, we observe, for what it is worth, that the lines adopted pursuant to the officials’ submissions did not raise any Parliamentary handling concerns or any requirement for Press Office involvement. - 18 -Appeal No.: EA/2013/0127 which had progressed to the Commissioner and the Tribunal and remained unresolved. If the system of permanent deletion six weeks after leaving had been in operation in August 2013, material information would have been lost. The MOJ needs to adjust its procedures for the future so as to ensure that information relevant to unresolved information requests is not deleted, and so as to ensure that none of its employees commits an offence under FOIA s77. Personal data 75. We considered the application of FOIA s40(2) in paragraphs 58-62 of our preliminary decision. None of the parties has made any submissions about the applicability of FOIA s40(2) to the additional Documents 7-18. As before, in the circumstances of the case and for the reasons given we consider it appropriate for the MOJ to redact the names of junior civil servants. This does not include those whose names have been mentioned above in the present decision. 76. We wish to add to the reasoning in paragraph 60 of our preliminary decision. Given the extent to which the legal understanding of what constitutes personal data has developed, we acknowledge that paragraph 19 of Document 1 could be regarded as personal data. If it should be so regarded, we nevertheless remain of the view that paragraph 19 should not be protected by s40(2), because of the legitimate public interest in transparency regarding remuneration of judges and the lack of any expectation that matters concerned with a judge’s salary would remain confidential. Conclusions 77. We conclude for the reasons set out above and supplemented in the Confidential Annex that the appeal should be allowed. 78. After a proper search by the MOJ for documents responsive to the appellant’s information request, the Information Commissioner should have decided that Documents 1-2, 4, 6-7, and 9-18 should have been released in response to the appellant’s information request, on the ground that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the public interest in the maintenance of the exemption in FOIA s35(1)(a). Signed on original: /s/ Andrew Bartlett QC Judge of the Tribunal - 19 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2013/0127 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO DECISION OF 15 SEPTEMBER 2014 This annex is to remain confidential and is not to be disclosed to the appellant or to the public until the time for appeal has expired. If an appeal is made, disclosure must only be made in accordance with further order of the competent court or tribunal. If no appeal is made, the Annex may be released to the appellant and to the public. Questions of scope 1. The closed documents contain discussion of some issues which could arguably be regarded as separate from the matters of interest comprised within the appellant’s information request, such as the specific re-structuring recommendations concerning Upper Tribunal Judges or concerning the office of Presiding District Judge in Northern Ireland. However, as we have stated in our open decision, it seems to us that the scope of information requested concerning consideration of the 33rd and 34th SSRB Reports is necessarily wide, and it would be artificial and misleading to remove the remarks made concerning the position of salaried employment judges from their context. To be more specific: both the broader issues of judicial pay and the particular issues concerning other categories of judge form part of the consideration of the position of employment judges and the recommendations for re- grading them. The similarities to or differences from the positions of other judges form, in our view, part of the overall reasoning. Accuracy of information given by the MOJ to the appellant and others 2. MOJ officials stated to the appellant on 20 April 2012 and at the meeting with the CEJ delegation on 13 July 2012 that the re-grading recommendations were under consideration. The record of the meeting (attended by Messrs Rutty, Gray and Robb)1 makes unhappy reading against the background of what was being said by officials in their private deliberations. It seems to us that Mr Gray’s approach at the meeting was to take refuge in ambiguity, thereby rightly avoiding telling lies, but knowing that things said might be understood in an inaccurate way by the CEJ delegation. 3. In the meeting Christine Lee stated that it seemed that the MOJ was using the pay freeze as an ‘excuse’ for not implementing the re-grading. That perception is largely borne out by the contents of the closed documents, from which in our view it is clear that- a. HMCTS did not want the re-grading implemented because for a variety of reasons it disagreed with it2. b. MOJ policy officials were in apparent agreement with the stance adopted by HMCTS (eg, ‘we would not apply all the recommendations if we were able to do so in public sector pay terms’3). 1 Pages 20-29 of the open bundle. 2 Eg, pp39, 41, 44, 100, 106 of the closed bundle. 1c. These views influenced the advice given by officials to the Lord Chancellor. 4. While the formal line taken each year was that the Government was continuing to consider the re-grading recommendations, the reality shown in the closed documents was that such ‘consideration’ consisted of putting off dealing with them, because their contents were unwelcome. 5. At the meeting Pauline Hughes asked whether there was any prospect that the Government would yet again defer consideration of the recommendations. Mr Gray’s answer was that he would be very surprised if some recommendations were held over for consideration at a later date. But not long afterwards Mr Gray was writing to Emma Lochhead in terms which showed that his expectation was that the Government would not act on the recommendations in the next pay round4. Additional remarks on the public interest balance 6. If the Government takes the view that it can ignore the SSRB’s recommendations, or indefinitely postpone acting upon them, whenever it disagrees with them, the SSRB becomes a pointless body, and a waste of public funds. In our view the public ought to be given information which will help it towards knowing to what extent and within what limits this is the view of Government. 7. The MOJ was well aware of the issue that continued deferment of the question whether finally to accept or reject the recommendations would in practice, over time, amount to rejection of them (eg ‘The ultimate impact of this strategy may well be that the current major review recommendations simply fall away on this occasion. This may, of course, cause concerns for the SSRB and for some judiciary, such as ... [employment judges]’; ‘Not implementing the SSRB recommendations pushes them further into the future and undermines their relevance if we await the lifting of the 1% parameter and I am sure some parts of the judiciary will cry foul in this respect’)5. 8. Despite this awareness, we do not find anywhere in the Closed Bundle any clear recognition or discussion of the possible constitutional significance of (a) a long continued refusal to give a properly considered and transparent response to recommendations made by the SSRB, or (b) a course of conduct which over time would amount in practice to rejection of the recommendations, or (c) a potential formal decision to reject the recommendations outright. 9. By way of example, we find it extraordinary that Mr Rutty’s submission of 18 September 2012 stated at paragraph 9 that ‘the judiciary’ valued the SSRB as ‘an important element in the sensitive balance of relationships between the Executive and the judiciary’, without any recognition that the Executive itself was supposed to be committed to that view or any discussion of the implications of not adhering to it. 10. As set out in paragraph 20 of our preliminary decision, the UK Government has publicly committed itself to the principle of protection of levels of judicial remuneration, in other words, that judicial salaries and benefits should be set by an independent body and their value should be maintained. This commitment has not been evident in the MOJ’s consideration of the recommendations which are the focus 3 Page 101 of the closed bundle. 4 Closed bundle p101, dated 31 July 2012; cf p26 paragraph 23, dated 23 April 2012, which stated: ‘I recommend that a 1% across the board pay increase should be awarded to the judiciary in both 2013-14 and 2014-15, in particular given that: the disadvantages of implementing the major review recommendations would appear to outweigh the disadvantages of not doing so ...’ 5 Closed bundle pp26 and 101 respectively. 2of the information sought by the appellant, or in the Government’s response to those recommendations. 11. In our view it is strongly in the public interest that there should be transparency and accountability on this matter. The public ought to know the nature of the discussion within the MOJ (including with HMCTS), and the minimal extent to which this constitutional principle has formed part of the deliberations and advice to Ministers. 12. Moreover, while it would normally be the case that policy deliberations would be more effectively and efficiently made in a safe space away from public view, it seems to us in the unusual circumstances of this case that transparency is likely to add significant value to the deliberations, by enabling open debate of how the policy questions should be resolved in the light of the constitutional implications of, and reasons for, following or not following the recommendations of the SSRB. In the circumstances we do not accept the view of Mr Gray which is referred to in paragraph 44 of our open decision. 13. The matters in paragraphs 9 and 10 above provide additional support for our finding in paragraph 37 of our open decision concerning the MOJ’s collective blindness to or unconcern with the constitutional significance of the arrangement for the protection of appropriate judicial remuneration. 14. It is right to say that the timing and contents of some of the later documents in the Closed Bundle have caused us to hesitate over the issue of the balance of public interest in relation to those documents. The appellant’s information request was made on 20 September 2012 and dealt with initially by a refusal notice dated 18 October 2012 and later on internal review on 4 December 2012. As an example of our concerns, at the time the request was dealt with the MOJ’s evidence for the SSRB was only in process of being sent to and/or considered by the SSRB, yet the submission of 18 September 2012 contained frank discussion of the policy background to the evidence. There are obvious sensitivities in such a situation, and we consider it would generally be inappropriate for documentation such as the submission of 18 September 2012 to enter the public domain while the SSRB report remained to be finalised and published (which did not occur until a date in 2013). However, upon full consideration, because of the unusual strength of the matters favouring disclosure in this case, we have decided that these sensitivities do not tilt the balance in favour of maintaining the s35(1)(a) exemption. 15. The Information Commissioner submitted6 that paragraphs 15 and 16 of the submission dated 18 September 2012 in Document 18 should be withheld from disclosure, but without giving any reason. Given our views as set out above and in the open reasons, we are not persuaded that any particular paragraphs should be redacted. /s/ Andrew Bartlett QC Judge of the Tribunal 15 September 2014 6 Final Further Submissions by the Information Commissioner, 23 June 2014, paragraph 18. 3"
"67","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2014/0014 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN ANDREW GREEN Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and DEPARTMENT for TRANSPORT Second Respondent Before Brian Kennedy QC Dave Sivers Henry Fitzhugh Representation: For the Appellant: Julianne Morrison of counsel For the Second Respondent: Karen Steyn of counsel Date of Decision: 11th August 2014 Date of Promulgation: 12th August 2014 DECISION The Tribunal refuses the Appeal. We direct that the requested information should not be disclosed and the Closed Bundle should remain confidential.Introduction: [1] The appeal is brought under section 57 of the Freedom of information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The Tribunal and the parties worked from an open Trial Bundle (“OB”) indexed and pagi- nated and from a smaller Closed Bundle (“CB”) also indexed and paginated and authorities bundle AB. [2] The impugned decision under appeal is the Decision Notice (“DN”) from the Respondent dated 4 December 2013: Reference FS50483547. Background: [3] Data on passengers loadings are provided to the Department for Transport (“the DfT”) by Train Operating Companies (“TOCs”), as required by their franchise agreements. Passenger loading information is provided for individual train services by the TOCs. The data, obtained either manually or by automatic counting equipment fitted to the train, shows the number of passengers on board a train at a particular point on its route. [4] On 5 February 2012 the Appellant wrote to the DfT making the following request: “Can you please supply me with the statistics for peak and off peak loadings of rail passengers on the west coast main line?” (“the Disputed Information”). [5] On 2 March 2012 the DfT responded stating that it held the requested information but that it was withholding it under section 43(2) FOIA. [6] The Appellant requested that the DfT carry out an internal review of its decision. On 19 April the DfT advised the Appellant that it was upholding its original decision. [7] The Commissioner then investigated and received sample extracts of the Disputed Information. The DfT also advised that it was seeking to withhold the Disputed Information under section 41 FOIA rather than section 43(2) FOIA. [8] Having taken into account all the arguments raised, in his DN the Commissioner set out his conclusions that: a). The requested information was not”environmental information” as defined under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”) and so it should be assessed under FOIA ( §§24-29 DN). b) The information was exempt information under section 41 FOIA because disclosure would give rise to an actionable breach of confidence ( §§31-98 DN); and c) One specific aspect of the information was exempt under section 21 FOIA because it had been disclosed in open court and recorded in the court judgment( §§99-101 DN) The issues: [9] In his Grounds of Appeal the Appellant asserts that: a) The Commissioner should have found that the information was “environmental information” and so access to it should have been considered under EIR; and b) The Commissioner was wrong to find section 41 FOIA was engaged in this case. These are effectively the issues in this appeal. The relevant Legal Framework:[10] The definition of “environmental information” is at regulation 2(1) EIR and states:”environmental information” has the same meaning as in Article 2(1) of the Directive, namely any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material on:- a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal, and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms,and the interaction among these elements; b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in a); c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in a) and b) as well as measures or activities de- signed to protect those elements; d) reports on the implementation of environmental legislation; e) cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used within the frame- work of the measures and activities referred to in c); and f) the state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures inasmuch as they are or may be affected by the state of the elements of the environment re- ferred to in a) or, through those elements, by any of the matters referred to in b) and c).” [11] Section 41(1) FOIA provides and absolute exemption from the presumed duty of disclo- sure on a public authority for: “Information - - - if- (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (includ- ing another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person.” The Evidence: [12] In addition to the Open and Closed Bundles, the Tribunal had access to evidence from Edward John Palmer (Head of Rail Service Analysis division in the Department for Trans- port) See Tab 7 page 299 (with appendices) and David Blair Mapp (Commercial Director at the Association of Train Operating Companies) See Tab 7 page 294 OB and both witnesses were subjected to cross examination. Conclusion: [13] The Tribunal unanimously agree with the Commissioners’ Decision as per the DN and his reasoning therein. The Appellant has failed to persuade us that the Commissioner was wrong in his conclusions and we endorse and adopt them herein. The appeal is refused. Reasons: [14] We find the first issue at [9] a) above relatively straightforward and unanimously agree that the disputed information is not “environmental information” within the meaning of reg 2(1)(b), (c) or (e) of the EIR. The evidence before us persuades us that on any interpretation the withheld information is not related to “emissions” in any real or meaningful way. We also agree that the information is too far removed from, or related to, and is entirely unconnected to, the HS2 high speed rail project.[15] On our consideration of the content, and the purpose and method of compilation and recording of the disputed information, which is data on the number of passengers using trains, as described by the witnesses, it has no significant or meaningful bearing on, or rela- tion to “emissions”. We find on the facts of this case it bears no relation to “emissions” and accept that it would be erroneous to construe reg 2(1)(b) so broadly as to encompass this information as doing so. [16] The Appellant seeks to rely on the case of Southwark Council V ICO and others EA/2013/0162in which the Tribunal, whilst agreeing that “there may be a tendency to overuse EIR” ( §29), took the view that “the answer to this tendency, it seems to us, is not the development of the vague notion of “remoteness. Rather it lies in the purposive applica- tion to the facts of a case of the definition of “environmental information” in Reg 2(1) EIR ( §30). Our panel member Mr. Fitzhugh was on the Panel in the Southwark case and indicates the subject matter of the disputed information in that case is to be distinguished from this case in that it related to EIR Reg 2(e) on a direct issue on costs benefits. This case on the facts has no such determinative connection. [17] We accept the submission made on behalf of the DfT that the application of the following guidance is of assistance: a) The right of access to “environmental information” is important, but the right only ex- ists if, and to the extent, that the requirements laid down in the Directive and re- flected in the EIR are satisfied. (See Flachglas Torgau GmbH V Germany Case C- 204/09. at AB/2 at( §32.) b) Those requirements will only be satisfied (leaving aside Reg. 2(1)(a), (d) and (f) which are not relied on in this case) if the requested information is properly classified as information on, that is to say, about (i) the factors set out in Reg 2(1)(b); (ii) the measures set out in Reg.2(1)(c); or (iii) cost benefit/economic analyses/assumptions used within the framework of Reg. 2(1)(c) measures. The information must fall within one of those categories. c) Information will not fall within one of those categories if it merely “relates to” or has “minimal connection” to those factors, measures or analyses/assumptions. This, we agree, accords with both the natural and purposive construction. It is our view that the disputed information in this case clearly is not on or about “emissions” nor is it, in our view on the facts before us, in any way relate to or have a minimal connection to “emissions”. [18] On the second issue at [9] b) above, we also find no difficulty in accepting the Commis- sioners conclusion as correct and unanimously reject the appeal in this regard. The Appel- lant has failed to persuade us that the Commissioner was wrong in his interpretation of the application of the exemption under section 41 FOIA. On the contrary the evidence at the oral hearing supports the position taken by the Commissioner in the DN. [19] The Appellants argument that the disputed information is not confidential in that anyone could count the numbers of passengers fails to take into account that the withheld informa- tion is the product of a very precise exercise carried out in the course of a commercial un- dertaking of some magnitude for a particular purpose. We unanimously agree with the Com- missioners’ finding that: “ - - - it is not accessible by other means and given the level of detail in it the data is confi- dential” ( §§38 -62 DN) [20] The evidence from both Mr. Palmer and Mr. Mapp was unambiguous and compelling in persuading us inter-alia that the disputed information is confidential and sensitive material which has the capacity to cause commercial prejudice it released. In particular Mr Palmerdemonstrated how and why the DfT recognise that such detailed and disaggregated data, if released, could be analysed by a competing TOC or other modes of transport operators (he mentioned also airlines) together with information already in the public domain (such as fares) to assess the actual and potential revenues available to each TOC in respect of specific routes and stations at different times of the day, week or year. Furthermore, he ex- plained, competition exists between individual TOCs (giving commercial examples) and the DfT considers that disclosure of the deputed information would cause prejudice to the TOCs, as described by Mr. Mapp. [21] Mr Palmer further described how release of the disputed information would detrimentally and materially affect the DfT relationship with the TOCs and other non-rail private sector organisations. Inter-alia he explained how it would prejudice the DfTs’ own commercial interests and ability to secure value for money for the taxpayer if the DfT was regarded by private sector organisations as being indifferent to protecting their commercial interests. We accept this cogent and pertinent evidence and accordingly are of the view that disclosure of the disputed information would not be in the public interest in all the circum- stances. [22] In the factual circumstances outlined above we find that section 41 is engaged and on the facts of this case and for the reasons given by the Commissioner and through the evi- dence at this hearing the Tribunal has not been persuaded that the Commissioner was wrong in the conclusions reached in his DN and refuse this appeal. [23] The Tribunal do not consider the objective reading of the request needs to be deter- mined in this case as it would not affect the outcome. Obiter we note Section 16(2) FOIA provides that a public authority that conforms with the Code of Practice issued under s 45 is to be taken to comply with the duty to advise and assist.

The Tribunal declares: (1) The Commissioner should not have held that the section 21 exemption applied.Appeal No: EA/2014/0024 (2) The Council did not have a records retention policy relating to child protection records. The Council should have so informed K pursuant to FOIA s1(1)(a). The Council should also have provided to K pursuant to FOIA s1(1)(b) the draft Retention & Disposal Guidelines and Policy Statement. The Commissioner should have so held. No further action is required. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. In this appeal we consider whether the presence of documents on the website of Northumberland County Council (“the Council”) made them “reasonably accessible” within the meaning of the exemption in the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) s21, and whether the particular documents fell within the request that was made. 2. We also qualify the commonly stated proposition that FOIA is applicant blind and motive blind. The request, the public authority’s response, and the complaint to the Information Commissioner 3. In December 2011 the appellant made a request to Northumberland County Council (“the Council”) to delete certain personal data which it held, because he was concerned about data that he believed arose from misuse of child protection powers. Because of this background we have anonymised his identity to “K” in this published judgment. The deletion was resisted by the Council, which in May 2012 made reference to its records retention policy, said to be based on the RGLA 2003. 1 K sought judicial review. The Council’s response to the judicial review proceedings referred to its reliance upon retention periods of certain kinds of records for 35 years or 70 years. In January 2013 K was refused permission by the High Court to proceed to a hearing on the ground that there remained an alternative avenue open to him, which was a request to the Council under s10 of the Data Protection Act. K promptly submitted a s10 request to the Council. The Council refused to comply with the request, claiming that it had revisited its data retention periods, while also offering to destroy documents relating to K’s family 6 years after case closure. 2 1 General Disposal Guidelines for Local Authorities 2003, prepared by the Local Government Group of the Records Management Society of Great Britain. 2 This paragraph reflects information from K. It is not contradicted by information from the Commissioner or from the Council. We record, however, that the Council was not a party to the appeal and made no submissions to us. 2Appeal No: EA/2014/0024 4. K responded to this news by asking the Council on 5 February 2013 (by email) where he could view the Council’s information, record retention and data protection policies. He repeated his request on 12 February 2013 in the following terms: Further to our recent correspondence I wish to make a formal freedom of information request and to formally request sight of the Councils [sic] record management and personal data policies. Given that the information requested is contained within your publication scheme (see below for relevant extracts) I would expect a prompt response to my request ... ...” 5. The extracts indicated that the publication scheme provided access to all the Council’s policy documents, and referred specifically to “Records management and personal data policies”. 6. The Council’s response of 12 March 2013 stated that the Council held “information in relation to the Councils [sic] record management and personal data policies”. It provided its data protection policy but refused disclosure of the records retention policy, relying upon the exemption in FOIA s22 (information intended for future publication), and stating: On balance, as this is a working project and we are currently in the process of completing our Corporate Records Retention guide, we have concluded that the public interest is best served by the planned future publication of the information you have requested and by maintaining the exemption at section 22(1) at this time.” 7. K replied, asking that the Council proceed to internal review, and stating: To avoid confusion could you please confirm that you currently do not have a Corporate Records Retention guide and that you have never had a Corporate Retention Record policy. ... ... It beggar’s [sic] belief that you have an explicit statement on your website, that you will allow access to this information, and when a request is made you refuse to publish the information. Also could you remove this false claim from your website. 8. The internal review response (9 April 2013) reaffirmed that the Council’s corporate records retention guide and policy were under development and maintained the Council’s reliance on the s22 exemption. 9. K complained to the Commissioner. During the Commissioner’s investigation, the Council informed him in late November 2013 that since 2009 the Council had had on its website two draft documents, being a “Records and Information Management Policy Statement” and a “Records Retention and Disposal Policy and Schedule”, and provided links. (The actual title on the front of the latter document is “Retention & Disposal Guidelines for the unitary authority of Northumberland County Council - Draft”. The draft Policy Statement was a short general document which raises no separate issues and we do not need to discuss it.) The Council stated its continued reliance on s22 in relation to these, although it appeared that the draft Guidelines were in fact in use. The Council also explained that new policies were in 3Appeal No: EA/2014/0024 preparation. The data protection and information governance officer stated: “at the time of K’s request we were unaware of the older documents which were on our website”. 10. After some prompting from the Commissioner the two draft documents which had been on the website were provided to K. 11. In his Decision Notice the Commissioner held that at the time of the request the Council had a records retention policy, which was contained in the two draft documents (because, although inadequate and under review, they were available for staff to use), but that the information was exempt under s21 (reasonably accessible by other means) because the documents were available on the Council’s website pursuant to its publication scheme. He further held that the new draft for a revised policy was outside the scope of K’s request, because what K was asking for was the policy that was in actual use. He did not uphold the Council’s use of s22. The appeal to the Tribunal and the questions for the Tribunal’s decision 12. K appeals to the Tribunal. His notice of appeal covers a range of matters, including the data protection aspects which particularly concern him. We confine ourselves to the matters which fall within our jurisdiction. It is not within our statutory remit on this appeal to decide what steps the Council ought to take in order to be in full compliance with its obligations under data protection legislation; our only jurisdiction in this appeal is to consider the Commissioner’s decision concerning the Council’s compliance with the Freedom of Information Act in response to K’s information request. As we understand K’s position on the matters within our jurisdiction, in summary he is contending- a. The Commissioner should not have held that the Council was entitled to refuse the request on the basis of s21 (information reasonably accessible by other means), because the links provided in November 2013 were not available at the time of K’s request. b. More fundamentally, the Commissioner ought to have decided that, despite the assertions made in the publication scheme, the Council did not have a policy of the kind that he was seeking, namely, a policy in relation to Record Retention for Child Protection. The policy was therefore not available under the publication scheme or at all, and s21 has no relevance. 13. The Commissioner contests both of these points. Analysis: accessibility for purposes of s21 exemption 14. There is a dispute of fact between K and the Commissioner over whether the website links (to the incomplete policies that were in use) actually worked at the time when K made his request. This arises because K and the Commissioner place different interpretations on what the Council has said. 4Appeal No: EA/2014/0024 15. We do not consider it is necessary for us to resolve this particular difference of view. This is because, even if valid links existed at the time of the request, we do not consider that in the circumstances of this case such links made the two documents “reasonably accessible” to K. At the time of the request the documents were stored in an obscure part of the website which was difficult to find – so difficult that even the Council itself (including its data protection and information governance officer and the senior officer who dealt with the internal review) was not aware that the documents were accessible via its website, and this fact was only discovered many months later. 16. A well-organised website will normally make documents reasonably accessible to members of the public who are able to conduct web searches. But the circumstances of the present case are not normal in this respect. We therefore disagree with the Commissioner’s application of s21. Analysis: whether the Council held a policy answering to K’s request 17. K contends that it was obvious in the context of his correspondence with the Council that what he was wanting to see was the part of the Council’s records retention policy which dealt with child protection. 18. The Commissioner resists this contention on the ground that a request must be read objectively and is applicant and motive blind. While he concedes that the request commenced with the words “Further to our recent correspondence ...”, he argues that the actual wording of the request was not unclear or ambiguous and that it did not specifically ask for the part of the records retention policy which dealt with child protection. 19. We are aware that it is often stated that the Act itself, or a request under the Act, is ‘applicant and motive blind’, but we consider that this is a misleading oversimplification. It is true in the limited sense that an applicant does not have to demonstrate any particular characteristic or reveal any motive in order to make a valid information request under FOIA. But the identity of the applicant and the nature of the applicant’s motive come into consideration in many different aspects of the application of FOIA to information requests. Where a responsible public interest group makes a request for information, the motives of the group may shed light on the public interest balance under s2. Section 8 requires the applicant’s true identity to be stated. The identities and motives of applicants can be relevant for the purposes of applying the costs limit under s12 (with its applicable regulations) and for the purposes of deciding whether a request is vexatious within s14. An important part of a public authority’s duty under s16 to give advice and assistance may be to find out what the requester is really after, so that advice can be given on how to formulate a request in a manner which will best serve the requester’s purpose or avoid costs limit problems. Under s21 the fact or the degree of accessibility to the particular applicant by other means than FOIA may depend upon the applicant’s personal identity or characteristics. The exemption under s40(1) depends upon the identity of the applicant, and there are various ways in which the exemption under s40(2) may be affected by the purposes for which and circumstances in which the information is sought. 5Appeal No: EA/2014/0024 20. Where an applicant has been in communication with a public authority over matters of concern and then makes a particular information request in writing, there is no principle which requires the request to be divorced from its context. The meaning of the request is the meaning which would be apparent to a reasonable reader in the factual context. In the present case it seems to us to be plain to the reasonable reader that K was asking for the records retention policy which was in use and that what he was particularly seeking was the section that contained the policy on retention of records relating to child protection matters. 21. The draft “Retention & Disposal Guidelines” which were in use at the time of the request contained no guidance on retention of records relating to child protection matters. Whether they amounted formally to a Council policy at all is in our view open to doubt, since they did not have the formal approval required to bring such a policy into force. 22. FOIA s1(1)(a) sets out the right to be informed whether a public authority holds information of the description specified in the request. Section 1(1)(b) sets out the right to have the held information communicated to the requester. In our view, the Council should have answered the information request by telling K pursuant to s1(1)(a) that it understood that what he was particularly seeking was the retention policy relating to child protection records and that it did not have such a policy. It should also have supplied to him the records retention policy that was in actual use pursuant to s1(1)(b). Neither the s21 nor the s22 exemption applied. Conclusions and remedy 23. In our judgment the Decision Notice was not in accordance with law for the following reasons: a. The Commissioner should not have held that section 21 was applicable. b. The Council did not have a records retention policy relating to child protection records. The Council should have so informed K pursuant to FOIA s1(1)(a). The Council should also have provided to K pursuant to FOIA s1(1)(b) the draft Retention & Disposal Guidelines and Policy Statement. The Commissioner should have so held. 24. Since it is now clear that the Council did not hold a records retention policy relating to child protection, and K has received the two draft documents, no remedy is required other than to allow the appeal and declare as above.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. As this appeal comes before us the only issue between the parties is whether a contract made in August 2007 for the purchase by the Appellant, Trinity Housing Association, of certain land (“the Contract”) should have been included in the information disclosed to a member of the public who, in two letters in February and May 2012, had requested information about the transaction which the Contract recorded. In a Decision Notice dated 24 September 2013 the Information Commissioner decided that the Appellant had not been entitled to withhold the Contract and directed that it be disclosed, redacting certain bank account details. The requester had made it clear that he was happy for those details to be redacted but wished to see the whole contract, particularly as certain information about it had been made publicly available by being recorded at the Land Registry. Background 2. In August 2007 the Appellant purchased land and property from a third party. The deal included: a. an undertaking by the vendor to apply for planning permission for that development; and b. an agreement by the Appellant to enter into a negotiated building tender with a third party contractor for the construction of a proposed development. 3. The transaction was recorded in the Contract, which was undated. 4. The Appellant wished to keep the detailed terms of the transaction secret and therefore lodged a summary of it at the Lands Registry, rather than a copy of the Contract.5. In April 2009 the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (“NIHE”) declared that “design and build” arrangements of this type were contrary to procurement law. Subsequently, it called upon the Appellant to repay the funding which it had originally provided to enable the Appellant to acquire the property. This placed the Appellant facing the prospect of litigation with both the NIHE and the original vendor. 6. The request for information was made under Regulation 5(2) of the Environmental Information Regulations (“EIR”). This requires a public authority that holds environmental information to make it available on request. There is no dispute between the parties that the Appellant is a public authority for the purpose of EIR, that the requested information falls within the definition of environmental information and that the original request for information was correctly treated as an EIR request. However, the Appellant argued that it was entitled to refuse to disclose the Contract, relying on the following provisions of EIR: a. Regulation 6(1)(b) (information already publicly available) b. Regulation 12(5)(b) (exception for documents covered by legal professional privilege); and c. Regulation 12(5)(e) (exception for confidential commercial information). 7. We deal with each challenge in turn Does the requested information fall within the exception provided by Regulation 6(1)(b)? 8. The relevant part of the exception reads: “(1) Where an applicant requests that the information be made available in a particular form or format, a public authority shall make it so available, unless- (a)… (b)the information is already publicly available and easily accessible to the applicant in another form or format.” 9. The Grounds of Appeal argued that all the information contained in the Contract, which fell within the meaning of environmental information, had already been made publicly available at the Land Registry and/or had been passed to the original requestor. It was not therefore necessary, it argued, to disclose a photocopy of the Contract itself. We have had the benefit of studying the Contract, which was provided to us on a closed basis. We are satisfied, as a result, that it contains additional information, which has not previously been disclosed. We also accept the Information Commissioner’s argument that the whole of the Contract constitutes environmental information and that it should therefore have been disclosed in its entirety. 10. We therefore reject the Appellants claim that this exception applies.Does the requested information fall within the exception provided by Regulation 12(5)(b)? 11. The relevant parts of EIR Regulation 12 read: (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if- (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. … (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect- (a)… (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature;” 12. The Appellant argued that the Contract was covered by legal advice privilege. The Information Commissioner, while accepting that the language of the exception is wide enough to cover privilege generally, did not accept that the Contract was capable of attracting privilege. He argued that, although the form of a contract may reflect advice given to the parties during its preparation and negotiation, it did not itself constitute legal advice and was not therefore capable of attracting privilege. 13. The Appellant pointed out that the Contract included some manuscript amendments and that their conclusion clearly pointed to advice, presumably the advice that the amendments should be incorporated. 14. The Information Commissioner argued, in his written submissions to us, that the Contract was not a species of document which, once finalised and signed, could attract privilege. We believe that is clearly right. Whatever the position of earlier drafts and written or oral communications about the content of an agreement, or the likely consequences of entering into it, privilege ceases to apply once the parties agree its content and convert the negotiated draft into a final signed document recording the terms of the bargain they have struck. The manuscript amendments, apparently added immediately before signature, are in no different category to the rest of the document in this respect.Does the requested information fall within the exception provided by Regulation 6(1)(e)? 15. The introductory language of Regulation 12(5) is set out in paragraph 11 above. Regulation 12(5)(e) provides a further exception, justifying a refusal to disclose information if to do so would “adversely affect”: “(e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest.” 16. The Information Commissioner accepted that a commercial contract is likely, by its nature, to be confidential, but pointed out that in this particular case some information about it was already in the public domain. He also accepted that the contract formed part of the Appellant’s “commercial activity”. The Appellant argued that its economic interests would be damaged by disclosure because it would provide information to other landowners and developers about its general approach to certain types of contract. However, by the time the request for information had been submitted, in 2012, the NIHE had made its determination that design and build contracts breached procurement law. There was therefore no continuing commercial interest to be protected at the time of the request, since it would not then be possible for the Appellant to enter into further contracts of this nature. 17. The Appellant also argued that it would be harmed by the public becoming aware of the actual or threatened litigation it faced. In particular, it said that any future merger partner would be discouraged from proceeding with the transaction. It also argued that disclosure might make it more difficult for it to obtain planning permission in respect of the property in question. We reject all three arguments. Disclosing the Contract will disclose nothing about any disputes that might have arisen as a result of the Appellant having entered into it. It would not therefore have any effect on the Appellant’s relationship with the public, the planning authorities or any potential merger partner. We find it extraordinary, in any event, that the Appellant would contemplate entering into a merger without disclosing the existence of actual or threatened litigation (assuming that the counterparty did not discover it during the course of pre-contract due diligence). 18. We therefore find that the Appellant has presented no credible evidence that disclosure of the Contract (as opposed to its original decision to enter into it – a matter of public record) should cause any damage to its economic interests. We conclude, therefore, that the exception does not apply. If one or other of the claimed exceptions had applied would the public interest in maintaining it have outweighed the public interest in disclosure?19. Even if we were wrong on the application of the exceptions relied on, we think that the public interest balance, required to be exercised under Regulation 12(1)(b), does not support the maintenance of the exception in this case. There is a public interest in commercial organisations being able to conduct their business in private, although that is heavily diluted where, as in this case, the law requires the publication at the Land Registry of the essential elements of a transaction. The Appellant also argued that disclosure might hamper the activities of the Northern Ireland Audit Office, which was investigating the transaction in question. 20. Against that the Information Commissioner invited us to take into account the public interest in the public being made aware of the content of a contract which fell within a category of arrangement which was now regarded as breaching procurement law. He also argued that disclosure would not have any deleterious effect on the work of the Audit Office. He suggested that the Appellant’s real complaint was that it would prefer not to be subject to what it described as “unwelcome access” to its commercial activities, which was the inevitable result of being categorised as a public authority for the purposes of the environmental information regime. Whether or not that was the Appellant’s motive for refusing disclosure, we find that there is a public interest in disclosure and that the Appellant has failed to demonstrate any significant public interest in maintaining secrecy. 21. We therefore conclude that, even if one or other of the exceptions relied on had applied, the public interest in maintaining the exception would not have outweighed the public interest in disclosure. Conclusion 22. The Appellant was not entitled to refuse to disclose the Contract in response to the original information request and its appeal against the Decision Notice should therefore be dismissed. 23. Our conclusion is unanimous. Chris Ryan Judge 6th May 2014"

REASONS FOR DECISION Background to the two appeals 1. The Appellant, Mr S Johnson, made two separate requests for information from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) – containing a number of individual questions – during 2012. 2. In the first, on 5 November 2012, he asked for information contained in 17 separate questions. The request concerned two areas: a visit by DWP fraud staff to a particular job centre and about G4S staff at Jobcentres. 3. In the second, on 1 October 2012, he asked for information contained in 52 separate questions. The requests concerned a number of issues grouped under headings relating to the DWP’s policies about or information on: (1) Signing off of jobseekers’ allowance. (2) Formal complaints. -2-Appeal Nos. EA/2013/0229 and 0232 (3) Work programme. (4) Contact by Jobcentre. (5) JSA sanctions. (6) Jobcentre Plus Staff - SE Wales Region. (7) Pontypool Jobcentre. 4. In each case the DWP refused to respond citing the provisions of s.14 FOIA 2000 and in each case the Information Commissioner concluded that the DWP were correct to do so. The appeal to the Tribunal 5. Summarising the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal, in respect of both matters, he believed that: <U+F0B7> He had every right to ask the questions and have answers to them and had no desire or intention to be vexatious. <U+F0B7> His questions were genuine and related to real events. The fact that they related to ongoing complaints and issues should not deny him access to the information. <U+F0B7> The public interest in enquiring about DWP processes – which involved public money – required answers. <U+F0B7> It was of concern that unknown DWP staff could sit on appointments without prior warning or consent. <U+F0B7> He had witnessed G4S staff acting – apparently – as Jobcentre Plus employees on the front desk, dealing with appointments and directing clients. He was concerned that they had inappropriate access to private and confidential information, breaching data protection principles. <U+F0B7> Inappropriate factors had been used by the DWP and the Information Commissioner to find his requests vexatious. <U+F0B7> The questions were easy to answer and had a serious purpose and value. His “real and relevant questions” were not disproportionate or unjustified and were highly 'valuable' and significant as nationally the types of issue were key to how DWP operated in the public interest. -3-Appeal Nos. EA/2013/0229 and 0232 <U+F0B7> The Information Commissioner’s “so-called” new guidance was invalid. <U+F0B7> The Information Commissioner had condoned and endorsed derogatory statements about him. He felt he was due a large amount of compensation for the hurt and distress he had been caused. <U+F0B7> He had carefully grouped his requests into relevant areas rather than making generalised requests. 6. The Appellant repeated these complaints to the Tribunal during the oral appeal hearing. The Information Commissioner did not attend that hearing and relied on earlier written submissions. 7. Ahead of that hearing he had been provided by the Tribunal with a copy of the Upper Tribunal decision in Dransfield. He did not believe that any of the factors identified in that decision properly could be used to characterise his behaviour in either of the appeals. The questions for the Tribunal 8. Were the Appellant’s requests for information in respect of each of these appeals properly refused because they were vexatious by virtue of s.14 FOIA? Conclusion and remedy 9. In respect of the issues in the first appeal the Tribunal finds that, while there might be serious issues in relation to the purpose and value of the information requested, they have been clouded by the Appellant’s (admitted) private concerns and do not reflect matters of wider public interest. 10. The Appellant has produced no evidence of any wrongdoing occurring at the DWP offices or any fraud. Objectively this severely limits the purpose and value of the information requests when weighed in the -4-Appeal Nos. EA/2013/0229 and 0232 context of the impact on the public authority and the distress, disruption or irritation that would be incurred by complying with these requests. 11. In terms of the burden placed on the DWP it is quite legitimate for the history and the number of requests to be considered in the context of vexatiousness. 12. A detailed chronology has been provided about the Appellant’s contacts, correspondence, complaints and requests. Although the Appellant disputes the way in which some of these have been characterised he had produced no evidence that the matters set out at Annex1 (Mr Johnson – complaints – correspondence) and Annex 2 (Stephen Johnston – FoI requests) are incorrect. 13. Annex 1 covers the period from 16 September 2009 and involves 79 entries from that date until 16 January 2013. Annex 2 covers the period from 13 October 2011 to 13 February 2013, covers 11 A4 pages and 10 individual sections. 14. The Appellant asked 120 questions in 5 separate requests over a 13- month period. The Tribunal is satisfied from the information provided - and not substantively contradicted during the appeal hearing - that the Appellant has written to different individuals or departments on the same day about the same issue making responses difficult to co- ordinate. 15. The Tribunal finds that this activity has taken up a disproportionate time, diverting the resources available to the DWP to deal with other matters. Compliance with the Appellant’s continued requests would cause significant disruption to its usual course of business and be unduly burdensome in respect of the deployment of its resources. 16. In terms of harassment of - and distress to – staff, the sheer volume of the Appellant’s activities noted at Paragraphs 12 - 14 above provide -5-Appeal Nos. EA/2013/0229 and 0232 objective evidence of the likelihood of that. It is understandable that staff would feel intimidated and reluctant to deal with the Appellant because to engage with him was to invite additional correspondence and complaints about his issues. 17. In respect of the issues in the second appeal – the 52 requests relating to Jobcentre Plus made on 1 October 2012 – again the Tribunal finds that these were disproportionate and would create an unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. They focus on his issues with Jobcentre Plus. 18. In terms of the burden on the DWP, and in addition to these 52 requests, the Appellant made 69 FOIA requests in four submissions and 14 subject access requests under the Data Protection Act 1998. Between submitting the instant 52 requests and these being refused he submitted a further 17 FOIA requests. 19. The information requests in both of these appeals have been properly characterised as vexatious and the DWP and the Information Commissioner were correct to characterise them in the way that each did. 20. For all these reasons the Tribunal finds that both appeals fail. 21. Our decision is unanimous. 22. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 22 April 2014 -6-"

REASONS FOR DECISION Summary 1. We have decided that information held by the Appellant (“the School”) regarding the results of its entrance tests had been sufficiently anonymised that it did not constitute the personal data of those who took the tests. The information is not therefore capable of falling within the exemption from disclosure provided by section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) (third party personal data whose disclosure would breach data protection principles). We have also concluded that the information did not fall within the exemption provided by FOIA section 43 (prejudice to the School’s commercial interests). We therefore reject the School’s appeal. The Request for Information 2. On 21 January 2013 the Second Respondent, Mr Coombs, wrote to the School requesting various elements of information regarding the School’s entrance tests. The requests included the following: “I would also like anonymised copies of the full test results (just the normalised scores for each test and the age weighting) for the last three years in electronic format”. We will refer to this information as the Disputed Information. 3. The request constituted a request for information under FOIA section 1, which imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as absolute or qualified. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemptionis found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 4. Although the School disclosed some information to Mr Coombs it claimed that the Disputed Information constituted the personal data of the individual children who had sat the relevant tests. The School therefore argued that complying with that part of the request would involve it in a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”), with the result that the information should properly be treated as exempt information under FOIA section 40(2). The law relied on by the School during the Information Commissioner’s investigation 5. FOIA section 40(2) provides that information is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of a third party the disclosure of which would contravene any of the data protection principles set out in Schedule 1 of the DPA. 6. Personal data is itself defined in section 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) which provides: “’personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller” Complaint to the Information Commissioner and his Decision Notice 7. Mr Coombs complained to the Information Commissioner about the manner in which his request had been handled by the School and, following an investigation, the Information Commissioner issued a Decision Notice on 31 October 2013. The only part of the Decision Notice that we are concerned with is the Information Commissioner’s decision that the School had not correctly applied FOIA section 40(2) and his direction that it disclose the Disputed Information to Mr Coombs within 35 days. 8. The basis of the Information Commissioner’s decision was that the Disputed Information did not fall within the definition of personal data because, although it clearly related to living individuals, it was anonymised to a degree that meant that it was not reasonably likely that an individual could be identified from it. It was not therefore necessary to consider the application of the data protection principles.9. The Information Commissioner reached his conclusion on anonymisation notwithstanding erroneously concluding that the Disputed Information included the dates of birth of each test candidate. In fact Mr Coombs had asked for the data to include the “age weighting”, but not dates of birth. The “age weighting” is a number, based on the month of birth of each candidate (but not the day of the month). It is used in an attempt to balance the scores achieved by those who may be expected, by virtue of a birth date early in the academic year, to be more advanced than those born later in the academic year. The Appeal to this Tribunal 10. The School lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice on 26 November 2013. 11. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 12. The Grounds of Appeal challenged the conclusion, recorded in the Decision Notice, that the Disputed Information had been sufficiently anonymised to prevent the individuals who sat the exam being identified from a combination of the Disputed Information and other available information. Two elements of additional information were relied on. First, that available on a public forum contributed to by certain parents of children who took the entrance tests or might be candidates in the future. Some parents published on the forum sufficient information about their child’s performance on the test that the individual child could then be identified from the Disputed Information. The School annexed to its Grounds of Appeal copies of certain entries on the relevant forum, in which parents had set out information about a child, together with the results sheet for the 31 candidates who sat the Boarding Applications test for entry in 2013. The results sheet showed, underlined, two individuals who, it said, could be identified as a result. 13. The second element of information that the School said would enable individuals to be identified was information previously disclosed to Mr Coombs regarding the formula for age weighting. It was said that this would enable him to work out from the Disputed Information the months and years of birth of each child whose result was listed, which could lead to the identification of one or more individuals.14. The School argued that disclosure of the Disputed Information in response to the information request would be unfair to the individuals who took the test and would therefore breach the data protection principles. 15. The Grounds of Appeal also included a complaint by the School that release of partial data would be confusing and misleading to the public and that Mr Coombs was likely to use the data out of context as part of a vendetta which it was said he was conducting against the School. Neither of those arguments has any relevance to the central question of whether the Disputed Information constitutes personal data, although they might come into play in the event that we were to decide that personal data should be disclosed and that the impact of the data protection principles therefore required to be considered. 16. Of greater relevance to the outcome of the appeal, the School also used the Grounds of Appeal to introduce a new ground for refusing disclosure. This was said to arise under FOIA section 43(2) (release of information likely to prejudice commercial interests). We have taken this ground of appeal into consideration notwithstanding the fact that it was not relied on during the Information Commissioner’s investigation. 17. The parties were content for the appeal to be determined on the papers, without a hearing, and we agree that it is a suitable case to be resolved in that way. 18. We deal with each of the grounds of appeal in turn. Does the Disputed Information constitute the personal data of those who sat the School’s entrance tests and, if so, would its disclosure breach data protection principles? 19. The Information Commissioner’s response to the arguments set out in the Grounds of Appeal was as follows. He correctly identified that the task facing this Tribunal, in deciding whether or not the Disputed Information constituted personal data, is to determine whether, on the facts, the Disputed Information is truly anonymised. He relied on the decision of the High Court in Department of Health v Information Commissioner [2011] EWHC 1430 (Admin) as interpreted and applied by the Upper Tribunal in Information Commissioner v Magherafelt DC [2012] UKUT 263 (AAC). He accepted that this required an assumption that some members would (be motivated to) try to get information they did not already have to combine with the anonymised data in order to identify individuals. He argued, however, that the steps taken by contributors to the online forum relied on by the Appellant to publicise information about some of those taking the tests did not undermine the anonymisation of the Disputed Information. First, he argued, it had been accepted by the Appellant that individuals who had not had details posted on the public forum would not be identified and, secondly, the Appellant’s own evidence indicated that those who hadcontributed information had used a pseudonym. It followed, he said, that whilst the parent who had created a post would be aware that it related to his or her child, another member of the public would not be able to combine the information with any part of the Disputed Information in order to identify him or her. 20. In the case of parents or teachers, who would have prior knowledge of the test performance of one or more individuals, the Information Commissioner invited us to conclude that this was sufficient, on its own and without being combined with the Disputed Information, to identify an individual and that it was not likely that they would disclose any part of the information to third parties seeking to penetrate the anonymised data. 21. Finally, the Information Commissioner argued that Mr Coombs’ knowledge of the formula for age weighting did not lead to identification, although he conceded that it might enable anyone with that information to calculate a birth date and, by inference, to reduce the number of possibilities. Mr Coombs supported this part of the Information Commissioner’s case, by reference to specific examples of information posted on the forum, although the greatest part of the written submissions filed by him, concentrated on a number of complaints about the School and its entrance test procedures, which are not relevant to the anonymisation issue. 22. In its Reply submission the School supplemented its Grounds of Appeal with a challenge to the argument that those with prior knowledge, enabling them to identify an individual, were limited to people with a close connection to that individual. It cited others who might know an individual’s birth date (as a result, for example, of being a class-mate or having read an individual’s social network publication) and who, it said, would be able to use that information to identify an individual from the Disputed Information. The School accordingly maintained its argument that it was not only the parent, close friend or teacher of an individual who would be able to identify a pupil but any other “motivated intruder”, who had some prior knowledge of the individual. 23. Applying to the facts of this case the authorities to which we have been referred we believe that the rules we should apply are: (i) information which is sufficiently anonymised before disclosure will not amount to personal data at the moment of disclosure even though the data in its original format retained by the School continues to fall within the definition of personal data; (ii) the anonymisation will be sufficient if living individuals cannot be identified from the Disputed Information when considered with other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the intended recipient as a member of the public; and(iii) in considering what additional information is likely to be available, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used in order to acquire that additional information. 24. The facts of the Magherafelt case, referred to above, were that the requested information (regarding disciplinary action taken against employees of a relatively small local authority) was likely to be of interest to investigating journalists and that there was likely to be a considerable body of circumstantial evidence for them to explore among fellow employees and inhabitants. In the present case, despite Mr Coombs’ concerns about the overall operation of the School’s entrance tests, it seems unlikely that individual test scores would attract the same degree of interest or that anyone carrying out an investigation would find an available source of additional information outside that dispersed among the family and friends of each of the large number of children who attempted the test. We take that assessment into account in proceeding to consider the likelihood of information coming into the possession of a recipient of the Disputed Information, which would enable an individual to be identified. 25. The examples of available sources of additional information suggested by the School do not lead, in our view, to a likelihood of the anonymisation being penetrated. We take each in turn: a. Parents and close family members will be aware of all the information in the original data, insofar as it relates to their particular child or family member. There will therefore be no information about their own family member for them to seek in the Disputed Information and no information in their possession to enable them to identify the child of any other family whose test results appears in the Disputed Information. b. Teachers may know how well individual applicants performed in a test. However, they will have come into possession of that knowledge as employees of either the School or another institution, which the applicant attended at the time of sitting the entrance test. In the first case it is not information additional to the Disputed Information but is the same information, in its pre- anonymisation form, which will continue to be treated as personal data in the possession of the employer. In the second case, the teacher of an individual applicant for a place at the School, will be in the same position as a parent, knowing both name, month of birth and test result. c. Those reading information posted on the forum will acquire no relevant information from messages uploaded under a pseudonym – even if date of birth and/or test results were to be published this will take the reader no closer to an individual’s identity, beyond that the child’s family member operates under a particular pseudonym. Even if the contributor gave his or her full name it would be that publication alone which identified theindividual and not the combination of published data and Disputed Information. d. As to other individuals, whilst it is conceivable that some may have assembled information about an individual’s month of birth and school tests being attempted, this could only be combined with the Disputed Information to identify that individual’s score, if they knew the scores of all the other candidates in the same “month band” which on average was about 50 candidates for the normal test, to enable a process of elimination to take place. We regard the likelihood of that as far too remote to satisfy the test we have identified in paragraph 23 above. 26. Although the request was for 3 years data, only that pertaining to the 2012 test was provided to the Tribunal. We noted that in that year there were 6 candidates who took the test late (in January 2013). The test scores for these candidates were not included in the disputed information provided to the panel. In 4 of those cases they were the only candidate in their relevant age band. Therefore if the data for those candidates is presented separately it would be possible for those individual’s scores to be identified but only by someone who knew from other sources both their month of the birth and the fact that they had taken the test late. Again, we consider that this combination of circumstances is too remote to satisfy the test of likelihood of availability test. 27. We conclude, therefore, that disclosure of the Disputed Information is not reasonably likely to result in a recipient being able to combine it with other information he or she holds and in that way to identify one or more of the individual’s whose test results appear in the Disputed Information. The Disputed Information does not therefore consist of or contain personal data. It is not therefore necessary for us to proceed to the second part of the enquiry – disclosure possibly breaching data protection principles. The result is that the Disputed Information does not fall within the exemption provided by FOIA section 40(2). Disclosure likely to prejudice the School’s commercial interests under FOIA section 43(2) and the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 28. FOIA section 43(2) reads, in relevant part: “Information is exempt information if its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (including the public authority holding it). 29. The exemption is a qualified exemption so that, if it is engaged, the public interest test falls to be taken into consideration in order to determine if it should be disclosed.30. In its Grounds of Appeal the School asserted that release of the scores achieved on the test would have a prejudicial effect on the commercial value of the assessment and its value as a research tool for the School. In particular it suggested that members of the public, including tutors, could reverse engineer the data to calculate the number of questions under each assessment criteria and in that way provide an unfair advantage to certain candidates. It was said that for a selective school release of the data contained in the Disputed Information would severely prejudice the effective administration of the admissions process and undermine the validity and accuracy of the selection process. 31. The Information Commissioner argued in his Response first, that the School had not demonstrated that it had an interest in the Disputed Information which could properly be described as “commercial”. In addition, he argued that the School had failed to demonstrate that any commercial interest which did exist would be prejudiced by disclosure. 32. The School sought to clarify its case in its written submission in reply. It asserted that: i. It had a commercial interest in the admissions procedure because it had been developed internally and disclosure would enable others to adapt and use it, thus benefitting from the School’s expertise and experience and prejudicing the School’s ability to sell the procedure, should it wish to do so in the future; ii. Tutors would be able to calculate the number of questions for each specific skill being tested and work out a “pass rate” which would unfairly advantage their clients and disadvantage others; iii. Reverse engineering of the data in this way would undermine the selection process, which was crucial to a selective school, and would force the School to outsource the entrance tests at considerable expense; iv. The Disputed Information had been seen by the Education Funding Agency, which governs Academies on behalf of the Department for Education and had found the School’s admissions process to be compliant. 33. The School failed to make out its case under i.- iii. above. Regarding (i) the disputed information contains no information about the tests used and the age weighting formula has already been released. Regarding (ii) the number of questions was of course known by all candidates who sat the test and the “pass score” is in any case communicated to the parents of all applicants. It is unclear how the “pass rate” could be calculated, and, even if it could, how that could unfairly advantage the clients of tutors. Regarding (iii) there is no apparent reason whyrelease of the disputed information would require the school to outsource its tests. In summary, the School neither explained how the Disputed Information, on its own, would enable others to gain an unfair advantage nor supported with any credible evidence its assertions as to the way in which that was likely to cause it commercial harm. Its final point iv. has no relevance to the issue, although it might have been a relevant consideration if it had become necessary to carry out a public interest balancing test. However, the School has not made out its case that the exemption is engaged and it is accordingly not necessary for us to consider that test. 34. We should make it clear that, in theory, the disadvantages which the School said it would suffer are capable of constituting a commercial interest. However, for the reasons given, the School has simply failed to establish a case, on the facts, that those disadvantages are likely to accrue in the event that we order disclosure of the Disputed Information. Conclusion 35. In light of our findings above we conclude that the School was not entitled to refuse disclosure of the Disputed Information, that the Information Commissioner was therefore right in the conclusion he reached in his Decision Notice and that the Appeal should therefore be refused both for the reasons given in the Decision Notice and, in respect of FOIA section 43, the reasons set out above. 36. We reiterate that the Disputed Information to be disclosed includes age weighting but not the dates of birth of those who took the School’s tests (see paragraph 9 above). 37. Our decision is unanimous. ……….. Chris Ryan Tribunal Judge 15th April 2014 Promulgated on 16th April 2014"

Dated this 11th day of December 2013 Judge Hughes [Signed on original] 3Appeal No: EA/2013/0141 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Mr Davis is a leaseholder in the Isles of Scilly. He wishes to enfranchise his lease but is unable to do so because his landlord is the Prince of Wales. He raised his concerns with government departments in 1998 and since then he has pursued the matter through various means. The request for information 2. On 9 April 2012 Mr Davis wrote to the Department for Communities and Local Government and requested information:- “…it is requested that in the public interest, full disclosure of all information and communications between the Government and their advisors and the Prince of Wales and his advisors be made in his role as a land owner on the exemptions appertaining to the Duchy of Cornwall and the Leasehold Reform Acts from 1967 to 2002.” 3. The Department responded on 7 August 2012. It provided one letter, relied on the exemption in S21 FOIA for other material (the material was reasonably available to Mr Davis having been previously supplied to a campaign group with which he was associated) and for other documents it had identified relied on S37(1)(aa) (information relating to communications with the heir to the Throne) and S41(1) (information in confidence). 4. Mr Davis complained to the Information Commissioner who on 11 June 2013 issued a decision notice upholding the refusal to provide the information by reason of the exemption in S37(1)(aa). Having made this determination he did not then consider the application of S41(1). The appeal to the Tribunal 5. In his appeal and his written and oral submissions Mr Davis set out in detail the history of the landholding in this part of the Scilly islands and his attempts to understand the position and obtain the enfranchisement of his lease. He was critical of the actions of Government and the non-availability of papers. 4Appeal No: EA/2013/0141 6. He stated that disclosure was in the public interest “and I am the public” in particular as he wanted to know how the Duchy had persuaded the Government to grant the exemption from the Leasehold Reform Act as detailed in the voluntary undertaking which explicitly exempted properties on the Garrison, St Mary’s. Mr Davis had understood that when the 1967 Act was passed the Duchy whilst not covered by the Act had agreed on a voluntary basis to comply with the Act subject only to some minor exemptions, he was critical of what he saw as secrecy in the widening of those exemptions to included his property. He felt that he had a normal contract (i.e. rights under the Leasehold Reform Act) and he should have been treated fairly by being consulted before his contract was changed. He felt that commitments given to abide by the provisions of the Leasehold Reform Act had been reneged on. He had 46 years left of his lease and was financially disadvantaged should he ever wish to sell it. 7. In the Tribunal he argued that the request went back to 1998, before FOIA and before the amendment to FOIA contained in S37(1)(aa) and that therefore the FOIA exemption did not apply to his request as it predated the amendment – that argument was not made in his notice of appeal. 8. Mr Davis told the Tribunal that although the lease “says the Prince by his full name, I take the point the lease does not simply say Duchy of Cornwall, it gives the leaseholder his full titles.” He argued however that the Prince of Wales was a ceremonial title with no powers, whereas the Duchy of Cornwall role was very different. The Prince, in his role as the Duke of Cornwall, had a functional role as Chairman and Trustee of the Duchy which was a private estate. In considering the case it was appropriate to split off the functional from the ceremonial roles as, in his view, the exemption from FOIA applied only to the ceremonial role, or in any event did not apply to his role as Duke of Cornwall. He acknowledged that the Prince of Wales took an active role in the administration of the Duchy of Cornwall. The questions for the Tribunal 9. The simple question for the Tribunal was whether the decision notice issued by the Information Commissioner was in accordance with the law in the light of the facts of the case. The issues raised by Mr Davis are that S37(1)(aa) was not applicable at the date of the request, that S37(1)(aa) permits the disclosure of some information, that it is in the public interest to disclose the information and that the circumstances of the 5Appeal No: EA/2013/0141 case mean that the claim for the confidentiality of the information should not be upheld. The date of the request 10. Although Mr Davis did not raise the issue in his appeal in the hearing he put forward the argument that there had been an on-going request for information since 1998 and therefore the amendment to FOIA to insert S37(1)(aa) did not apply to this request since the request had been in existence when FOIA did not contain this provision and therefore the information should be provided. 11. This argument is untenable on a number of grounds. The facts are simple. While in his letter dated 9 April 2012 he referred to the previous history, he formulated a specific request for information in that letter and complained to the Information Commissioner about the Department’s response to that letter. The letter is the request for information and was made after the amendment to FOIA. The applicable law is FOIA as amended by the insertion of S37(1)(aa). Whether a ceremonial/functional split is possible 12. S37 provides:- (1) Information is exempt information if it relates to- (aa) communications with the heir to, or to the person who is for the time being second in line of succession to, the Throne 13. The request for information may be appropriately analysed in two parts. The information is identified as information and communications between… and the Prince of Wales and his advisors. The request therefore relates to the heir to .. the Throne. 14. The request however seeks to limit the request by reference to his role as the land owner. The difficulty for Mr Davis is there is no such distinction in the statute. While as Shakespeare wrote each man in his time plays many parts; these parts are all part of the whole history and life of the man. The Prince of Wales has many roles some personal, some related to his public role. FOIA does not distinguish between these roles; information relating to all of these roles are protected from disclosure under FOIA because they all relate to communications with the heir.... to the Throne. 6Appeal No: EA/2013/0141 15. It is therefore not possible under FOIA to split certain roles with part being susceptible to FOIA and others not. The statutory wording is unambiguous. Public interest 16. The general right of public access to information under FOIA is contained in S1:- 1 General right of access to information held by public authorities. (1)Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— …… (b)if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. 17. However the effect of exemptions in FOIA is set out in S2. This provides:- (2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— (a)the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (3)For the purposes of this section, the following provisions of Part II (and no others) are to be regarded as conferring absolute exemption— ….. (ea)in section 37, paragraphs (a) to (ab) of subsection (1), 18. Therefore S37(1)(aa) FOIA is an absolute exemption; that means that if it applies there is no obligation on the public body receiving the request, the Information Commissioner or the Tribunal to consider and weigh the benefits of disclosing the information because there is no entitlement on the part of Mr Davis to have the information disclosed to him. Confidentiality 19. In the light of the clear statutory exemption from disclosure it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the application of the exemption in S41. 7Appeal No: EA/2013/0141 Conclusion 20. For the reasons stated above we dismiss the appeal and find that the Information Commissioner’s decision notice was in accordance with the law. 21. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 11 December 2013 8"
"73","Procedural Refusal","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Information Rights Tribunal Reference: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Respondent: The Information Commissioner Second Respondent: M McDermott Third Respondent: The Attorney General for Northern Ireland Judge: NJ Warren Member: D Stephenson Member: D Sivers Hearing Date: 29 October 2013 Decision Date: 13 November 2013 DECISION NOTICE A. Background 1. In 1985 the United Kingdom (UK) introduced a ban on blood donation by men who have had, at some time in their lives, sex with another man. On 8 September 2011 following an expert review it was announced that in England, Scotland and Wales the ban would be modified with effect from 7 November 2011. It would no longer apply to men who had not had sex with men in the previous year. The minister at the Department of Health and Social Security and Public Safety (DHSSPS) Mr Poots, decided to maintain the status quo in Northern Ireland. 2. This led to the threat of judicial review and DHSSPS received pre-action protocol letters dated 27 September 2011 and 1 November 2011. In October 2011 DHSSPS received advice from the Attorney General for Northern Ireland (“the Attorney General”) about the matter. On 26 October 2011 there was a session of theDecision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 Committee for Health Social Services and Public Safety of the Northern Ireland Assembly which received evidence from interested parties including Mr Poots. In November 2011 someone to be known in accordance with a High Court order for anonymity as JR65 applied to that Court for permission to bring an action for judicial review. 3. A couple of months later, on 8 February 2012, Mr McDermott from the Rainbow Project, who had been amongst those giving evidence to the Assembly committee, sent a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to DHSSPS. We are concerned only with the part of that request which asks for:- “ … a copy of the advice received by the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety from the Attorney General for Northern Ireland in respect of the lifetime ban on men who have sex with men from donating blood in Northern Ireland.” 4. The Department refused the request and on 5 May 2012 Mr McDermott complained to the Information Commissioner (ICO). In June 2012 permission for the judicial review action was granted. On 25 March 2013 the ICO issued a decision notice requiring DHSSPS to disclose the withheld information. There is now before us an appeal by DHSSPS against that decision notice. The High Court decision on the judicial review application was delivered on 11 October 2013. Treacy J held that it was open to Mr Poots to regard the risks to be so high that a lifetime ban remained appropriate. On the other hand, it was irrational for Mr Poots to, at the same time, permit imports of blood from the rest of the UK. In any event, the High Court concluded that the power to make a decision on this issue lay with the Secretary of State in London. If the decision had lain with DHSSPS then the Minister would have been bound first to refer the issue to the Executive Committee. B. The hearing 5. We heard this appeal at Belfast on 29 October. DHSSPS were represented by Mr Sharpe. The ICO was represented by Mr Hopkins. Mr McDermott was represented by Mr McQuitty. The Attorney General, who had been joined as a 2Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 party was represented by Mr Wimpress who also placed before us a written submission from Mr Huckle QC who is Counsel General to the Welsh Government. We express our thanks to all of these for their written submissions and, to those who appeared, for their oral argument. 6. The Tribunal registrar had authorised a closed bundle to be prepared for the hearing consisting of the disputed information and a confidential annex to the ICO decision notice. We needed to see the disputed information in order to reach a fair decision. To disclose it beforehand would defeat the purpose of the proceedings. We had to see the confidential annex because we were hearing an appeal against the whole of the ICO decision notice. We were satisfied that the annex described the advice and discussed arguments so intricately involved with the advice that to reveal the annex would also defeat the object of the proceedings. 7. At the start of the hearing, Mr McQuitty proposed that the closed bundle be disclosed to himself on his undertaking to treat it as confidential. We refused the application because we were satisfied that we could properly carry out our task without disclosing the material to Mr McQuitty. See Browning v ICO and DBIS (2013) UKUT 236 (AAC). 8. To assist us in this, we received a list of issues or questions from Mr McQuitty. It was also relevant that this was a case in which the ICO had seen the closed material; would be present at any closed part of the hearing; and would be arguing for the same result as MrMcQuitty. 9. Towards the end of the hearing the three other advocates invited us to hold a short closed hearing and we did so. When it concluded we explained in open court what had happened. We had been through the questions that Mr McQuitty had left for us. Of these , numbers 4 and 5 could not be answered because they referred to the DHSSPS request for advice, which had not been requested and we had not seen. We had listened to submissions which pointed to elements of the closed material as examples of arguments which had already been aired in open session. We had also been asked by the ICO to consider the extent to which the advice was firm. 3Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 10. DHSSPS and the Attorney General both submit that the requested information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. They point to three categories of exempt information in the Act:- (a) Section 35(1)(a) which deals with the formulation or development of government policy. (b) Section 35(1)(c) which deals with the provision of advice by the Attorney General or any request for the provision of such advice. (c) Section 42 which deals with information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege (LPP) could be maintained. 11. These exemptions are not absolute exemptions. They apply if or to the extent that “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the exemption”. This is often referred to as the public interest balancing exercise. Something should be said about the manner in which the ICO asks us to carry this out. 12. In short he asks us to carry out three balancing exercises, not one. In his own decision notice, he takes first the LPP exemption (paras 12-27) and concludes that whilst the judgement is a finely balanced one, the public interest in maintaining the LPP exemption does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. There follows (paras 28-48) a discussion of the exemption relating to formulation and development of government policy which leads to a separate conclusion in favour of disclosure in which the public interest factors are again described as “finely balanced”. In his response to the appeal, the ICO states that “there is no determination” in the decision notice in respect of the Attorney General exemption because he asked DHSSPS what part of Section 35 was relied upon and was told “Section 35(1)(a)”. 13. It will be seen that the effect of this piecemeal operation is that at no stage when carrying out the balancing exercise did the ICO consider “all the circumstances of the case” as required by Section 2(2)(b) FOIA. 4Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 14. This point was not taken in any of the written submissions. Mr Hopkins submitted that if this became an issue time should be granted for further written argument. As it happens, our reasoning in this case does not require us to rule on this point; had it done so, then we agree that fairness would have required us to give time for further submissions. 15. We would add only this. The ICO accepts that disclosure under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) requires a single balancing exercise. It would seem to follow that, on the ICO’s interpretation, there will be a large number of cases in which public authorities, the ICO and the Tribunal will be required to make a sometimes difficult decision about which disclosure regime applies in order to find out how to conduct the public interest balancing exercise. C. The LPP Exemption 16. We readily accept that there is a public interest in favour of disclosure of the disputed information. Some of it can be described in the usual way by referring to the value of accountability, transparency and public understanding for the reasoning behind official decisions. It is better, however, to put some flesh on the bones. The decision to opt out of the relaxation of the ban was important and controversial. We would not ourselves attach much weight to the effect of disclosure on the total amount of blood available; but we would stress the importance of Mr McDermott’s legitimate public interest in ensuring that those whom the Rainbow Project represents are able to participate in society as the ordinary citizens that they are. It follows that it is proper for him to be concerned that any restriction in the matter of something like blood donation is properly supported by expert opinion. 17. The ICO refers also to the failure to consult the executive committee; the disparity with England, Scotland and Wales; and questions of EU law. We regard these as all part of the controversial nature of the decision. 18. That said, it is important not to overestimate the role which disclosure of the disputed information might play in public debate. The Attorney General’s advice was sought after the decision was taken. It can therefore give no guide as to the 5Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 Minister’s motives or reasoning. Moreover, much more important to the public debate is material already publicly available in the expert reports; the scientific information on which they are based and the Hansard account of the Assembly Committee’s investigation. 19. Another factor to be taken into account in assessing the public interest in disclosure is that when the request was made judicial review proceedings, in which the Attorney General represented DHSSPS, were already underway. It could reasonably be expected that before long, the Attorney General’s mature consideration of the legal issues would be aired publicly in open court. 20. Having considered all the circumstances including the closed material it seems to us that the public interest in maintaining legal professional privilege outweighs the public interest in disclosing the Attorney General’s advice. 21. The significant weight which must be attached to the public interest in preserving LPP is sufficient, in our judgement, to be decisive of this case. This factor has a general importance. See the cases summarised in DCLG v The Information Commissioner and WR (2012) UKUT 103 (AAC) especially at paragraphs 36-46. 22. We should perhaps make two further comments on our reasons for disagreeing with the ICO decision. Unlike the ICO we do not consider the public interest attaching in general to LPP to be weakened by his view that the judicial review proceedings would not be “undermined”, whatever that might mean. Their existence at the time of the request seems to us to be an additional specific factor in favour of maintaining the exemption. It seems unfair that a public authority engaged in litigation should have a unilateral duty to disclose its legal advice. 23. It is not necessary to issue a closed decision to deal with the confidential annex. Suffice it to say that, with the exception of its final paragraph, the matters raised in the confidential annex have been included in our assessment. As to the final paragraph, Mr Hopkins accepted at the hearing that its conclusion was overoptimistic. 6Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0081 Appellant: DHSSPS Date of decision: 13 November 2013 24. Our conclusion in respect of the LLP exemption, in which we have taken into account all the factors in favour of disclosure, is sufficient to allow the appeal. Had we gone on to consider the exemption under Section 35(1)(c), either separately or cumulatively, it seems inevitable that we would have found in favour of DHSSPS on this issue also, especially having regard to the weight which must be attached to the Law Officers’ Convention. See the judgement of Blake J in HM Treasury v Information Commissioner and Owen (2009) EWHC 1811(Admin). It did not seem to us that section 36(1)(a) added materially to the decision. 25. Our decision is to set aside the ICO decision notice and, for the reasons we have given, to confirm that DHSSPS correctly refused the information request. The information requested is exempt from disclosure. NJ Warren Chamber President Dated 13 November 2013 7"
"74","Substantive Refusal","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 Appeal Numbers: EA/2013/0107 & 0108 B E T W E E N:- Appellant: DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION Respondent: INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Determined on the papers on 10th October 2013. Decision: 17 October 2013. Before Judge Brian Kennedy QC Steve Shaw Alison Lowton Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000, and the engagement specifically of Regulation 2 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL: The tribunal dismisses these appeals. REASONS Introduction: 1. This decision relates to appeals against two Decision Notices (“the DN’s”) issued by the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) on the 23rd April 2013 (numbered FS50479368 and FS50480392). The DN’s, effectively identical, concern two requests from the same Provider for closely related information wherein the Respondent reached the same 1decision in conclusion giving the same reasons. The parties agree that the matters are identical and can be dealt with together. The appeals have been brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”), specifically in relation to the application of Regulation 2 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs). 2. The Tribunal panel sat on the 10th October 2013 and decided the case on the papers. Request by complainant: 3. The complainant wrote to the Department for Education (“the DfE”) on 23rd August 2012, requesting the following information: “I request a copy of the Independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel minutes of discussions relating to Wands worth Council’s application for consent under Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (as amended) to dispose of school playing fields at Elliott School in Putney.” And “I request all correspondence between the Chair of the Independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel and Secretary of State for Education relating to the application by Wandsworth Council under Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (as amended) for consent to dispose of school playing fields at Elliott School, Putney. I request in particular the official letter from the Chair of the Independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel outlining to the Secretary of State for Education the panel’s grounds for advising against consent being granted by the Secretary of State to Wandsworth for disposal of Elliott School playing fields.” 4. The DfE held two documents containing information within the scope of the request, both dating from July 2012 and refused the information requests, 2relying on the exemptions under section 36(2)(b)(i) and (ii) and section 36(2)(c) of FOIA. The DfE upheld those refusals on internal review. 5. The Requester complained to the Commissioner who in the course of his investigation asked the DfE to explain why it considered that FOIA rather than the EIR’s applied in these cases. The Commissioner was not satisfied with the reasons given and issued the DN’s, the subject matter of these appeals. The 36 exemptions are therefore not the subject matter of these appeals but the Commissioner maintains that if FOIA is the applicable regime then the DfE’s refusals of the requests were correct in any event. The Commissioner’s Decisions: 6. The Commissioner had been supplied with a copy of the withheld information. It relates to the disposal of school playing fields at Elliott School in Putney. The DfE explained to the Commissioner that the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel (“the Panel”) considers such disposal applications against criteria set out in published guidance (see paragraph 12 below) and there is no reference to future use of the land in those criteria. The DfE also explained to the Commissioner that the Panel’s recommendation is one of the factors the Secretary of State (“the SoS”) takes into account and he can come to a different conclusion when reaching a decision on whether to give consent to the disposal of the land. The DfE confirmed its view that both the Panel and SoS are only concerned with the educational impact of disposal of the playing field land rather than any subsequent use of the land, concluding that the withheld information is of an educational nature rather than environmental. 7. In the Commissioner’s decisions he considers that, irrespective of the fact that the intended future use of the land did not form part of the decision making process as to whether or not to sanction its disposal, the fact that it is being disposed of is a measure under Regulation 2(1)(c) EIR, likely to affect the elements of the environment because of the potential change to 3the use of the land. In the DNs he sets out Regulation 2 (1) (a) to (f) in its entirety. 8. Regulation 2(1)(c) of the EIR defines environmental information as being any: “measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) above as well as measures to protect those elements;”. 9. Regulation 5 of the EIR places a public authority that holds environmental information under a duty to make that information available under request, unless an exception applies. The Commissioner therefore in his DNs found that the DfE did not deal with the request for information in accordance with the EIR as it did not apply the correct legislation when handling the request. Grounds of appeal: 10. The appellant appeals the Commissioner’s decisions on the following grounds: a) The Commissioner focused on the wrong measure b) The Commissioner applied the wrong standard of likelihood and c) The requested information is too remote from the state of the landscape or from measures likely to affect the landscape. 11. The DfE argues that the only measure in any way capable of having an effect on the landscape in this case was the SOS’s decision, not the Panel’s recommendation, arguing that the requests were not for information “on” the SOS’s decision. The Commissioner would accept that, on the facts of this particular case, “the measure” for the purposes of Regulation 2(1)(c) which would affect or would be likely to affect the factors in (a) and (b), is the SoS’s decision on the consent for the disposal of the playing fields. However the Commissioner maintains that the withheld information is “on” 4the SoS’s decision and therefore falls with in the definition in regulation 2(1)(c) EIR. The Commissioner maintains that in order to be consistent with the purpose stated in the first recital of Council Directive 2003/4EC (“the Directive”) from which the EIR are derived, “any information ---on” in Regulation 2 EIR should be interpreted widely. Citing Recital 2 of the Directive states: “Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of views, more effective participation by the public in environmental decision-making and eventually, to a better environment”. The Commissioner argues, inter-alia, that “any information --- on” will usually include information concerning, about or relating to the measure, activity, factor etc. in question. In other words information that would inform the public about the matter under consideration and would therefore facilitate effective participation by the public in environmental decision making is likely to be environmental information. 12. The Tribunal agree with the Commissioners’ interpretation and we accept that it is in deed open to wide interpretation. We find that the Panel’s recommendation on the playing fields was an integral part of the information which had to be before the SoS and which he was obliged to consider in making his decision. We refer to the Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for Academies July 2007 guidance (“the Guidance”) on Management & Finance at Tab 6 of our Bundle and in particular Part IV thereof at paragraphs 39 to 100. Under Criterion 3: Finance: therein from paragraph 79 on, is set out process and considerations, including the sale of the land, which could affect school playing fields which the SoS must consider. On the particular facts of this case we are satisfied that Wandsworth Council’s application included information indicating an intention for the playing fields of the school to be redeveloped for housing. We accept the contention that if consent was given, it is more likely than not that the Council would pursue its plans to redevelop and the measure would be likely to affect the land or landscape. The panel would have had access to this information in their deliberations. 5Accordingly we find on the facts of this case, even though the withheld information may not have a direct effect on the elements of the environment or to record or discuss such an effect, it is “on” a measure within S2(1)(c). 13. The Tribunal has considered the Guidance carefully and find that in following the Guidance, and on the facts of this case, the Panel must consider, even indirectly, factors concerning the Landscape itself when considering the Councils application for disposal, including factors such as (but not exclusively) disposal of funds from sale, the quality of the playing fields and alternative playing field uses. 14. We accept the Commissioners’ argument that the requested information does inform the public about the matter under consideration and therefore facilitates effective participation by the public in environmental decision making and are therefore likely to be environmental information on a measure affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in Regulation 2(1)of the EIR. 15. In light of the above reasoning we also find that the Panel’s deliberations and recommendations to the SoS are not too remote and dismiss the appeals for the above reasons. 16. The DfE seek guidance through this appeal and we take cognisance of this by discussing the matter further. The tribunal notes that on the facts of this particular case, and in accordance with the Guidance, the Panel’s recommendation was that the Council’s application to dispose of the playing fields be refused. In this instance, the SoS did not follow the Panel’s recommendation and further the SoS’s decision was not based on the proposed use of the land. It seems that the Commissioner’s DN’s are based on the SoS’s decision to dispose of the playing fields. In other words, whether or not the information is covered by EIR’s depends on the outcome of the decision making. The Tribunal is mindful that the relevant word in the regulations is “affect” and not “change”. It is arguable that any 6decision about land or landscape may “affect” the land or landscape regardless of the actual decision. If this is correct, the Tribunal is of the view that even had the SoS’s decision been in support of the Panel’s recommendation or he for any other reason had refused the sale of the land, the potential for disposal of the Land means the withheld information should be dealt with under the EIR’s. This is of course obiter but is our considered view in light of what we see as the wide interpretation that should be given to Regulation 2 of the EIR’s. Conclusion: 17. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal unanimously refuses these appeals. 18. The respondent has the right to apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application must be made to the Tribunal in writing within 28 days of this decision. Brian Kennedy QC Tribunal Chairman DATE: 17th October 2013. 7"

REASONS FOR DECISION Summary 1. We have decided that the Information Commissioner was wrong to conclude that the information request in question was not vexatious. We have also decided that any information covered by that information request would have been subject to the exemption provided by section 21 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), (a ground not relied upon during the Information Commissioner’s investigation) with the result that the Leicester City Council (“the Council”) would have been entitled to refuse disclosure on that basis also. The Request for Information 2. On 22 October 2011 Mr Seddon wrote to the Council drawing attention to an announcement in a local paper of a musical event due to take place at the East Park Road Working Men’s Club in Evington. He asked if the club had registered the event with the Council ten working days prior to the event taking place. The letter went on to ask, also, if the Leicester Railwaymen’s Club was in receipt of a “Premises License (sic)”. We will refer to this letter as the “Information Request”.The legislative context of the Information Request 3. The significance of this two-part request lies in the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003 (“LA 2003”) as they apply to clubs. The Act creates separate regimes for the authorisation of certain events taking place on the premises of a club, depending on whether it is one in which the members own all the assets jointly (a “Membership Club”) or one in which the assets are owned by a separate individual or organisation (a “Proprietary Club”). The categories of events requiring authorisation are the sale or supply of alcohol and the provision of certain types of entertainment or late night refreshments. They are described as “Licensable Activities”. Both categories of club may carry out other activities without authorisation or restriction. 4. If any Licensable Activity is to be carried out it is generally necessary for a licence to be obtained (a “Premises Licence”). That applies to all types of premises, including those owned or operated by a Proprietary Club. However a bona fide Members Club may supply alcohol to a member, or the guest of a member, and may provide certain types of entertainment (“Regulated Entertainment”) without a licence, provided that it has obtained a “Club Premises Certificate”, which covers the activity in question. 5. If a Members Club wishes to carry out an activity that falls outside the scope of its Club Premises Certificate (typically one involving the sale of alcohol to members of the public who are not members or guests of a member) it has a choice. It may either surrender its Club Premises Certificate and apply for a Premises Licence, or it may rely on a system for giving a Temporary Event Notice (a “TEN”) in respect of each planned event. A TEN must be lodged with the local licensingauthority, with a copy provided to the local police, at least ten days in advance of the proposed event. If no objection is raised the club may proceed with the event, but if no notice is lodged, or if objection is raised, the event will not be authorised and an offence will be committed if it is proceeded with. A club may only avail itself of the TEN procedure on twelve occasions. It follows that if events falling outside the scope of the blanket authorisation provided by the Club Premises Certificate are likely to occur regularly a club will be forced to seek a Premises Licence covering the activity in question. 6. LA 2003 section 8 requires licensing authorities to keep a register (the “Licensing Register”) containing details of, among other things, each Club Premises Certificate and Premises Licence issued by it and each TEN received by it. The section then provides: “(3) Each licensing authority must provide facilities for making the information contained in the entries in its register available for inspection (in a legible form) by any person during office hours and without payment. (4) If requested to do so by any person, a licensing authority must supply him with a copy of the information contained in any entry in its register in legible form. (5) A licensing authority may charge such reasonable fee as it may determine in respect of any copy supplied under subsection (4).” 7. It may be seen, therefore, that the first part of the Information Request was, in effect, a request for information from the Licensing Register about any TEN filed by the club in question. The second part was for information about the Club Premises Certificate granted to the second named club.The historical context of the Information Request 8. The Information Request had been preceded by a great deal of correspondence between Mr Seddon and the Council on the subject of the administration of clubs operating within its area, extending back to 2008. Mr Seddon had expressed the view, as early as March 2008, that the majority of clubs were being operated in breach of LA 2003 and indicated that he intended to draw these, at that stage unspecified, failings to the attention of the newspaper industry if those responsible for club regulation did not investigate them. 9. The Council provided Mr Seddon with a considerable amount of information about the impact of LA 2003 on both Proprietary Clubs and Members Clubs, including the categories of activities that a club could conduct without authorisation and those “licensable” activities for which authorisation was required by one or other of the means described above. 10. Although Mr Seddon initially appeared to be grateful for the Council’s time and effort in providing him with this information he appears to have concluded at some stage that the Council was not carrying out its duties with sufficient rigour. He made no challenge to the Council’s interpretation of the provisions of LA 2003 but began regularly to send it information about imminent events that he believed required a TEN and to criticise it for, in his view, failing either to prevent the event happening (because of the absence of proper notice, in his view) or to ensure that it was organised in a way that complied with the law (e.g. to ensure that no alcohol was supplied during the event to a member ofthe public who was not either a club member or the guest of a member). 11. The frequency of correspondence increased over time and the issues raised overlapped one another. We have therefore set out in the annex to this decision a summary of all the correspondence during the 12 months prior to the Information Request. It will be seen from this that Mr Seddon concentrated his attack on eight clubs, but that he focused his attention, in particular on the Leicester Railwaymen’s Club (section 6 of the Annex). In respect of that club: a. Mr Seddon wrote 13 letters between June and October 2011 in respect of amateur boxing events. Even though his first letter produced a response from the Council confirming that the Club Premises Certificate authorised boxing and wrestling (so that a TEN was not required) he continued to draw attention to advertised events and to assert that a TEN should have been lodged in respect of each one, culminating in an allegation that the Council Officer with whom he was corresponding could herself be charged with being in violation of the LA 2003. b. Mr Seddon asserted that a TEN should have been lodged in respect of a launch event for a new dance academy, the event being described as a “showcase of dance classes”. He then wrote 19 letters between February and July 2011 repeatedly asserting, in increasingly strident tones, that the TEN procedures should have been followed despite the Council’s clear explanation of why it believed that the event was covered by the Club Premises Certificate and its suggestion that there was no evidence that any activities had taken place that fell outside the categories of events authorised under it.12. In respect of other clubs Mr Seddon asked questions in respect of, and complained about the Council’s perceived failure to regulate, events such as: a. A surgery conducted by local councillors (New Parks Working Men’s Club – Annex section 3.2 – 6 letters), culminating in one letter asserting that the surgery was “unlawful” and that the Council was guilty of condoning it; b. A community awards ceremony (Saffron Lane Working Men’s Club – Annex section 4.2) including the suggestion that the Council’s failure to insist on a TEN amounted to “a generous gift” to the club; c. A meeting convened by a local Member of Parliament to discuss the viability of social clubs (Saffron Lane Working Men’s Club – Annex section 4.4) The refusal of the Information Request 13. The Information Request was interpreted by the Council as a request for information under the FOIA. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in the FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 14. The Council refused the request. At that stage it did not rely on any exemption. It relied, instead, on FOIA section 14, which entitles apublic authority to refuse a request for information if it is vexatious. There is no statutory definition of “vexatious” for this purpose. 15. Although the refusal was communicated to Mr Seddon by means of a letter dated 28 October 2011 this did little more than to remind Mr Seddon that it had told him previously, by a letter dated 15 July 2011 (referred to in the Annex and hereafter in this part of our decision, as the “First FOIA Refusal Letter”), that it had come to the conclusion that his recent requests to its Licensing Team had been vexatious and that its refusal of those requests applied equally to the Information Request. 16. The First FOIA Refusal Letter had cited the number of requests the Council said that it had received from Mr Seddon (it said that there had been 57 separate requests since January 2011, although Mr Seddon subsequently denied that they should all be treated as FOIA requests). The Council also said that the requests had been received with considerable frequency, sometimes simultaneously, and that they had placed a disproportionate burden on its staff. It said, also, that some of the correspondence received from Mr Seddon had adopted a hostile tone. 17. Mr Seddon complained to the Information Commissioner about the Council’s refusal and, following an investigation, the Information Commissioner issued a Decision Notice on 1 August 2012 in which he decided that the Council had not been entitled to rely on FOIA section 14 and directed it to respond to the Information Request by either disclosing the information requested or issuing a valid refusal notice setting out any exemption on which it wished to rely.18. In reaching his conclusion the Information Commissioner said that he had taken account of the complete context and history of the Information Request, including the 150 letters that he said Mr Seddon had written to the Council since February 2008. Following his own guidance as to the factors that may indicate that a request is vexatious the Information Commissioner concluded that: a. The requests and other correspondence had not imposed a significant burden on the Council, and had not diverted staff resources, because all the information requested would have been readily available to the relevant members of staff. b. There was a serious purpose to Mr Seddon’s investigations of the Council’s administration of club licensing matters, despite the Council’s own scepticism as to whether he had the research interest he claimed and the fact that a portion of his enquiries had focused on the same issue (the absence of a TEN) in respect of successive events at a small number of clubs. c. There was no evidence that Mr Seddon’s information requests were motivated merely by a desire to cause a nuisance. d. Although some remarks in Mr Seddon’s correspondence were derogatory of the Council or its staff this did not amount to harassing members of staff and, contrary to the Council’s contention, there was no evidence of racially offensive remarks. e. Mr Seddon was not guilty of being unwilling to accept any point of view that differed from his own and of wishing to take the Council over the same ground even after he had exhausted the Council’s attempts to help him. The Information Commissioner was not convinced, therefore, that Mr Seddon’s behaviour had been obsessive or manifestly unreasonable, as the Council had contended.19. When considering whether Mr Seddon had harassed the Council the Information Commissioner added that he had seen, within the correspondence: “…evidence that [Mr Seddon] was deeply dissatisfied with being directed to obtain information from a ‘computer website’. He made clear that he wished to received (sic) licensing register information in hard copy form, something the council resolutely refused to provide.” Elsewhere in his Decision Notice the Information Commissioner made clear that it was not within his jurisdiction to assess whether the Council had complied with LA 2003 section 8 by making the Licensing Register available to the public only in electronic, and not paper, form. At the same time he expressed the view that Mr Seddon was not comfortable with computers and suggested that it was not unreasonable for him to have required the information he requested to be provided in paper form. The appeal to this Tribunal 20. On 30 August 2012 the Council submitted a Notice of Appeal to this Tribunal. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 21. The Notice of Appeal was accompanied by detailed Grounds of Appeal in which the Council asserted that the Information Commissioner’sdecision had been perverse or otherwise wrong in law. It argued, in the alternative, that if and insofar as the requested information was held by the Council, it was exempt under FOIA section 21(1) (information reasonably accessible by other means). Although that provision had been mentioned in correspondence between the Council and the Information Commissioner it had not been relied upon previously. However, it is now established law that a public authority may introduce a new ground for resisting disclosure even after a Decision Notice has been issued. 22. In support of its primary case under FOIA section 14 the Council drew attention to the large quantity of correspondence received from Mr Seddon which, it said, was all concerned with the same issue of the authorisation of club premises and club events and on many occasions did not constitute a genuine attempt to obtain information, but was made for the purpose of making the point (which the council asserted was an ill founded one) that authorisation should have been sought for the event in question. The Council also relied on the frequency of letters from Mr Seddon and the sarcastic, dismissive and/or aggressive manner in which he expressed himself on occasions. It sought to cast doubt on whether Mr Seddon really was undertaking a study of the administration of clubs, as he claimed from time to time in his correspondence, and argued that Council staff felt harassed and found themselves diverted from their normal licensing functions. The Council drew attention, in particular, to the fact that requests continued unabated even after the Council had sent Mr Seddon its First FOIA Refusal Letter on 15 July 2011. 23. The Grounds of Appeal included comment on the passage from the Decision Notice quoted in paragraph 19 above and argued that the Council had been justified in not maintaining the Licensing Register inpaper form and that it should not be required to adopt a paper records system purely for the benefit of Mr Seddon. 24. In his Response to the Grounds of Appeal the Information Commissioner joined issue on whether the facts supported a finding that the Information Request had been vexatious but then expressed the view that: “…the dispute in the present case actually arises from a genuine disagreement as to where the threshold lies between an individual requiring a legitimate level of assistance and accommodation due to factors of infirmity and limited technical expertise, and that individual’s request in this case being deemed vexatious.” He went on to argue that the Council had disregarded the evident lack of technical expertise enjoyed by Mr Seddon and had focused solely on the existence of its own on-line resources. 25. Although, therefore, the Information Commissioner defended his conclusion under section 14, he was willing to concede, both that the Council was entitled to raise an argument under FOIA section 21 at this late stage and that the exemption was engaged because his own researches had established that the information held on the Licensing Register also formed part of the Council’s publication scheme. In those circumstances the Information Commissioner invited the Tribunal to issue a substituted decision notice concluding that the Information Request had been lawfully refused on this basis, although not on the basis of FOIA section 14. 26. Although it might be appropriate, in these circumstances, for the Tribunal to decide the section 21 issue first and, if it found it to havebeen engaged, not proceed to consider section 14 at all, we have in fact determined both issues. 27. Directions were given on 22 October 2012 for the appeal to be determined on the papers, without a hearing, and that Mr Seddon should be joined as a Respondent. In the event Mr Seddon wrote to the Tribunal to say that he did not wish to participate in the appeal beyond submitting some short written submissions. These were to the effect that he only wrote to the Council with questions about events at Institute Union clubs which had been held out as what he described as “public events” in the Leicester Mercury newspaper. He also drew the Tribunal’s attention to some difficulties he had experienced since the date when the Information Request had been refused, in trying to access, online, the Council’s Licensing Register. He argued that the Council was not complying with LA 2003 section 8 because it only provided the register required by that section online and not in paper form. Our conclusions on FOIA section 14 28. Before stating our conclusions there are two issues that were covered in the submissions presented to us, but which we believe are not relevant. 29. First, we believe that all parties have placed undue emphasis on the question of whether the Licensing Register was maintained in electronic or paper form and, indeed, on the significance of that section to the facts of this case. The plain fact is that the Information Request did not constitute a request for a copy of the register entries for a particular club. In fact only one or two of the previous requests could fairly be characterised as such a request. It may be that, had theInformation Request asked for a copy of the register in respect of The East Park Road Working Men’s Club, or even that part of its register entry dealing with TENs, then the proper construction of section 8 might have come into play. Even then it would not be for the Information Commissioner to determine that issue, as he has stated, and nor would it be for us to determine whether the language of the section precluded the adoption of a paperless format. It might nevertheless be relevant to the issue we do have to determine because, it might be argued, it is difficult to characterise as vexatious a request for something which, under another statute, a public authority is required to provide. However, the Information Request was expressed in different terms. It did not ask for access to the Licensing Register, or a copy of a particular club’s entry, it asked whether a TEN had been lodged in respect of a particular event at one club and whether another club had a “Premises License (sic)”. 30. We conclude, therefore, that we may approach the question of whether or not the Information Request was vexatious without concerning ourselves with any possible interplay between the FOIA and the LA, let alone any question as to the correct interpretation of section 8 of the latter statute. 31. The second issue which we believe we may ignore is the question of whether Mr Seddon’s unfamiliarity with computers should have any impact on our determination even though, again, the point has been pressed on us by the parties. The Council reached the point where it concluded that the context and history of communications from Mr Seddon justified treating his requests on the same subject as vexatious when it wrote the First FOIA Refusal Letter on 15 July 2011. No issue had arisen at that stage as to whether Mr Seddon was entitled to insist on responses in paper form, for the simple reason that every previousresponse had adopted that form in any event. The Council reiterated its view when, ignoring the First FOIA Refusal Letter, Mr Seddon submitted further requests, including the Information Request. The Council made it clear in its letter of 28 October 2011 that it was relying on the same grounds of refusal as it had set out previously. Then, in an apparent attempt to be helpful, it drew Mr Seddon’s attention to the existence of information accessible electronically. It was only after Mr Seddon had subsequently attempted to avail himself of that resource that a debate arose in the correspondence as to the ease of access and the general acceptability of a paperless format. It is not therefore the case, as the Information Commissioner indicated in his Decision Notice (and elaborated upon in his Response), that the imposition of an electronic format played any part in the history of relations between the Council and Mr Seddon up to the date when the Information Request was refused on the ground that it was vexatious. 32. Having disregarded those two issues, we have reached the conclusion that the history of communications from Mr Seddon justified the Council in deciding, by 15 July 2011, that his enquiries on the subject of club events being authorised by a Club Premises Certificate, a Premises Licence or a TEN had become vexatious and that it was justified in maintaining that view when it subsequently received the Information Request. 33. Although the Information Commissioner’s guidance is not binding on us, (and other Tribunal panels have warned of the dangers of using the guidance for a “tick box” exercise), we have included in our considerations each of the factors taken into account by the Information Commissioner, as summarised in paragraph 18 above. We deal with each in turn.34. Significant burden: The quantity and nature of the correspondence summarised in the Annex demonstrates, to our satisfaction, that the Council’s staff members dealing with it bore a not insignificant burden of work which was likely to have distracted them from other duties, including the regulation and control of the other categories of club which the Council regarded as giving rise to public risk (see Annex 4.3.8 in which the Council identified these as “premises that are acting in a way that causes problems in relation to crime and disorder, public nuisance, public safety, or the protection of children from harm”) rather than the social clubs with which Mr Seddon was concerned. 35. Serious purpose: Mr Seddon adopted a view of the law, contrary to that adopted by the Council and explained to him in correspondence, which he then pursued by lodging a series of requests about individual events, such as those in paragraph 11 above. He made no attempt to debate with the Council why he thought that the interpretation it had adopted as to its duties was incorrect, but simply pursued his own view that each event he identified lacked proper authorisation and that the Council was failing in its duty by not intervening. He continued in this way even when the Council had clarified the point in respect of a particular event (see Annex section 6.5.22 - 6.5.36) and he adopted, throughout, a sarcastic and argumentative tone both in his requests and in the many subsequent letters of complaint he wrote about the way they had been handled or the Council’s failure, in his view, to investigate how the particular event had been conducted (Annex section 5.1.6. and 6.5.14.). This is not a criticism of Mr Seddon’s misunderstanding of the authorisation process (although the Council’s explanation of it during the early stages of the correspondence was relatively clear) but on his obdurate pursuit of his own belief as to its effect, which became in our view obsessive. This attitude also served to undermine any argument to the effect that Mr Seddon was pursuinga serious purpose. The issue of club administration may be a serious one, in general terms, but the pursuit of a particular interpretation of one element of it, with no apparent willingness to countenance any alternative view but one’s own, has the effect of trivialising it. We therefore reach the conclusion that, whether or not Mr Seddon had a genuine academic interest in social club regulation, his pursuit of it by repetitious information requests (and associated correspondence) focused on one aspect of it did not serve any serious purpose. 36. Motivation to cause a nuisance: Two of us felt that Mr Seddon did set out to cause a nuisance by his information requests, but the third member of the panel preferred to give him the benefit of the doubt, particularly as we had not had an opportunity of assessing his motivation in a face to face meeting. 37. Derogatory tone: We also felt that, contrary to the Information Commissioner’s conclusion, Mr Seddon had adopted a sarcastic and unpleasant tone throughout the correspondence, but particularly when the Council expressed any view that did not accord with his own (Annex section 4.3.10 and 4.3.14; 5.1.10; 6.3.7, 6.3.8, 6.3.18 , 6.3.20). This included one instance in which Council staff was accused of being in the pay of club owners (Annex section 6.5.38). Mr Seddon frequently resorted to unpleasantness, in the circumstances we have described, with no attempt to address the area of disagreement with logical argument. We can well understand that the Council’s staff may have felt harassed by the tone of the correspondence, as well as the regularity of its submission, and believe that we saw evidence of this in the contemporary annotations made to some of the letters on the Council’s file (Annex section 5.1.10) and in some of the language of Mr Seddon’s letters, which appeared to threaten to continue the barrage ofcommunications until the Council adopted an approach which he considered more appropriate (Annex section 10.1.4). 38. We believe that the correspondence, summarised in the Annex and mentioned in paragraph 35 above, demonstrates occasions when Mr Seddon demonstrated an unwillingness to accept another point of view, particularly on the central issue as to whether a Members Club needed to utilise the TEN procedure in respect of an activity already covered by its Club Premises Certificate. 39. In light of the above, but in particular the lack of serious purpose achievable by the approach adopted by Mr Seddon to his information requests and associated correspondence, we have concluded that the Information Commissioner was wrong to conclude that the Council had not been entitled to refuse the Information Request under FOIA section 14. Our conclusion on FOIA section 21 40. Section 21, which is an absolute exemption, provides that “Information which is reasonably accessible to the applicant otherwise than under section 1 is exempt information.” 41. In its Grounds of Appeal the Council simply argued that, if and insofar as it held any information falling within the scope of the Information Request, that information would have been reasonably accessible to Mr Seddon via the online register maintained under LA 2003 section 8.42. In his Response the Information Commissioner drew attention to the fact that the Licensing Register, in addition to being information which the Council was obliged to make available under section 8, was also included in its FOIA publication scheme. It was on this basis that, as previously explained, the Information Commissioner was prepared to accept that the section 21 exemption was engaged. 43. It seems to us that this is clearly correct and we therefore conclude that the Council would have been entitled to refuse the Information Request under this provision as well as in reliance on FOIA section 14. Conclusion 44. It follows that the appeal should be allowed. 45. Except where otherwise indicated, our decision is unanimous.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. In 1988 Rowntree Mackintosh (“Rowntree”), a large UK confectionary group, was acquired by Nestle, a Swiss company, for £2.55 billion. There was much public controversy surrounding the acquisition at the time centring around UK merger laws because of the lack of reciprocity under Swiss law which appeared to limit freedom to acquire companies based in the home country of the buyer. Rowntree was a long established company with its roots in York with a special reputation for the ethical way it treated its employees and undertook its business. There was concern that these values might be dissipated by a takeover and that the workforce would be adversely affected. 2. Lord Young of Graffham was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry at the time. Under the competition laws in place (Fair Trading Act 1973) he had responsibility for deciding whether to approve the acquisition or refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He decided not to make a reference and approved the acquisition. -2-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 3. Since 1988 there has been a reduction in confectionary manufacturing in York with many well known brands such as Smarties being transferred to be manufactured overseas. Also there have been hundreds of redundancies and the “Rowntree” sign at the company’s York premises has been replaced with a “Nestle” sign. The request for information 4. More than 20 years later, in November 2008, Mr Aitchison made a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) for all information held by the Cabinet Office dating between 1 April and 1 August 1988 relating to the takeover of Rowntree. Specifically, he asked for: “ Copies of any and all documentation held by the Cabinet Office, dated between 1 April 1988 and 1 August 1988, relating to the takeover of Rowntree chocolatiers. This should include, but not be limited to, minutes of meetings; copies of letters sent/received by the then Prime Minister or other ministers; copies of any memos or speeches which were either drafted or issued; and copies of any decisions made.” 5. In its response, the Cabinet Office provided some information, but withheld other information on the basis of sections 35(1)(a) (formulation or development of government policy) and 35(1)(b) (Ministerial communications) of FOIA. It made no mention of the “neither confirm nor deny” (“NCND”) provision at section 35(3) of FOIA. 6. Two more years passed. On 13 September 2010, the Tribunal handed down its decision in Cabinet Office v IC (EA/2010/ 0031), [2011] 1 Info LR 838 (“Westland decision”). It ordered disclosure of the minutes of the meeting of the Cabinet on 9 January 1986, in which Michael Heseltine resigned due to his disagreement with colleagues over whether the government should intervene in the investment by an American company in the British helicopter manufacturer Westland plc. Unlike in the case of Cabinet Office v IC and Lamb (EA/2008/0024 and EA/2008/0029), [2011] 1 Info LR 782 - concerning the minutes of the Cabinet meeting at which the decision to commence war against Iraq was discussed – the government did not exercise its veto over that order. The minutes of the ‘Westland’ Cabinet meeting were duly made public. 7. In light of this decision, Mr Aitchison resubmitted his request on 14 October 2010. On 28 October 2010, the Cabinet Office refused to provide any further information on two main grounds. 8. First, it withheld five documents on the grounds of sections 35(1)(a) and (b), as before. As to the public interest in disclosure, the Cabinet Office set out some considerations of a general nature in its refusal of Mr Aitchison’s -3-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS request. As to the public interest in maintaining the exemptions, the Cabinet Office’s case was as follows: “ These public interests have to be weighed against a strong public interest that policy-making and its implementation are of the highest quality and informed by a full consideration of all the options. Ministers and their advisers must be able to discuss policy freely and frankly, exchange views on available options and understand their possible implications. The candour of all involved could be affected by their assessment of whether the content of the discussions will be disclosed prematurely. If discussions were routinely made public there is a risk that Ministers may feel inhibited from being frank and candid with one another and in seeking the advice of officials or other experts. As a result the quality of debate underlying collective decision making would decline, leading to worse informed and poorer decision making.” 9. The second limb of the Cabinet Office’s refusal was put as follows: “I can neither confirm nor deny that the Cabinet discussed the takeover of Rowntree in 1988”. The writer sought to distinguish the Westland decision and concluded, “The Cabinet Office agrees with this [the Tribunal’s observations that records of Cabinet discussions will rarely be disclosed] and remains of the view that there is a strong public interest in protecting collective responsibility as set out above”. 10. By letter of 18 November 2010, the Cabinet Office upheld this refusal on internal review, although it made no mention of its NCND position. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 11. Mr Aitchison complained to the Commissioner about the Cabinet Office’s refusal of his request. The Commissioner investigated. He had some difficulty in obtaining prompt and helpful input from the Cabinet Office. He had at one stage to threaten to issue an information notice. 12. On 3 October 2011, the Commissioner issued a decision notice in which he found that the two exemptions claimed were engaged but that the public interest balance favoured disclosure of the information and ordered disclosure of the five withheld documents. He also ordered the Cabinet Office to confirm or deny whether it held any information about Cabinet discussions of the Rowntree takeover. -4-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS The appeal to the Tribunal 13. On 7 November 2011 the Cabinet Office appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the Commissioner’s findings. Mr Aitchison was joined as a party. 14. The case was heard mainly in open session but partly in closed session in order to facilitate evidence and submissions on the detail of the disputed information. 15. Mr Aitchison gave evidence as well as oral submissions. He is news editor for The Press newspaper in York (formerly the Yorkshire Evening Press). In 2008 he was the paper’s political editor. Jeremy Pocklington gave evidence on behalf of the Cabinet Office both in open and closed sessions. He was Director in, and Deputy Head of, the Economic and Domestic Affairs Secretariat in the Cabinet Office when he provided his written witness statement. Since May 2012 he has been Director of Enterprise and Growth in the Treasury. The law 16. As mentioned above, all five disputed documents are withheld on the basis of section 35(1)(a) FOIA, which provides that: (1) Information held by a government department ….. is exempt information if it relates to— (a) the formulation or development of government policy. 17. The Cabinet Office also contends that four of the five documents (numbered ii-v in the confidential annex to the DN) fell within section 35(1)(b) FOIA, which provides that: (1) Information held by a government department ….. is exempt information if it relates to— ... (b) Ministerial communications... 18. As regards discussions of the Rowntree’s takeover – if any – by the Cabinet, the Cabinet Office bases its “neither confirm nor deny” (“NCND”) position on section 35(3) FOIA, which provides as follows: (3) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1). 19. All of these exemptions are class based exemptions which, when engaged, are subject to a public interest test under section 2. For section 35(3) the -5-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS test as to whether the duty to confirm or deny arises is contained in section 2(1)(b) “ In all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information.” 20. In respect of sections 35(1)(a) and (b) the test is found in section 2(2)(b) “ In all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 21. A number of tribunal cases were relied on by the parties. We should say that we are not bound by any other First-tier Tribunal decisions or those of the former Information Tribunal – see London Borough of Camden v The Information Commissioner &YV [2012] UKUT 190 (AAC) §12. In that case the Upper Tribunal found that: “previous decisions are of persuasive authority and the tribunal is right to value consistency in decision-making. However, there are dangers in paying too close a regard to previous decisions. It can elevate issues of fact into issues of law or principle”. 22. The parties brought the following findings to our attention some of which have been helpful in guiding our analysis of the facts in this case. We have not regarded them as issues of law or principle. 23. Department for Education & Skills v IC (EA/2006/0006), [2011] 1 Info LR 689 involved a request for copies of all minutes of senior management meetings regarding the setting of school budgets in England. The Tribunal ordered disclosure. It held that: 1. Notwithstanding the absence of a prejudice requirement for the engagement of s. 35(1)(a), the inclusion of information within such a class exemption does not of itself indicate that there will be any damage to the public interest if that information is disclosed. Where s. 35(1)(a) is engaged, the public interest balancing test begins with both pans empty. Disclosure follows if that remains the position (see in particular paragraphs 62-65). 2. As to the public interest in maintaining s. 35(1)(a), the central question in every case is the content of the particular information in question. No information is exempt from disclosure simply on account of its status or classification, nor on account of the seniority of those whose actions are recorded. 3. It is appropriate to consider the protection from compromise or unjust public opprobrium of civil servants, but not ministers. 4. As regards the process of policy formulation, the fundamental principle is that during the process of formulation, disclosure of information on -6-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS discussion of policy options is highly unlikely to be in the public interest (unless, for example, it would expose wrongdoing within government). When the formulation of a particular policy is complete is a question of fact. A parliamentary statement announcing the policy will normally mark the end of the process of formulation. 24. Department for Work & Pensions v IC (EA/2006/0040) [2011] 1 Info LR 716 involved a request for a copy of the feasibility study undertaken to establish the impact of the proposed identity card scheme. The Tribunal ordered disclosure of information falling within s. 35(1)(a). It held that: 1. Timing is crucial in an analysis of the formulation and development of government policy. S. 35 FOIA does not automatically deem or assume that disclosure of the information will be harmful. Rather, the particular circumstances of the case must be assessed. 2. As to the public interest, it is relevant to consider what specific harm would follow from the disclosure of the particular information in question. The focus should be on the public interest factors specifically associated with that particular exemption, rather than on a more general consideration of the public interest in withholding the information. 3. In this case, the disputed information was of low importance in terms of the harm that might flow from its disclosure, and relevant in assisting the public in understanding government thinking. 25. Cabinet Office v IC and Lamb (EA/2008/0024 and EA/2008/0029), [2011] 1 Info LR 782 concerned the minutes of the Cabinet meeting at which the UK’s entry into war against Iraq was deliberated. Although this involved ministerial communications, the Tribunal again ordered disclosure. The underlying issues and public interests were somewhat different to the present case, but the Commissioner says the following points are relevant: 1. The passage of time is a relevant factor. Its effect will differ from case to case. 2. The Tribunal’s task is not to decide the public interest in general terms about certain types of information. Rather, it must decide the balance of the public interest on the particular facts before it. 3. The convention of collective Cabinet responsibility clearly affords very considerable benefits in terms of good decision making at the highest level of government, but it had adapted and would continue to adapt. 4. Those arguing for disclosure have a “slight advantage”, in that they do not have to show that the factors in favour of disclosure exceed those in favour of maintaining the exemption. They only have to show that they are equal. -7-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 26. As referred to above, Cabinet Office v IC (EA/2010/ 0031), [2011] 1 Info LR 838 also involved minutes of a Cabinet meeting, this time concerning Westland plc. The Tribunal ordered the disclosure of those minutes. Unlike the present case, that case involved publicly aired disagreement between ministers, revelations in published memoirs and conflicting accounts of events. The Commissioner says those, however, were only among the factors supporting the Tribunal’s conclusions – there is no suggestion that they were decisive of themselves. The following more general points, the Commissioner says, offer relevant guidance concerning the disclosure of Cabinet minutes and by extension other less sensitive ministerial communications: a) The convention of collective responsibility means that Cabinet minutes always contain information of great sensitivity which will usually outlive the particular administration, often by many years. The general interest in maintaining the exemption is therefore always substantial and disclosure within 30 years will very rarely be ordered, and then only in circumstances where it involves no apparent threat to the cohesive working of Cabinet government, whether at the time or in the future. b) Such circumstances may include the passage of time, and where those involved have left the public stage. c) The fact that the issue discussed in Cabinet has no continuing significance may weaken the exemption, but the importance of the convention of collective responsibility is not dependent on the nature of the issue which gave rise to debate. d) There is always a significant public interest in reading the impartial record of what was transacted in Cabinet. The public interest in disclosure is strengthened where the Cabinet meeting had a particular political or historical significance. e) In the circumstances, although there was a case for maintaining collective responsibility, 19 years had passed by the time of the request. Only one member of the Cabinet (Ken Clarke) remained in frontline politics. f) No member of the Cabinet could justifiably feel traduced by the publication of the minutes of 9 January 1986 in 2005. No member of the present or any future Cabinet would be deterred from putting forward arguments by reason of the thought that the opinions expressed would be made public 20 years later. 27. More recently, the Tribunal in Department of Health v IC, Healey and Cecil [2012] 1 Info LR 489 considered the application of s. 35(1)(a) to two risk registers documenting the risks associated with implementing NHS reforms under what was then the Health and Social Care Bill. It ordered the -8-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS disclosure of one of those registers. The Commissioner brought our attention to the following points. 28. First, the Tribunal’s analyse of the issue of the times at which a “safe space” is required [at paragraph 28]. 29. Secondly, at paragraph 67, the Tribunal noted that independent research carried out by the Constitution Unit at University College London has concluded that there is little evidence of FOIA leading to a chilling effect. 30. Thirdly, the Tribunal cautioned against public authorities adopting a de facto absolute approach to a qualified exemption. At paragraph 73, the Tribunal said this: “ We would observe that the DOH’s position expressed in evidence is tantamount to saying that there should be an absolute exemption for risk registers at the stages the registers were requested in this case. Parliament has not so provided. S.35 (and s.36) are qualified exemptions subject to a public interest test, which means that there is no absolute guarantee that information will not be disclosed, however strong the public interest in maintaining the exemption.” 31. Mr Cornwell for the Cabinet Office also referred us to All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition v IC EA/2011/0286 at paras. 142 -146 and Home Office and Ministry of Justice v IC [2009} EWHC 1611 (Admin) at paras. 34-35. 32. Under section 62 a record becomes an “historical record” at the end of the period of thirty years beginning with the year following that in which it was created. 33. In April 2010 the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act was enacted. Section 45 provided for the “thirty year rule” for historical records to be transferred to the National Archive to be reduced to 20 years but only once implemented through further legislation. In May 2010 there was a change of government. On 7 January 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Coalition Government would be introducing the change. The “twenty year rule” will be implemented through secondary legislation making amendments to the Public Records Act and providing for transitional provisions. It would appear from the evidence before us that these transitional provisions, whereby two years’ records will be released each year to transition from the existing 30 year rule to the new 20 year rule gradually over a period of 10 years, were to enable the twenty year rule to be introduced in “a manageable and affordable way” and was not to do with the contents or type of information. Also section 62 FOIA will be amended correspondingly gradually to reduce the period after which a record becomes an “historical record” including for records comprising information covered by the exemptions relevant to this case. -9-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 34. According to Mr Pocklington, the implementation of these transitional provisions is likely to mean that the disputed information in this case will become publically available in 2015. The questions for the Tribunal 35. Firstly we need to consider whether the claimed exemptions are engaged. The Commissioner and Cabinet Office both agree that section 35(1)(a) is engaged for all 5 documents and that section 35(1)(b) is also engaged for 4 of those documents. Mr Aitchison is unable to comment because he has not seen the information. We have reviewed the disputed information and agree that these exemptions are engaged. As they are class based exemptions we only need to consider the public interest test under section 2(1)(b) and whether the Commissioner was correct that the public interest balance favoured disclosure. 36. As far as the NCND claim for Cabinet discussions (if any) we need to decide whether the Commissioner’s decision that the public interest balance favoured the Cabinet Office being ordered to confirm or deny whether it held information about Cabinet discussions of the Rowntree takeover was correct. Public interest test - background 37. As there is agreement on the engagement of exemptions the only matter we need to consider is the public interest test. In order to do this we need to identify the factors for and against disclosure and the weight we should give to them. Then we need to make a decision on where the public interest balance lies, bearing in mind that where it is evenly balanced then the disputed information should be disclosed. 38. Firstly, we need to set out the background from the evidence before us. 39. We were provided with evidence that Rowntree was regarded as a great British firm, dating back to the 19th century and operating under that name since approximately 1862. It was important, in economic and employment terms, to the City of York in particular and for years had been planning strategically and successfully to achieve a world presence. At the time, concerns were expressed about the impact of the takeover on employment at Rowntree; subsequent reports state that many jobs were lost following the takeover. We were not provided with any direct evidence these were lost through the takeover. However we were informed that a number of confectionary lines had been moved from York to overseas and therefore conclude that these moves are likely to have resulted in redundancies. - 10 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 40. Careful building of a European business ahead of 1992 had established Rowntree’s brand as an important and growing power in European confectionary. For a non EEC company without an EEC foothold this was an important strategic acquisition. However, while Nestle (the acquirer) appeared to benefit from protection against foreign purchasers under domestic law in Switzerland, Rowntree benefited from no such protection in the UK. Concerns were expressed as to this disparity and its effects on fair competition. Reports suggest that the governments of France, Belgium and West Germany were sufficiently concerned to investigate the potential competitive effects of this takeover. 41. There were calls from the Rowntree board, local councillors and from Opposition and Government MPs for the acquisition to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in order to block the takeover. 42. In May 1988, the chairman of Rowntree lobbied the then Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, to intervene by referring the takeover bid to the Monopolies & Mergers Commission (the predecessor to the Competition Commission). Mrs Thatcher responded that the government’s policy on this issue had been set out in a speech by Lord Young of Graffham, the Trade and Industry Secretary, in a speech on 12 May 1988. The position appeared to be that the government was not minded to intervene and that regulatory oversight of the takeover bid would proceed in the usual way. 43. This position was within the law at the time. Decisions on whether to allow mergers and takeovers to proceed were taken by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to sections 63 to 75 of the Fair Trading Act 1973. In this case, the Secretary of State at the relevant time was Lord Young. Lord Young had the power, under the legislation, to either clear a takeover or to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - in effect a quasi-judicial role. His decision was based on a report by the then Director General of Fair Trading, which would have considered the effects on competition and other relevant public interest arguments. 44. However, in a speech given at around May 1988, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe appeared concerned that such takeover bids were not taking place on a level playing field. 45. An article in the Financial Times on 12 May 1988 suggested that Mr Howe’s intervention reflected confusion in government policy on this matter. In her letter to the Rowntree chairman, Mrs Thatcher made no reference to Mr Howe’s speech or its bearing on government policy. 46. A further contemporaneous article in the Independent written by Jeremy Warner (now assistant editor of The Daily Telegraph) referred to an alleged political motivation for the government’s reluctance to intervene to protect Rowntree from this foreign takeover bid. - 11 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 47. From this evidence we conclude that the decision was controversial at the time and of high public interest at both a national and regional level. 48. We were informed by Mr Pocklington in evidence that the regulatory regime governing takeovers has since changed, such that Ministers now have a much more limited role in decision-making. These changes were implemented by the Enterprise Act 2002 which removed the final decision making process from Ministers and transferred it to an independent competition authority (except in certain limited categories of case, not relevant here). Under the current regime the Office for Fair Trading decides whether to clear a merger, clear it subject to conditions or refer it to the Competition Commission for a second stage investigation. 49. Mr Pocklington informed us that there had been some changes to the 2002 Act in 2008 but he was not aware that the policy underlying merger clearance was actively under consideration at the time of the request. In any case it was subject to European competition law. Public interest factors favouring maintaining the exemptions 50. In relation to the engaged “Ministerial Communications” exemption under section 35(1)(b) the main public interest argued by the Cabinet Office relates to the convention on Collective Responsibility. 51. Mr Pocklington explained to us in detail what this entailed and why it was so important. This was also one of the factors the tribunal had to consider in the Westland case. In that case the tribunal helpfully set out at §§ 33 – 38 what this convention is: 33 The starting point for this decision is consideration of the doctrine or convention of collective responsibility, its purpose, its content and the interests which it is intended to protect. 34 It is a principle underlying cabinet government which has been recognised for at least one hundred and fifty years. Bagehot acknowledged its significance. Its importance grew as the Monarch`s control of and influence over his or her ministers weakened and they closed ranks against royal attempts to weaken them by promoting divisions. It gained recognition as a fundamental requirement of effective and cohesive government. A useful recent account of its development and significance is to be found in House of Commons Library Research paper 4/82, published on 15th. November, 2004.Its requirements are set out today in the Ministerial Code, which has been published with modifications since 1992. Paragraph 2.1 provides: - 12 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS “ The principle of collective responsibility, save where it is explicitly set aside, requires that ministers should be able to express their views frankly in the expectation that they can argue freely in private while maintaining a united front when decisions have been reached. This in turn requires that the privacy of opinions expressed in Cabinet and Ministerial Committees, including in correspondence, should be maintained.” 35 For present purposes, it has two related aspects: <U+F0B7> The requirement that all ministers of every rank publicly support collective decisions of the Cabinet and Cabinet committees, suppressing any private dissent, whether or not they were party to such decisions (“the primary aspect”). <U+F0B7> The principle that the content of discussions, including the expression of divergent opinions, leading to such decisions will remain confidential. That imposes a duty of silence on ministers and others with access to the content of such discussions, notably special advisers and civil servants (“the secondary duty”)1. It is this latter aspect of the convention which is affected by s.1 of FOIA. 36 The object of the primary aspect of the convention is the preservation of a united front in Parliament and in the country without which effective government will not long survive. The requirement has been suspended by Prime Ministers on a very few occasions in relation to a specific issue – most recently by Harold Wilson at the time of the 1975 Referendum on membership of the EEC ( as it then was ). However, such a dispensation merely underlines the enduring importance of the convention. Clare Short remained briefly in the Cabinet after public criticism of the government`s policy on Iraq but this was an isolated exception to the operation of the rule. 37 The secondary duty (confidentiality) is treated by the Code as a protection for the minister who must loyally support a policy against which he had argued in Cabinet. He should not be exposed to unjust contrasts in the media between the views he once expressed and those he now professes to support. If that were its sole justification, it could be argued that it lapsed at the end of the administration when the immediate demands for an appearance of unity were over and he or she would be free to explain his or her position. However, Mr. Fellgett2 asserted, there 1 The terms primary and secondary are used simply as shorthand, not as indicating a view that the one is subordinate to the other. 2 The Director and Deputy Head of the Economic and Domestic Affairs Secretariat. - 13 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS are further considerations. Disclosure of the opinions once expressed among themselves by former ministers, especially in Cabinet, is likely to inhibit candour in similar exchanges among their current and future successors, as mentioned above. Moreover – and this is perhaps another formulation of the same point – the duty of confidentiality is owed, not simply to the individual colleague, the Prime Minister or even the administration as a whole but to the convention itself and the enduring strength and confidence that it provides to the working of Cabinet government. Any breach, by minister, adviser, civil servant or FOIA disclosure, weakens the principle. 38 It is important to remember that the exemption relied on, s.35(1)(b), covers not simply Cabinet Minutes but all “ministerial communications”, hence correspondence, memoranda and reports circulated to colleagues with relevant responsibilities and unminuted oral discussions – the product of “sofa government”. The point is that Cabinet minutes, given the subject matter of discussions recorded, are likely to raise the issue of collective responsibility in its most acute form. 52. Mr Pocklington in evidence adds: “ This does not mean that Ministers may not express different views internally. They must be able to express their views freely and frankly in order to enable the Government to take well-informed and carefully scrutinised decisions, whether those decisions are taken in Cabinet or Cabinet Committee or by individual Ministers. However, given that all Ministers will be expected to take responsibility for and defend the Government’s decisions, it is crucial that the opinions expressed in Cabinet and Ministerial Committees, in correspondence and in records of conversation between Ministers, are not disclosed except in exceptional circumstances. Were it to become routine it would alter the character of discussions and reduce their effectiveness in producing good policy. It follows that the internal process through which a decision has been made, or the Committee by which it was taken should not be disclosed.” 53. However he accepted the exemptions claimed in this case are qualified subject to a public interest test and there can be no absolute guarantee of non disclosure. However he considered there was a strong public interest in protecting the confidentiality of Ministerial discussions and communications in order to preserve the convention of Cabinet collective responsibility which he says applies in this case. He explained that such collective responsibility also applied to quasi-judicial responsibility to make certain decisions as was the position in this case. - 14 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 54. The Commissioner accepts there is significant public interest in the convention on Cabinet collective responsibility and its importance in government decision-making. Also he accepts that there is continuing political significance of the issue of takeovers of British companies by foreign rivals. 55. However, he argues that the disputed information was at least 22 years old at the time of the request and therefore the weight to be given to this public interest reduces. Some information retains its sensitivity over time, while other information gradually loses that sensitivity. He says the circumstances of this case place it in the latter category. 56. Mr Pocklington particularly considered that discussions between Ministerial colleagues if revealed in the “near future” would have a chilling effect on the way such discussions would take place in future. He says that if disclosures of such information became routine it would alter the character of discussions and reduce their effectiveness in producing good policy. The chilling effect would also apply to civil servants supporting such discussions. This is an argument which the tribunal often has to consider in regard to the need for a “safe space” for policy formulation and development. 57. The Commissioner was not persuaded that disclosure in this particular case would have any serious impact in terms of eroding the ‘safe space’ for policy formulation, or in terms of a ‘chilling effect’. In particular, disclosure would be very unlikely to: 1. deter present or future members of the government from considering policy options which some might deem unpalatable; 2. deter present or future members of the government from putting across their position robustly in relation to similar issues which might arise; 3. result in unreasonable attempts to intervene in governmental decision- making on such issues; or 4. pose a threat to the convention of Cabinet collective responsibility or the cohesive working of government. 58. Mr Pocklington admitted in cross-examination that the doctrine of collective responsibility had survived the “shock” of the Westland disclosures and other odd breaches of the convention but that did not justify future breaches. 59. Mr Pocklington points out that Lord Young, who was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry at the time, and therefore personally responsible for the decision on the Rowntree takeover, is a member of the House of Lords and in June 2010 was invited by the current Government to conduct a review of health and safety laws. This advisory project finished on 19 November 2010. He was later asked to act as an enterprise adviser but this was not until 2011. Mr Pocklington says that because Lord Young is still active in public life this is a relevant factor in weighing up the public interest in this - 15 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS case. It was not brought to our attention at the hearing that any other ministers in 1988 were still active in public life in 2010. However we are aware that Kenneth Clarke was in the Cabinet in 1986 and in the Coalition Government at the time of the request and remains so, although not in the Department for Trade and Industry or today’s equivalent. 60. Finally Mr Pocklington asserts in this case that the public interest is already served by other information in the public domain. The Commissioner’s position is that there is insufficient evidence to support that assertion. In any case recent newspaper articles show there is continuing public interest in the events that took place in 1988 which even in 2010 were still affecting people in York. Mr Pocklington urged us to focus on the Minister’s decision. The Commissioner says we should consider the evolution leading to the decision and any light particular information might shed on how Government and the Secretary of State arrived at their public decision. We consider that FOIA does not restrict us to what we might consider. Under FOIA we are required to consider “all the circumstances of the case”. 61. As to these public interests for maintaining the exemption Mr Aitchison says “ it is difficult to conceive of how disclosure of these Cabinet minutes could involve any apparent threat to the cohesive working of cabinet government, now or in the future. Those politicians involved in the Cabinet debate concerning the Rowntree takeover have to all intents and purposes left the public stage. The Rowntree takeover has no ramifications for the present government.” 62. The Cabinet Office also claimed that a factor for maintaining the exemption was the lack of “... evidence of urgent or wide public concern with the circumstances of the acquisition ...”, this lack being assessed solely by a media search undertaken at the time of the request. The Tribunal considers this approach to be misconceived. The Freedom of Information Act is based on an entitlement for an applicant to have disclosed to them information held by a public authority, subject to the exemptions provided in the Act. “Evidence of public concern” is not necessarily material to this entitlement. However we do have before us articles written by Mr Aitchison which seem to show a continuing concern of the people of York. Public interest factors for disclosure 63. The Commissioner argues that there are strong public interests in the disclosure of the requested information. Those interests relate to enhanced transparency, openness and public understanding of the government’s role in and views on (if any): - 16 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 1. an important issue in industrial policy under the Thatcher government, namely how (if at all) to respond to calls for intervention in takeover bids with potentially serious consequences for competitive markets, and where the would-be purchaser enjoys legal advantages over its rivals; 2. the transfer of a long-standing British company to foreign ownership; 3. an issue of great importance, including in economic and employment terms, to a major British city, and 4. there is further substantial public interest in understanding whether there is merit in the reported suggestions of differences of view between ministers and of political motivation. 64. Mr Aitchison puts the public interest in disclosure in this way “ York is famed internationally for its confectionary history. It was, for many years, home to two of Britain’s best-known chocolatiers, Terry’s and Rowntree (latterly Nestlé). And it is the birthplace of many famous products, including Smarties, KitKat, Aero and Fruit Pastilles. The confectionery industry constitutes a big part of York’s identity. More broadly, the Rowntree’s name holds a wider importance in York and the Rowntree family’s legacy is held in huge regard. The takeover of Rowntree by Nestlé in 1988 was a momentous moment in the city’s history and it deeply affected many thousands of people - economically and/or emotionally. Our newspaper at the time coordinated the “Hands off Rowntree” campaign, which drew considerable support. Around 13,000 readers signed petition vouchers, which were taken to Downing Street and around 1,000 people staged a demonstration in London. The takeover, and the opposition to it locally, generated news coverage around the world. I believe there can be little doubt that the takeover, and the Government’s actions surrounding it, are of public interest and that there is, therefore, an inherent public interest in the public being able to read the impartial record of what was transacted in Cabinet on this issue.” 65. Also he says “there is a public interest (and certainly an interest to the public of York) in reading the impartial record of what debate took place in Cabinet concerning the takeover of a very significant business interest in York, which had both historic and cultural implications.” Public interest balance 66. In order to consider the public interest balance we need to identify the time at which we should be considering the test. There has been a consistent line of tribunal decisions which has been largely approved by higher courts - 17 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS that recognise that the time we should be applying the test is at the time of the request or thereabouts but no later than the time of the internal review, which in this case was 18 November 2010 (“the time period”). 67. We have considered all the public interest factors referred to above, in the light of the time period, and have come to the following conclusions in order to apply these factors and the weight we should give to them in the balancing exercise we need to undertake in relation to the disputed information. 68. We consider that the convention in relation Cabinet collective responsibility is a very weighty public interest factor for maintaining the Ministerial Communications exemption (s.35(1)(b)). However at the time of the request the disputed information was 22 years old which in our view diminishes the weight to be given to this public interest in the circumstances of this case. The fact that the historical records provision will be changed only after the time period is something we cannot take into account. However we note that the policy decision to reduce the 30 year rule to 20 years was taken before the time period although not implemented. The new Coalition Government reconfirmed the policy in early 2011 and subsequently gave details of how they intended to implement the change but after the time we need to be considering the public interest test. Although we cannot take into account later factors we believe we can look at later events which shed light on the weight we might give to a factor existing at the time of the request. The fact that there are intended to be transitional provisions again sheds light on the factor existing at the time, and we note these seem to be for cost and operational reasons rather than relating to the type or content of the information. 69. At the time of the request the policy decision had been taken to reduce the 30 year rule. This did not change despite a new government. The government (in its various guises) had, in effect, decided that the public interest in keeping historical records secret for 30 years would reduce to 20 years. 70. We accept the Commissioner’s view of the chilling effect on future behaviour in the circumstances of the case and therefore do not give it as much weight as the Cabinet Office would wish us to give this factor. In this case, 22 years later, there would be no information “revealed publicly in the near future” 3 about Ministerial communications (including discussions in Cabinet if any) in 1988. Also we are mindful of the fact Lord Young was no longer in government in 2010. Although he acted as an adviser this was not in a policy area related to mergers and it appears to have been a one off project in 2010 which ended at the time of the internal review. 71. We accept that government must be given a protected safe space for policy formulation and development. However in the circumstances of this case we 3 Quote from Mr Pocklington’s witness statement at para 19. - 18 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS find that there is very little evidence that merger policy or the Ministerial Code were under active policy review during the time period. In any case merger policy is very different today to that in 1988. Therefore we find the need for a safe space was diminished and accordingly the weight we should attribute to this public interest factor. 72. The concern expressed by Mr Pocklington that Cabinet discussions and minutes if routinely disclosed would have a chilling effect and, in effect, make it difficult to maintain the convention on collective responsibility should be treated with a certain amount of circumspection. We would state, as have other tribunals faced with similar requests, that such information will be rarely disclosed because of the strong weight of the public interest in maintaining the exemptions. However we are required by law to consider the circumstances of each case and undertake a public interest test, so there will be occasions when the public interest balance favours disclosure. This does not mean, in Mr Pocklington’s words, that it will “become routine”. 73. In contrast the public interest in transparency and openness in this case seems to us to be very weighty indeed. This is not only for the reasons given by the Commissioner and Mr Aitchison, and the likely continuing consequences for employment in the confectionary industry in York. There is also a weighty public interest in knowing that when a Minister of the Crown is charged with exercising a quasi-judicial function (as was the case with the decision which fell to Lord Young to take about the takeover of Rowntree), the quasi-judicial role of the decision maker was not compromised by improper political or other pressure. Although the regime for taking decisions on takeovers has altered so as to remove Ministers from the process, there remain other areas in which controversial decisions have to be taken by Ministers on a quasi-judicial, rather than a political, basis. We discuss this aspect more fully in the confidential annex. 74. As a result we find that in the circumstances of this case, and also when aggregating the factors for and against disclosure, the public interest in maintaining the exemptions does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. We particularly find that there is very significant public interest (including for researchers of social, political and industrial history) in reading the impartial record of contemporaneous communications regarding a matter that had been of widespread concern both nationally and locally (and is still of concern today), whether these documents show the public authority acting entirely properly or whether there is any evidence otherwise. We do not find in the circumstances of this case that the public interest in Cabinet collective responsibility has the same weight. 75. We have provided a detailed analysis of the disputed information in the confidential annex to this decision which will only be made open (if at all) when any appeal process has been exhausted and the decision to disclose upheld. - 19 -IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL CASE NO. EA/2011/0263 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Conclusion and remedy 76. We find that the public interest balance favours disclosure. We therefore uphold the Commissioner’s decision notice and order that documents i - v of the disputed information are disclosed within 30 days of the date of this decision. We also order that the Cabinet Office confirms or denies whether it holds information about Cabinet discussions of the Rowntree takeover within the same timeframe. 77. Our decision is unanimous.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. We have decided that the Second Respondent was entitled to refuse part of a request for information that was concerned with the severance arrangements it entered into with a senior employee. This was on the basis that the information was the personal data of that individual and disclosure would have been contrary to the data protection principles. It was therefore exempt information under section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. We have also decided that the Second Respondent did not hold information falling within the scope of a second part of the request, about the procedures followed when dealing with a particular planning application, beyond that which had already been disclosed to the Appellant. Background 2. In recent years the Appellant Trago Mills (South Devon) Limited (“Trago Mills”) has from time to time found itself in disagreement with the Second Respondent (“the Council”) over planning issues affecting Trago Mills’ out-of- town shopping centre complex at Newton Abbot. Particular difficulty arose in relation to an application for a development that incorporated certain towers (“the Towers Application”). This was recommended for refusal by the Council’s Planning Officers, but was subsequently approved by its Development Control Committee. An individual who held the position of Service Lead for Planning at the time, (and who we will refer to simply as “X”), played the lead role in the initial recommendation for refusal. Trago Mills’ Chairman, Mr Robertson, told us that the disagreements arising from this and other planning matters related, not only to X, who he regarded as an “unmanaged maverick” , but also to others in the Council. He believed that there was a “cabal of officers who will not take criticism”. Mr Robertson told us that the relationship between his company and the Council made him frustrated and sometimes irritable. 3. In 2007 Trago Mills lodged a further planning application in respect of a shop and petrol filling station at the Newton Abbott premises (“the Filling Station 3EA/2012/0028; Decision Application”). The application was initially considered by a more junior colleague of X, who was minded to approve the application. However, X then became involved and took a different view, resulting in the submission of a modified scheme. Trago Mills was dissatisfied with this intervention. It had not appealed the refusal of permission but Mr Robertson complained to the Council about X’s conduct. His letter of complaint alleged that X had “displayed prejudice and a distinct bias against Trago from the very first time I met him…” This led the Council to commission an independent investigation by a firm of solicitors in order to see if X had displayed prejudice or bias. The solicitors subsequently submitted a report (“The Independent Solicitor’s Report”) in December 2009, in which they found that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. 4. When, in early 2010, Mr Robertson learned that X was to take early retirement as part of a Council scheme for reducing its staffing levels, he was suspicious. He thought that the manner of X’s departure was not as the Council would have it. He thought that the Council was well aware of what he described as X’s “misconduct” and that it had, in effect, dismissed him and was using the early retirement scheme, and the confidentiality claimed in respect of the severance agreement reached with X, as a “shield” to suppress the truth. At the time the Council had published a statement by its Chief Executive explaining that, as part of a scheme to secure £3.3M of savings over three years, six members of its senior management, including X, would be taking voluntary early retirement or voluntary redundancy. The bulletin added: “All of the departures are voluntary, are not subject to any ‘golden goodbye’ style arrangements, and will be taking place in March and April” 5. Mr Robertson’s suspicions, therefore, were that the Council’s Chief Executive had put her name to an untruthful public statement. He confirmed that this was his suspicion during cross examination in the hearing before us. 6. Mr Robertson also told us that he then instructed his solicitors, Stephens Scown, to request information about X from the Council under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) because he thought that this would be the best way of getting at the truth about X’s departure from the Council’s employment and of demonstrating that his allegations that X was an “incompetent officer”, who had been guilty of “wrongdoing” had been justified. He told us that he hoped that this would lead, ultimately, to an apology from the Council. The request for information 7. The information request that Stephens Scown lodged with the Council, on 15 February 2010, was in these terms: “We understand that arrangements are in place for [X] employment with the Council to end. Can you please confirm this and, if it is correct, please provide full details of the remuneration he will receive in connection with the termination of his employment. 4EA/2012/0028; Decision Please also provide us with a copy of his contract of employment and details of his remuneration package whilst in the Council’s employment.” 8. The request was made under section 1 of the FOIA, which imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply, or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. 9. Although the Council provided a redacted copy of X’s employment contract in response to the information request it refused to disclose other information about X’s employment on the ground that it was exempt information under FOIA section 40(2) (third party personal data). It did, however give Trago Mills an indication of the salary range applicable to X’s employment. 10. Some five months later Stephens Scown resurrected its client’s pursuit of information in a letter to the Council dated 2 August 2010. The relevant part read: “We understand that X’s employment with the Council has now been terminated. Please provide us with details of [X’s] severance package. From previous correspondence you will be aware that our client lodged a planning application for a petrol station which was considered by [X]. Please can you review and confirm the procedures followed by [X] in determining the application. Finally, please also provide us with the name of the solicitors undertaking the Independent Solicitor’s Report and the details of the Report itself” The planning application referred to was, of course, the Filling Station Application. 11. As to the first request (“the Severance Package Request”) the Council maintained its position that the information was exempt under FOIA section 40(2) and argued that the information would also fall within the exemption provided by FOIA section 41 (confidential information obtained from a third party). As to the second request (“the Planning Procedures Request”) it is evident that the Council initially treated the words “procedures followed by [X] in determining the application” as referring to any procedural guide which planning officers were expected to follow, rather than to the procedures that X actually followed. It therefore responded that it did not hold information falling within the request other than what was contained in the Independent Solicitor’s Report, which it also refused to disclose at that time. The Council’s decision on these issues was set out in a letter dated 2 September 2010, which also suggested that the parties could discuss the response to the information requests at a meeting that had already been arranged with Trago Mills for November of that year in order to discuss its complaints about the Council’s planning department. 12. The meeting, when it took place, was attended by Mr Robertson and the Chief Executive of the Council, among other people, and appears to have covered 5EA/2012/0028; Decision both the complaints about X’s performance of his duties and the disclosure of the requested information, in particular the Independent Solicitor’s Report. Mr Barnes, a Director of the Council, gave evidence, which was not challenged, about the meeting. He recalled, with the aid of a contemporaneous note, that those representing Trago Mills accused X of having allowed his personal opinions to interfere with his work and of having attacked its business by opposing the proposal for towers in the earlier planning application. They suggested that X had been “golden parachuted out of the organisation” and sought an apology from the Council and compensation arising from the refusal of the Filling Station Application. The earlier request for a copy of the Independent solicitor’s Report was also repeated and an indication was given that Trago Mills intended to bring legal proceedings against both X and the Council. 13. No more was heard until 20 April 2011 when Stephens Scown wrote to the Council again asking it, in effect, to carry out an internal review of the refusal communicated to it in its letter of 2 September 2010, seven months previously. The outcome of the review was set out in a letter from the Council dated 24 May 2011. At this stage the Council changed its mind on the Independent Solicitor’s Report and disclosed a copy. It therefore formed no part of this Appeal. Nevertheless Trago Mill’s counsel, Mr Lopez, spent considerable time during the hearing before us in cross examination and submission about the terms of reference for the report, the qualifications of the independent solicitor to adjudge the planning issues that were said to form a crucial element of it, and the Council’s delay in releasing it. 14. No such change of mind took place in respect of the other two elements of the information request. The Council continued to reject the Severance Package Request on the basis of FOIA section 40(2) and the Planning Procedures Request on the basis that it did not hold the requested information. However, in relation to that request, the Council provided a note of a conversation which had taken place after the November 2010 meeting. The note recorded that Mr Robertson had suggested that X had taken the file from the more junior officer once she had recommended approval and that this was improper conduct because X was prejudiced against any Trago Mills development. The note then read: “I have spoken to [redacted by Tribunal] about her recollection of how the matter was dealt with. Her recommendation was that the application should be approved but [a more senior colleague] thought it wise first to check with [X] to see that he was happy with the decision.” Having recorded that X thought that the application should be refused on certain policy grounds (which were subsequently realised to be inapplicable) and that a second application was submitted and approved, the note concluded: “At no stage did [redacted by Tribunal] feel that the file had been “taken off her” by [X], so far as she was concerned it was just part of the normal process of a senior officer reviewing a decision by the case officer something which is not at all unusual.” 6EA/2012/0028; Decision 15. The Council’s letter of 24 May 2011, which was signed by its Chief Executive, contained an assurance that X’s departure was wholly unrelated to the matters set out in the Independent Solicitor’s Report. The Complaint to the Information Commissioner and his Decision Notice 16. On 26 September 2011, some four months later, Trago Mills filed a complaint with the Information Commissioner. During the course of the investigation into that complaint the Council accepted that its initial interpretation of the Planning Procedures Request had been wrong and searched for, and released to Trago Mills, documents recording how the Filling Station Application had been dealt with. 17. At the conclusion of his investigation the Information Commissioner issued a Decision Notice on 9 January 2012. It covered a number of issues, but the ones that have relevance to this Appeal are the conclusions reached on the following issues: a. Whether the Planning Procedures Request fell to be determined under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”), rather than FOIA. However, as the obligation imposed on a public authority to disclose requested information is effectively the same under EIR regulation 5(1) as that imposed under FOIA section 1, (see paragraph 8 above), the ruling did not affect the rights and obligations of the parties involved. b. Whether the Council had failed to provide all the information falling within the scope of the Planning Procedures Request. The Information Commissioner considered the searches that the Council had carried out and the documents that had been released since the original request. He concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, no information was held beyond that which had already been disclosed. c. Whether information falling within the Severance Package Request fell within the exemption provided by FOIA section 40(2). He concluded that, although X held a senior role in the public sector, such that his reasonable expectations of privacy might be less than would otherwise be the case, they nevertheless outweighed the arguments for disclosure. The exemption therefore applied and the Council had been entitled to reject the information request. The appeal to this Tribunal 18. On 6 February 2012 Trago Mills filed an appeal with this Tribunal against the Decision Notice. Directions were given for joining the Council to the Appeal as Second Respondent and for a pre-hearing timetable. The Directions included a provision that the requested information should be provided to the Tribunal on terms of confidence. In the event the Council was granted permission to include in this closed bundle certain other documents that recorded the negotiations that led to X’s early retirement agreement and the advice that the Council received in respect of it, as well as a closed witness statement by Mr Barnes explaining the particular circumstances of X’s departure. 7EA/2012/0028; Decision 19. The Directions were complied with, save that in the last ten days before the hearing Trago Mills indicated that it wished to put in new evidence and sought to delay the filing of its skeleton argument until after this had been completed. Both the new evidence and the skeleton reached the members of the Tribunal on the morning of the hearing, although the other parties were able to access them a little earlier. After hearing an application by Trago Mills for permission to adduce the additional evidence we rejected it on the basis of relevance and delay. We expand on those reasons in paragraphs [60-62] below. The other parties did not press their objection to the late service of the skeleton and we therefore accepted it. 20. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. Frequently, as in this case, we find ourselves making our decision on the basis of evidence that is more extensive than that submitted to the Information Commissioner. Evidence 21. Both Trago Mills and the Council filed evidence in the form of witness statements. The witnesses were Mr Robertson for Trago Mills and Mr Davies and Mr Barnes for the Council. All the witnesses attended the hearing and were cross examined on their evidence. Mr Robertson 22. Trago Mills filed a witness statement by Mr Robertson. It dealt with the following three main issues: a. Mr Robertson’s expectation, based on previous experience, of what records would have been created and retained by the Council in respect of the Filling Station Application. This led him to express surprise at the Council’s suggestion that the only information held would be that stored, in electronic form, on a system called “Comino” and that no email traffic to and from X had been found. To some extent this was expert evidence without any explanation of the witness’s claim to expertise in the field, beyond his experience as a businessman who had from time to time instructed architects to file applications for his company. b. A history of the Towers Application involving towers on which he and X had disagreed some years previously. This section of the witness statement concluded with the following passage: “By reference to the above and other matters, which involved [X], I have made previously made (sic) to the Council what I believe amounts to a clear and categoric case of repeated planning officer wrongdoing by the Council” 8EA/2012/0028; Decision The “other matters” were not dealt with further in the witness statement. c. Mr Robertson went on to say that he assumed that the Council had instructed the preparation of the Independent Solicitors Report in response to his complaints about X. But he criticised the Council for having, in his view, characterised his complaint as one of bias, when it was more extensive, for having instructed a solicitor who did not have the necessary specialist skills to perform the task and for not having involved Mr Robertson himself in the process. 23. Mr Robertson was cross examined briefly on his witness statement. He was asked to explain the basis for his perception that the Council had covered up the real reason for X leaving its employment. In response he reiterated his suspicions, in the face of statements by the Council to the contrary, but did not provide any additional evidence to support the suspicions. He was also asked for his rationale, in public interest terms, for requesting details of X’s severance package. He acknowledged that he had a personal grievance, as a disappointed applicant for planning permission, but stressed the public interest in local authorities acting fairly and properly and stated that he believed that his request served the interests of the public. When pressed as to why the details of an individual’s severance package would serve that public interest he said that the information request had been formulated by lawyers, not a layman such as himself. He maintained the view that the request was justified. Mr Davies 24. Mr Davies manages the Development Management function of the Council’s planning service and said that he was, as a result, very familiar with how information about planning applications is held. He provided background about the history of the planning applications related to the Trago Mills business and exhibited newspaper articles dealing with the decision of the Council’s Development Control Committee in 2009 to approve the Towers Application. The “Newton Today” dated 8 May 2009, reporting on the opening of the new garden centre at Trago Mills, referred to Mr Robertson’s speech at the launch party. This included an expression of thanks to local councillors for their support in overcoming resistance from the Council’s planning officers and a statement that five new towers on the site had been given a name incorporating X’s first name and the word “spires”. The article said that this reflected the problems Mr Robertson had in convincing X that they were in keeping with the 27 others on the site. The Mid-Devon Advertiser recorded the same story including the statement that X had “tried to stop the new trademark Trago Towers going up only for members [of the Council] to pass them overwhelmingly. They are now referred to as ‘[X’s first name] Spires’” 25. With particular reference to the Filling Station Application Mr Davies effectively confirmed the summary set out at paragraph 14 above. He said: “This was initially considered by [case officer’s name redacted by Tribunal], whose initial view was to recommend that the Council grant the permission. However, when [name redacted by Tribunal] Head of Development Control, considered her recommendation he decided to 9EA/2012/0028; Decision seek the opinion of his Line Manger, [X], as he was concerned that the recommendation to approve the application was not in accordance with adopted Development Plan policies. It is perfectly normal practice for Officers to seek the advice of more senior Officers when preparing recommendations, or when considering the recommendations of other, to seek guidance or a second opinion on interpretation of policy. X decided, on a number of adopted and emerging planning policy grounds, that permission should not be granted.” He went on to relate that, although Trago Mills did not appeal the decision it made the complaint to the Council referred to above, leading to the preparation of the Independent Solicitor’s Report. 26. Mr Davies explained the approach adopted in respect of the Planning Procedures Request, including the release of information during the course of the Information Commissioner’s investigation. He then described how planning information is held by the Council. It is saved into an electronic document management system, called Comino, which has replaced the need for a paper file. Incoming and outgoing correspondence, documents, emails and notes may all be saved into the system in electronic form, although planning officers may create hard copy duplicates for their own convenience. He confirmed that a search had been made to see if X had left any relevant hard copy materials, but said that this had produced nothing. 27. According to Mr Davies’ evidence most documents created by planning officers would be automatically saved into the system on creation. However, in the case of emails, the officers would have to make a decision as to whether it warranted retention as part of the permanent file on the matter. If it did then a duplicate of what is automatically saved into the email system would have to be created and, with appropriate editing to protect personal data, saved into the Comino system. If permanent retention was not thought to be justified then the email will in due course be purged from the email system in order to free up space. 28. The file structure of, and the search facility incorporated in, the Comino system was explained by Mr Davies in some detail. The record of the Filling Station Application, which was disclosed to Trago Mills during the course of the Information Commissioner’s investigation, had been obtained by searching in the file created in Comino for that application. The adequacy of the search had been checked by reviewing the audit trail of all processes that took place in respect of the application and a separate audit trail incorporated into the Council’s document creation system. Relevant print outs in respect of the audit trail investigations were exhibited to the witness statement. 29. Mr Davies also considered any other locations where relevant material might be found. One was the Council’s computer hard drives. The folder where X saved his files had been searched using the search terms *03512* (the planning application number) and *rago* (a term that was thought to be wide enough to capture anything related to Trago Mills, omitting the first letter so as to avoid missing any case-sensitive records). A search in this part of the Council’s records would be effective across all planning applications, not just the file on the Filling Station Application, as in the case of the Comino system search. 10EA/2012/0028; Decision 30. Another possible location mentioned by Mr Davies was the Council’s email system, which was dealt with in the witness statement of his colleague, Mr Barnes (see below). 31. Consideration had also been given as to whether other departments might hold relevant information, but Mr Davies had concluded that anything generated in the course of consulting other departments would have been saved in Comino and not in the records of those departments. 32. Mr Davies explained that, in preparing for this appeal, and with a view to avoiding a hearing if further efforts produced anything to satisfy Trago Mills, the Council had extended its searches of its hard drive, as described in paragraph 29 above. It extended the search beyond anything to do with the Filling Station Application, regardless of whether X had been involved. This produced one further document, the draft decision notice prepared by the case officer who carried out the initial assessment of the application, before X reviewed it and took a different view. 33. The witness statement concluded by relating how X had been contacted in retirement to see if he could think of anywhere else the Council might search (he could not) and expressing Mr Davies’ personal view that there was “simply no other reasonable place the Council could have looked for this information”. He also said, in this context: “It appears to me that Trago Mills think there should be some documentary record of the internal discussions that took place between Officers between the time that the Case Officer made her initial recommendation and the time that the refusal notice was sent out. I can say from personal experience that this type of internal discussion is very rarely recorded. I have regularly been involved in similar discussions, under X’s management and more recently in my role as Service Manager, and I am not surprised that the Council had not found any information in this regard.” 34. During cross examination various suggestions were made to Mr Davies as to how other material might exist, in hard copy or electronic format, which had not been brought to light as a result of the various searches described in the Council’s evidence. It was even suggested (without any basis that we could see) that Mr Davies might have been “fearful” of hard copy documents coming to light. However, his answers were clear and wholly credible in explaining the thoroughness of the exercise the Council had undertaken. Other questions put to Mr Davies, about the apparent absence in 2007 of guidelines on how applications should be processed and the correctness of X’s approach in respect of the Towers and Filling Station Applications generated nothing that is relevant to the issues we have to decide, given our assessment of the content of the Closed Bundle. We found Mr Davies to be a convincing and helpful witness who gave straightforward answers to all the questions put to him. 11EA/2012/0028; Decision Mr Barnes 35. Mr Barnes is a Director at the Council responsible for five of the Council’s services, namely Legal and Democratic Services, Finance, Information and Communications Technology, Human Resources and Communications. Because of his responsibility for the Council’s IT issues he supported the evidence of Mr Davies on the Planning Procedures Request with some background about the Council’s retention of emails. He believed that X tended to discuss issues in person rather than by email and explained the process by which planning officers were expected to save any emails that were relevant to an application into the Comino system, so as to form part of the permanent record of the application. There was no obligation on X to save emails by any other means and officers were encouraged to delete emails, which did not merit being stored in Comino, once they were no longer needed. Mr Barnes also explained the Council’s general practice for permanently excluding from back-ups of its system any items selected by individuals for deletion and for deleting an email account once an employee left and his or her colleagues no longer needed to access it. 36. The back-up tapes had not previously been searched for emails relevant to the Planning Process Request, but Mr Barnes explained that, in an attempt to avoid an appeal hearing, it had carried out certain searches on historic back- up tapes. It did this despite a doubt as to whether such information was truly “held” by the Council and in the realisation that, if it was, the cost of searching would exceed by some margin the ‘appropriate limit’ on such costs set under s.12 of the Freedom of Information Act. Mr Barnes recorded that the Council’s experts rebuilt a copy of the system as it was then to enable them to search for data no longer held. It searched for emails or other documents against a number of search terms related to the planning application in question and X’s surname. This revealed over 300 files all of which Mr Barnes stated he had read. He confirmed that none of them contained information which was relevant to the information request and had not already been revealed. 37. The greater part of Mr Barnes’s witness statement concerned the Severance Package Request. He summarised the complaints made by Trago Mills about X, the requests for information lodged by Stephens Scown on its behalf and the manner in which the Council had dealt with them. This included the meeting in November 2010, which has been summarised at paragraph 12above. Mr Barnes explained that, following that meeting he made further enquiries about the outcome of the Filling Station Application and set out his findings in the note that was subsequently passed to Stephens Scown in May 2011 (see paragraph 14 above). 38. Mr Barnes stated that he had been involved in some of the negotiations that preceded X’s departure and he confirmed, in the plainest terms, that X’s departure had nothing to do with Trago Mills’ complaint or any other complaint. He then described the procedure that was followed in the early retirement/voluntary redundancy scheme that the Council introduced in 2009 and the confidentiality controls that were imposed in relation to it. In the case of X Mr Barnes explained that he was one of those who applied for early retirement/redundancy and that, following consideration of it and discussions 12EA/2012/0028; Decision with X, a compromise agreement was signed bringing the employment to an end with effect from 30 April 2010. Mr Barnes said no more about the details of the Council’s internal deliberations and discussions with X because, like the contents of the compromise agreement itself, it was regarded as confidential by X and included a specific obligation of confidentiality. He did disclose this much however: “Following discussions between the Council and [X], it was agreed that a compromise agreement was appropriate. This had nothing whatsoever to do with Trago Mills’ complaint about [X], nor about any complaint by anyone else. It had nothing to do with any dissatisfaction with [X’s] performance or conduct. I worked with him for many years and I know that there were no issues about performance or conduct. A compromise agreement was concluded simply because there was some uncertainty over exactly how the early retirement/redundancy scheme applied in [X’s] circumstances. The Council took specialist legal advice and as a result of this I considered that it would be prudent to protect the Council’s position by the conclusion of a compromise agreement which would ensure that we were not at risk from any subsequent claims for redundancy. “In my experience, this is a very common way for employment relationships to end. It did not involve paying [X] inappropriate sums, and it did not involve anything remotely unusual or untoward. I can say no more in open about this, but have explained further details in my closed statement, supported by contemporaneous evidence. My hope is that, having inspected the closed material in light of my closed statement, the Tribunal will agree with me that there was nothing untoward or unusual about this compromise agreement – and I hope that Trago Mills will take some comfort from the fact that an independent Tribunal is able to scrutinise the disputed information and the other closed material.” We will return to both of those passages in due course. 39. Mr Barnes disclosed that, in preparing for this Appeal the Council had sought X’s views and had been told that he expected the terms of his severance arrangement to be kept secret and that he would be distressed if it were not. The Council itself had concluded that there was nothing in the circumstances of the case to outweigh X’s right to privacy, despite his seniority, and that complying with the Severance Package Request would have been unfair and in breach of X’s rights in respect of his personal data. 40. Mr Barnes also filed the closed witness statement mentioned above. It provided us with further details of the Council’s internal deliberations and discussions with X and was entirely consistent with the summary in the passages from the open statement quoted in paragraph 38 above. 41. At the hearing before us Mr Barnes was subjected to sustained cross examination on his witness statement. This focussed, in particular, on the passage quoted in paragraph 38 above in which Mr Barnes explained that, on the basis of working with X for a number of years “there were no issues about performance or conduct.” Mr Lopez put to him that this was an untruthful 13EA/2012/0028; Decision statement. Later, in his closing submissions, Mr Lopez made clear the purpose of this line of questioning. The manner and content of the answers he extracted meant, he said, that we should not believe Mr Barnes when he told us, elsewhere in the same paragraph of his witness statement, that conduct issues had nothing to do with X’s departure. Quite why it should be thought that Mr Barnes would have chosen to lie on the point, when he would know that the Tribunal members had before them the Closed Bundle, which included the severance agreement and documents relating to the negotiations of its terms, is unclear. Nevertheless, Mr Lopez persisted in lengthy cross examination seeking to establish that X’s record disclosed mistakes, improper conduct and a complaint to his professional body, which were so serious that Mr Barnes must have known of them and should have drawn them to our attention. More importantly, it was suggested, he could not possibly have believed, in the face of that knowledge, that there were “no issues about performance and conduct”. 42. Mr Barnes remained steady under fire. He thought that the allegations of wrongdoing behind Mr Lopez’s questions arose from a misreading of the material relied on. He reiterated that, at the time when the severance agreement was negotiated, there were no complaints against X which had either been sustained or were justified in his view. He said that occasional technical mistakes or disagreements with applicants on planning issues did not justify the criticism that Mr Lopez voiced on his client’s behalf. He accordingly maintained that the judgment that lay behind the passage of his evidence under attack had been justified. 43. In his closing submissions Mr Lopez accused Mr Barnes of being an unreliable witness. We did not find him so. In our view he was a truthful witness who gave his evidence in a fair and measured manner with the intention of assisting the Tribunal even if his answers might be unhelpful to his employer’s case. He was criticised for being slow in his responses. We did not see that as a sign of unreliability. It seemed to us that he was punctilious in making sure that, before he gave an answer, there was nothing in his memory that might inform or qualify his evidence on the point. We regard Mr Lopez’s criticism of Mr Barnes as being wholly unjustified. 44. Nor was it necessary or relevant. Even if the passage on which Mr Lopez based his credibility attack had been inaccurate, it would have had no effect on our decision because, as we have said, we listened to Mr Barnes’ evidence in the knowledge that the contemporaneous material in the Closed Bundle was totally consistent with the crucial statement in his witness statement, to the effect that conduct questions had not come into the negotiations of X’s departure or severance package. 45. Mr Barnes was also subjected to sustained cross examination on the qualifications of the author of the Independent Solicitor’s Report to make the judgments he did (although Trago Mills offered no evidence on what his qualifications in fact were). The questioning developed into something of a debate on the task of any adjudicator who has to absorb detail on an area of expertise outside his or her own field. It did not generate any information that assisted us with our decision, for reasons that will become apparent. The Independent Solicitor’s Report was, of course, released to Trago Mills as a 14EA/2012/0028; Decision result of the internal review the Council was asked to undertake, so that the further questioning which then took place as to the reasons for the delay was irrelevant to any issue we have to consider. 46. Mr Lopez probed in cross examination for what lay behind a reference in Mr Barnes’ witness statement to unspecified “personal reasons” said to have influenced X’s wish for privacy as to the reasons for his departure. Mr Barnes tried hard to give as full an answer as he could, without breaching confidence. It is, of course, frustrating for the party seeking information to have to trust the Tribunal to form its views on the basis of closed material that is not made available to that party. However, we are satisfied, from our examination of the Closed Bundle that this part of Mr Barnes’ evidence was as full as it could be and provided an accurate summary of the issues that led X to seek early retirement and for the Council to agree to it on the terms of the severance package that was negotiated. 47. Finally, Mr Barnes was asked about a section of his witness statement in which he said that X’s reluctance to consent to disclosure was influenced by an apparent fear that the information might be “used in the media for damaging and malicious purposes”. Mr Barnes could not recall whether he or X had raised this possibility when he, Mr Barnes, had phoned to ask if X would be willing to consent to disclosure in order to avoid an appeal hearing. However, he accepted that they were both probably aware that there was a possibility of publicity being generated given that a photograph of X was known to have been exhibited at Trago Mills’ premises in the past and there had been public statements made about disagreement between Mr Robertson and X, as mentioned in paragraph 24 above. Mr Barnes was asked if he was suggesting that Mr Robertson was malicious. He replied that he did not think he was, but that he was of “combative stock” and was “not a fan of public servants”, whom he sometimes pilloried. He added that he could himself live with that sort of criticism but he suspected that it affected other people differently. 48. Against the background of that evidence we turn now to consider the issues we have to determine. The Planning Procedures Request – did the Council hold more information than it has disclosed? 49. We have mentioned, in paragraph 8 above the broad obligation for public authorities to disclose requested information. On the question of whether requested information is held by a public authority all parties referred us to the Tribunal decision in Bromley v Information Commissioner and Environment Agency (EA/2006/0072). The Council and Information Commissioner relied on a passage of the decision which, while not binding us, does set out a test in terms with which we agree. It reads: “There can seldom be absolute certainty that information relevant to a request does not remain undiscovered somewhere with a public authority’s records. This is particularly the case with a large national organisation like the Environment Agency, whose records are inevitably spread across a number of departments in different 15EA/2012/0028; Decision locations. The Environment Agency properly conceded that it could not be certain that it holds no more information. However, it argued (and was supported in the argument by the Information Commissioner) that the test to be applied was not certainty but the balance of probabilities. This is the normal standard of proof and clearly applies to Appeals before this Tribunal in which the Information Commissioner’s findings of fact are reviewed. We think that its application requires us to consider a number of factors including the quality of the public authority’s initial analysis of the request, the scope of the search that it decided to make on the bias of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency with which the search was then conducted. Other matters may affect our assessment at each stage, including, for example, the discovery of materials elsewhere whose existence or content point to the existence of further information within the public authority which had not be brought to light. Our task is to decide, on the basis of our review of all of those factors, whether the public authority is likely to be holding relevant information beyond that which has already been disclosed.” 50. On behalf of Trago Mills Mr Lopez argued that the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that it was improbable that further information was held by the Council was perverse and was based on an incomplete and fundamentally flawed investigation. The basis for those contentions was that the Council had failed properly to scope the search it conducted because it had construed the word “procedures” in the information request too narrowly. We were also taken back to the alleged misstatement by Mr Barnes about there being no performance or conduct issues in respect of X, in an attempt to undermine the credibility of the Council’s response to the information request and the evidence it adduced in this Appeal. Even if the allegation had been substantiated (and we have already made clear that it has not) it is frankly absurd to seek to use it to taint the credibility of Mr Davies, who provided most of the information on the Council’s searches for information. That evidence showed that, even though the Council initially placed an interpretation on the language of the information request that was too narrow, it had corrected its approach by the time the Information Commissioner had concluded his investigation. It also provided further information, which had not been made available to the Information Commissioner, which satisfies us that the scope of the searches made, and the areas of the Council’s records to which they were directed, were more than adequate to justify the conclusion that no information is held beyond that which has already been disclosed. We would go further and say that Mr Davies’s evidence, supplemented by Mr Barnes in respect of email storage, convinced us that the Council had gone to quite extraordinary lengths (and expense) to be as certain as it could be that, if it had retained any further information falling within the scope of the information request, (adopting the widest interpretation of scope contended for by Mr Lopez), it would have come to light. 51. Mr Lopez made further criticisms about the Council’s explanation of its records deletion practices and of the Information Commissioner’s investigation of them. However, the Information Commissioner is not required to consider whether documents have been deleted prior to the date of the information request, only the recorded information that the public authority 16EA/2012/0028; Decision holds at that time. Given what we have said about the broad reach of the searches that have now been undertaken, we believe that this element of criticism is not relevant to our task in the Appeal. 52. Finally, Mr Lopez suggested that the Council’s evidence to the effect that X did not habitually generate a great deal of email traffic and that most of it was likely to have been deleted was no more than conjecture. We think it was much more than that. We are satisfied, on the basis of the evidence adduced, including Mr Davies’ report on the enquiries recently directed to X to see if he knew of any other locations where relevant information might be stored (see paragraph 33 above), that it is not likely, on a balance of probabilities, that further relevant emails were held by the Council at the time of the information request. The Severance Package Request The Relevant Law 53. FOIA section 40(2) provides that information is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of a third party the disclosure of which would contravene any of the data protection principles. 54. Personal data is itself defined in section 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) which provides: “’personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller” Trago Mills does not challenge the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that the requested information in this case did constitute the personal data of the two individuals concerned. 55. The data protection principles are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the DPA. The only one having application to the facts of this Appeal is the first data protection principle. It reads: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully, and in particular shall not be processed unless- (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met …” Schedule 2 then sets out a number of conditions, but only one is relevant to the facts of this case. It is found in paragraph 6(1) and reads: “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 17EA/2012/0028; Decision The term “processing” has a wide meaning (DPA section 1(1)) and includes disclosure. 56. A broad concept of protecting, from unfair or unjustified disclosure, the individuals whose personal data has been requested is a thread that runs through the data protection principles, including the determination of what is “necessary” for the purpose of identifying a legitimate interest. In order to qualify as being “necessary” there must be a pressing social need for it - Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner and others [2008] EWHC 1084 (Admin). The issues we have to consider 57. In determining whether or not disclosure would be contrary to the data protection principles we have to consider: i. whether disclosure at the time of the information request would have been necessary for a relevant legitimate purpose; without resulting in ii. an unwarranted interference with the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the individual concerned. And if we are satisfied on those points we have also to consider: iii. whether disclosure would have been unfair or unlawful for any other reason. 58. In considering fairness and lawfulness we have to bear in mind guidance provided in paragraph 1(1) of Part II of Schedule 1 to the DPA, which provides: “In determining for the purposes of the [first data protection principle] whether personal date are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed.” Our consideration of the evidence 59. The difficulty Trago Mills faces is that the material in the Closed Bundle makes it very clear, as the Council has stated in correspondence with Trago Mills, and in the evidence it presented in this appeal, that X’s departure and the terms of his severance package were not influenced in any way by conduct or performance issues. The contemporaneous documentation which we have considered confirms that this is so. Therefore, even if Trago Mills had established the allegation in Mr Lopez’s skeleton argument to the effect that X had been guilty of “wrongdoing in public office” (which it did not), this would only support a legitimate public interest if the wrongdoing had been so serious that the Council could be criticised for not having taken it into account when considering X’s application for early retirement. Mr Lopez did not put his client’s case that high in this Appeal. He was right not to do so. The allegations made against X fell a long way short of the sort of activity that would have brought that type of consideration into play. 18EA/2012/0028; Decision 60. It is appropriate, at this stage, to deal with the application, made at the start of the hearing, to introduce new evidence in support of Trago Mills’ case. The evidence took the form of a second witness statement by Mr Robertson. Much of it consisted of pure argument, although expressed to be a response to the witness statements of Mr Barnes and Mr Davies. The most significant section (and the only one on which Mr Lopez concentrated when making the application) constituted a challenge to Mr Barnes’ statement (see paragraph 38 above) that there were no issues about performance and conduct considered in relation to X’s severance arrangements. As mentioned in paragraph 22(b) above Mr Robertson had stated in his first witness statement that there were “other matters” which supported his allegation of planning officer wrongdoing. He gave no further explanation at that stage as to what those matters might be or why it was not possible to include them in his evidence at that stage. 61. The new material in Mr Robertson’s second witness statement concerned problems that a Mr Bob Wakeling felt that he had with X and the Council in 2006 and 2007. It was said by Mr Robertson that Mr Wakeling’s experience “mirrors the very substance of my complaint against [X], and in respect of which information on “procedures” was sought”. The issues that concerned Mr Wakeling, even if characterised as being as serious as Mr Lopez claimed, would not take the case into the area where failure to have taken them into account during the negotiations with X would have raised a legitimate public interest in disclosure. Accordingly, given that it was evident to the Tribunal from the pre-reading of the Closed Bundle that the issue of conduct had no impact on the negotiations of X’s severance package, it was not appropriate for time to be spent during the hearing in considering more material that was said to support Trago Mills criticism of X’s conduct. We also felt that other criticisms by Mr Wakeling about the manner in which information on his planning application had been filed by the Council had too remote a connection with the adequacy of the Council’s searches in respect of the Planning Procedures Request to justify being introduced into the evidence before us. We therefore refused permission to Trago Mills to introduce the new evidence on the basis that it had not relevance to the issues we had to decide. 62. A second reason for refusing permission was the late presentation of the evidence. Evidence was exchanged in mid-June. Mr Robertson should therefore have been aware of what Mr Barnes said some 5 weeks before the hearing was due to take place. Although we asked Mr Lopez to explain how soon after that Trago Mills had started to consider seeking further evidence and filing evidence in reply he was not able to tell us any more than that the material relating to Mr Wakeling’s dealings with the Council had not come into Trago Mills’ possession until Friday 20 July, that its discovery had been “pure chance” and that Trago Mills “had not been sitting on its hands”. For his part Mr Robertson said in his second witness statement that he had no business relationship with Mr Wakeling but did not volunteer any information as to what the “pure chance” was, to which Mr Lopez referred, or the steps that his company and its advisers had been taking since mid-June to prepare further evidence or to expand on the “other matters” of which he said he was aware when he signed his first witness statement. The unexplained delay would have justified the refusal of permission in any event. In this case we took into 19EA/2012/0028; Decision account the additional fact that the Council and its advisers had a very short time indeed to consider the new allegations made against it and the substantial clip of correspondence that was said to support them. The late submission of the evidence was therefore likely to compromise other parties. We felt that there was also a danger that, given that a single day had been allocated to the hearing and it would be necessary to accommodate the cross examination of three witnesses and to hear the submissions of all the parties, the introduction of new evidence increased the risk of the hearing not being completed. The significance of the evidence to the issues under consideration did not justify that risk, in our view. Our conclusions in respect of the Severance Package Request 63. For the reasons given above the issue of X’s conduct did not arise in the discussions between the Council and himself about his departure. It therefore carries no weight to support Trago Mills’ argument that there is a strong and legitimate interest in disclosing the requested information. As to other factors supporting a legitimate interest, the parties were in general agreement that: a. X was a senior officer, responsible for significant decisions having potentially serious consequences for those making planning applications or affected by their outcome; b. his role was, to a considerable degree, a public facing one; c. there is a need for transparency in respect of a public authority’s expenditure of public funds, both generally and, more particularly, where the expenditure relates to severance packages for senior officers. 64. Trago Mills also argued that the disclosure sought would relate only to X’s public functions. This was not accepted by the other parties and we think the argument is unsustainable, certainly in the absence of either proof or strong indications that issues about the employee’s wrongdoing had influenced either the decision to enter into a severance agreement or the terms of that agreement. Nor were we attracted by Mr Lopez’s argument, to the effect that the Independent Solicitor’s Report was so flawed in its terms of reference and its judgments that it should not be regarded as serving the legitimate interest in disclosure. We do not think that the point is of any relevance given our view that, in light of our inspection of the Closed Bundle, issues of conduct are not relevant. 65. In respect of the degree of interference with X’s privacy, which must be set against any legitimate interest in disclosure, there was again a level of agreement between the parties that the mere fact that the employer and employee had agreed specific terms of confidentiality would not be determinative. However, even without an express confidentiality provision, an individual would have a reasonable expectation that the terms on which his employment came to an end would be treated as confidential. The question we have to consider is, not whether X’s severance package was a private transaction,(it clearly was), but whether the factors in favour of disclosure should lead us to conclude that, on balance, disclosure would not have represented an unwarranted interference with that right. We do not believe that the evidence of X having recently expressed a strong wish for privacy to be preserved adds material weight to the argument. We make our decision 20EA/2012/0028; Decision on the expectations of privacy held by the reasonably balanced and resilient individual holding the position that X held with the Council. Nor did we attribute any weight, in the other direction, to Mr Lopez’s arguments that the commissioning and ultimate release of the Independent Solicitor’s Report constituted a waiver of confidentiality. 66. Mr Lopez rightly pointed out that X was no longer employed by the Council, so that no working relationship would be jeopardised by disclosure, and that there were no charges or disciplinary proceedings known to be faced by him. However, even taking those factors into account, in addition to those identified above, we do not find that the Council’s duty to be transparent and accountable about the expenditure of public money outweighs the requirement to respect the former employee’s reasonable expectation of privacy. Accordingly we conclude that disclosure would have breached the data protection principles. 67. We have not identified any issues, beyond those considered above, that would have rendered disclosure unfair or unlawful. However, it is enough that the data protection principles would have been breached for us to conclude that the information requested was exempt information under FOIA section 40(2) and that the Information Commissioner was therefore correct to find that the Council had been entitled to refuse this part of Trago Mills’ information request. Conclusion 68. In the light of our findings above we have concluded that the appeal should be dismissed. 69. Our decision is unanimous. 70. In his closing submission Mr Hopkins for the Council invited us to express criticism of the way in which Trago Mills had handled the appeal. We think that it would be unwise for us to express any view on that subject as it is possible that a claim for costs may be made by one or both of the Respondents. We would not want to be seen to have pre-judged, one way or the other, any of the issues that would come into consideration at that stage. [Signed on original] Chris Ryan Judge 22 August 2012 21"

We have decided that information provided by the Second Respondent to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in the course of an investigation conducted by her did not fall within the prohibition against disclosure imposed by section 15 of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993 and was not therefore exempt information for the purposes of section 44 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The request for information and complaint to the Information Commissioner. 2. On 23 and 24 May 2010 the Appellant, Mr Cubells, submitted two requests for information to the Second Respondent (“the Trust”). The requests were lengthy and included a degree of overlap. But, as the matter came before us, there were just four that remained in issue. In summary they sought the following: 1. Copies of all medical records forwarded to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (“the Ombudsman”) in regard to Mr Cubell’s family’s complaint regarding the death of his mother while in the Trust’s care. 2. Copies of all documentation forwarded to the Ombudsman in regard to that complaint. 3. Copies of all communications forwarded to the Ombudsman relating to the death of Mr Cubell’s mother. 4. Copies of emails, letters, written notes, reports, minuted telephone conversations, electronic attachments utilised by the Trust in response to the Ombudsman’s investigation into the death of Mr Cubell’s mother. 3. The requests were made under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), which imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. 4. The first request was refused on the basis that the information was covered by FOIA section 21 (information accessible by other means). Requests 2, 3 and 4 were refused in reliance on the exemption set out in FOIA section 44 (disclosure prohibited under another statute). The Trust maintained that position following an internal review of its initial decision and, following a complaint by Mr Cubells, the Information Commissioner decided that the Trust’s stance had been justified.EA/2011/0183; Decision The Appeal to this Tribunal 5. The Information Commissioner’s decision was set out in a Decision Notice dated 2 August 2011. Mr Cubells appealed to this Tribunal. Initially he challenged just the conclusion reached in respect of FOIA section 21, but he was subsequently given leave to amend his Grounds of Appeal to add a challenge to the Information Commissioner’s conclusion under section 44. 6. For reasons which will become apparent we will deal with the section 21 issue quite shortly and will then consider the application of section 44 to the remaining information requests. Request 1 - FOIA section 21 7. The Trust’s initial position under section 21 was that it had sent to the Ombudsman the same set of medical records that it had previously provided to Mr Cubells under a request under the Access to Health Records Act 1990. Mr Cubells found it difficult to understand why the Ombudsman declined to undertake an investigation. He suspected that the Trust had not in fact sent the Ombudsman all the material that he, Mr Cubells, had inspected. He continued to press his case, relying on an inconsistency which he perceived in the documentary record of the Ombudsman’s consideration of the case. 8. On the first hearing of Mr Cubells’ appeal, on 19 December 2011, the Information Commissioner informed the Tribunal that the Trust had just discovered that certain contemporaneous records of the medical care in question had in fact been omitted from the dossier passed to the Ombudsman. In the light of that information the hearing was adjourned to enable the Trust to be joined as a party and for evidence to be filed explaining the circumstances in which the Trust had given incorrect information to both Mr Cubells and the Information Commissioner and clarifying the extent of the disclosure made to the Ombudsman. 9. Up to the commencement of the adjourned hearing on 30 April 2012 both the Trust and the Information Commissioner continued to rely on section 21 because, they said, Mr Cubells had clearly received all information that had been provided to the Ombudsman plus the additional information that had been inadvertently omitted from the dossier. Mr.Cubell’s point, on the other hand, was that he wanted to know precisely what was ( and therefore what was not) sent to the Ombudsman and that providing him with more information than was sent to the Ombudsman, without identifying which of that information was not sent to the Ombudsman, did not answer his request. However, in the course of the hearing the parties agreed that this part of the appeal should be adjourned to enable Mr Cubells to compare his copy of the medical records with the Ombudsman’s dossier (which by this time had been returned to the Trust) so that he would have aEA/2011/0183; Decision complete picture of exactly what the Ombudsman had received. We have been informed subsequently that the inspection took place and that, as a consequence, Mr Cubells does not wish to pursue that part of his appeal. We do not therefore need to make a decision on the point. Nor do we make any comment on the manner in which the Trust handled this part of the original information request because, as matters transpired, its witness was not given the opportunity to answer questions at the hearing and we did not hear any submission on the point from its advocate. Request 2, 3 and 4 - FOIA section 44 10. In his decision notice the Information Commissioner decided that a prohibition on disclosure imposed by section 15 of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993 (“HSCA”) applied to the Trust, on the facts of this case, and that the information referred to in requests 2 – 4 therefore fell within the exemption set out in FOIA section 44. Under FOIA section 2(3)(h) that exemption is categorised as an absolute exemption. Once the Information Commissioner had decided that it was engaged, therefore, it was not necessary for him to consider any other factors and he therefore concluded that the Trust had been right to refuse the request. 11. The relevant part of FOIA section 44 reads: “(1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it- (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment …” 12. The relevant parts of the HSCA are as follows: “3(1) On a complaint duly made to the [Ombudsman] by or on behalf of a person that he has sustained injustice or hardship in consequence of – (a) a failure in a service provided by a health service body, (b) a failure of such a body to provide a service which it was a function of the body to provide, or (c) a maladministration connected with any other action taken by or on behalf of such a body, The [Ombudsman] may, subject to the provisions of this Act, investigate the alleged failure or other action.” “11 (2) An investigation shall be conducted in private.” “15(1) Information obtained by the [Ombudsman] or his officers in the course of or for the purposes of an investigation shall not be disclosed except- (a) for the purposes of the investigation and any report to be made in respect of it…”EA/2011/0183; Decision 13. The Information Commissioner decided that the information withheld by the Trust fell within the prohibition. He reached that conclusion by deciding that: a. the word “obtained” in HCSA section 15 covered both information which the Ombudsman proactively obtained as part of an investigation as well as information supplied to her; b. the fact that the Ombudsman ultimately decided not to take Mr Cubell’s complaint forward into a full investigation did not take the information outside the scope of the words “…for the purposes of an investigation…”; and c. the withheld information was, as a fact, released by the Trust to the Ombudsman in the context of Mr Cubells’ complaint and was used when deciding whether to investigate it: accordingly it was “obtained… for the purpose of an investigation”. 14. The Information Commissioner went on to consider the relevance of a number of available exceptions to the section 15 prohibition, which the Ombudsman might have exercised her discretion to apply. However, he concluded that he was bound by the Upper Tribunal decision in Ofcom v Morrissey and the Information Commissioner [2011] UKUT 116 (AAC), which was to the effect that neither the Information Commissioner nor this Tribunal should take into account the correctness of a decision by another regulator not to apply an exception. Accordingly the Information Commissioner decided that, because the Ombudsman had not exercised her discretion to allow disclosure of the withheld information, the statutory bar to disclosure continued to apply and the information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 44. 15. Mr Cubells was assisted in formulating his Grounds of Appeal addressing the section 44 issue by Mr Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information. Mr Cubell applied for permission for Mr Frankel to submit written and oral submissions and we decided, notwithstanding objection by the other parties, that we should grant the application. 16. The arguments addressed by Mr Frankel on Mr Cubells behalf may be summarised as follows: a. The prohibition in section 15 creates, and was designed to create, a balance to the wide powers which the Ombudsman has to compel the disclosure of information for the purposes of an investigation, in that it provides reassurance to those supplying information that no improper disclosure of that information will occur. b. Although section 15(1) uses the passive voice (“shall not be disclosed”) the correct construction is that its meaning is that there should be no disclosure by the Ombudsman or her officers. It would be wrong to interpret it as meaning that the prohibition applies to any third party holding information which it happens also to have supplied to the Ombudsman.EA/2011/0183; Decision c. If Parliament had intended such a broad application of the prohibition it may be expected to have made this explicit in the Act itself, which it has not done. d. It may be speculated that the reason why the Parliamentary draftsman was content to leave the passive language in place was that the FOIA had not been enacted at the time and he would have seen no reason to consider the prohibition extending to an NHS body holding information which either related to a third party (and was likely, therefore, to be already bound by an obligation of confidence) or concerned its own procedures and organisation (which it should be free to disclose). e. Section 15 includes an exception (in subsection (1)(a)) to enable the Ombudsman to perform her statutory function but it contains none that would enable an authority susceptible to an investigation by the Ombudsman to disclose, for the purposes of its own statutory functions, any information that had been made available to the Ombudsman for the purposes of an investigation. f. Other exceptions to the section 15 prohibition cover disclosure for the purposes of, for example, proceedings for perjury committed in the course of the Ombudsman’s investigation and proceedings under HSCA section 13 for obstruction of an investigation or contempt: yet no equivalent exception has been provided for information which an authority continues to hold, even if the continued imposition of the prohibition interfered with its other statutory duties. g. The interpretation favoured by the Information Commissioner would, in various sets of circumstances, create a very unsatisfactory result, which Parliament could not have intended: i. If information, once disclosed to the Ombudsman, is then subject to a prohibition on any disclosure by the party who disclosed it, an NHS authority would be prevented from even sharing it with a patient’s GP or another health authority into whose area the patient moved. ii. It might even be said that if a patient’s GP disclosed information to an NHS authority and the authority subsequently disclosed it to the Ombudsman then the GP would find that the information in his or her possession had, from that point, become subject to a restriction. iii. Similarly, information previously supplied by the authority to, for example, a social services department or the police could not then be further disclosed by those bodies (even if this was necessary for the patient’s well-being) once it had been passed on by the authority to the Ombudsman. iv. The prohibition would continue indefinitely, even after the Ombudsman had completed her investigation, and would, for example, prevent an NHS authority from using the information in question in its response to an Ombudsman report, either defending its actions or explaining the stepsEA/2011/0183; Decision it proposed to take in light of criticism contained in the report. v. A person complaining to the Ombudsman would find that he or she was thereafter unable to make any use of information passed to the Ombudsman in support of the complaint, a result that would be inconsistent with the right to “receive and impart information” under Article 10(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. h. The Information Commissioner’s interpretation would also create an inconsistency with HSCA section 15(1)(e), which enables the Ombudsman (but not any other person) to disclose in some circumstances information that is to the effect that a person may constitute a threat to patient health or safety. i. If we considered that there was ambiguity on the point we may obtain guidance (under the principle set out in Pepper v Hart [1993] 1 All E R 42) from a statement made during the passage through Parliament of a predecessor to HSCA by the Minister responsible for it. This made it clear that the intention was to impose a prohibition only on the Ombudsman and her officers and not on any other party who had disclosed information for the purposes of the enquiry. j. The Tribunal should interpret the statutory provisions in issue with a view to giving effect, so far as possible, to the requirement of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (respect for private and family life). An outcome that resulted in a blanket prohibition on the disclosure of information about the medical treatment of a family member would breach Article 8. That outcome should be avoided by the Tribunal complying with the requirement to interpret legislation, so far as possible, in a way that is compatible with convention rights. 17. It will be seen, therefore, that Mr Frankel did not challenge any of the conclusions reached by the Information Commissioner and summarised in paragraph 13 above. His only challenge was that the Information Commissioner had been wrong to treat the prohibition as applying to both the Ombudsman and those providing information to her. The Information Commissioner put his counter argument in quite stark language, asserting in his skeleton argument that: “Section 15 creates an unqualified prohibition on disclosure on the part of any person holding the protected information. In doing so it draws no distinction between the [Ombudsman] and others who may hold the information protected…” 18. Before us Mr Cross, counsel for the Information Commissioner, argued (with the support of the Trust) that we were bound by precedent to reject Mr Frankel’s argument. The authority he relied on was R (on the application of Kay) v Health Service Commissioner [2008] EWHC 2063 (Admin).EA/2011/0183; Decision 19. Kay was a case in which a father had complained to the Ombudsman about the treatment given to his daughter and sought access to all potentially relevant information that might assist him in pursuing his complaint. He also sought the same information from the Trust responsible for his daughter’s care. The report of the case records that the Trust refused, but it contains no further information on that element of the matter (unsurprisingly, as the application to the Administrative Court related to the position of the Ombudsman, not the Trust). The position adopted by the Ombudsman was that she would be prepared to disclose documents on which she was minded to rely in determining the complaint or which might influence her decision. These included clinical notes and records but also other documents such as reports from an External Professional Adviser, a doctor’s report, correspondence and internal communications within the Trust about the complaint or the care of the claimant’s daughter, the conclusions of a clinical adviser and the Trust’s response to the Ombudsman’s enquiries. The Ombudsman had stated that she would not disclose other documents, on which she did not propose to rely, or which would not influence her decision, because she regarded them as not relevant to the complaint that had been referred to her. 20. The judge in Kay, Mrs Justice Dobbs, decided that the Ombudsman was entitled to limit the information to be disclosed in this way and that the withholding of the remaining information did not undermine the fairness of the Ombudsman’s investigation because (quoting with approval the words of Collins J in R (on the application of Turpin) v Commissioner for Local Administration [2001] EWHC Admin 503): “The law as to the requirements of fairness in conducting an investigation is, as it seems to me, clear. The general rule is that a person or body which has to make a decision based on an issue raised by one person against another should normally disclose the material on which it is going to rely or which comes into its possession which may influence its decision to each of the parties so that each party can know what material is available, what matters are likely to be held against them and whether it is necessary for that party to itself put forward material or to make representations to deal with such matters.” 21. Mrs Justice Dobbs then went on to approve the Ombudsman’s proposal to require the applicant to undertake not to use the information that was to be disclosed for any purpose other than that investigation. In that context the judge said: “I take section [15] to mean what it says, namely that information disclosed to the ombudsman in the course of or for the purpose of the litigation shall not be disclosed except for the purposes of the investigation and any report to be made in respect of it. In my judgment that applies to those receiving the information from the [Ombudsman] itself.EA/2011/0183; Decision “This is a jurisdiction where the majority of the information obtained is likely to be confidential and section 15 is clearly in place to protect the confidentiality of the material. It would be an absurd position if the ombudsman was restricted as to the situations in which she could disclose the material, only for the material to be used by others for reasons outside the ambit of the ombudsman’s investigation and report. It cannot in my judgment have been the intention of Parliament that a person could then use the information as he chose, relying on some justification for the use, the damage having been done in the use of the material before any decision as to justification has been taken” 22. Mr Cross relied on this passage and argued that it set out a principle, which was broad enough to cover the facts of this appeal, to the effect that the prohibition in section 15 covers, not just the Ombudsman, but others who are in possession of the same information. He argued that the prohibition must therefore be regarded as extending to both those to whom information was passed by the Ombudsman as well as those from whom the Ombudsman obtained it. 23. In our view the circumstances in which Mrs Justice Dobbs made the judgment on which Mr Cross relies are significantly different from those of the present appeal for two reasons. First, the information to be disclosed in that case had been filtered down from all the information assembled during the investigation to just the information which was relevant to the preliminary conclusion which the Ombudsman had reached, and which therefore needed to be made available to those affected before a final determination was made. That gave the information an additional significance that justified the continuing imposition of an obligation of confidence during the final stage of the decision-making process. Once the decision had been finalised the information would be likely to be disclosed as part of the Ombudsman’s report. 24. The second element of distinction is that, the information having fallen within the section 15 prohibition as a result of it having been obtained by the Ombudsman in the course of an investigation, it remained incumbent on her to maintain its confidentiality, if only for her own self- protection. If she were to release it to a third party without imposing, by undertaking, the same confidentiality imposed on her by statute she would be in danger of breaching the prohibition. 25. We believe that the effect of the differences we have highlighted is that Kay may be distinguished for the purposes of this appeal and that the, admittedly general, statements contained in the passage quoted above should not be regarded as establishing a binding precedent extending to the different facts of this case. The judge was clearly right, if we may say so, to stress the importance of the prohibition extending beyond the Ombudsman to those receiving information from her. ButEA/2011/0183; Decision the judgment says nothing, in our view, that establishes a principle that is broad enough to encompass the facts of this case. 26. In those circumstances we are entitled to return to the arguments put forward by Mr Frankel and consider, with an open mind, whether they establish that the section 15 prohibition does not apply to information in the hands of the Trust. In doing so we also consider the following counter-arguments put forward by Mr Cross. 27. No doubt influenced by Mr Frankel’s explanation of some of the unattractive consequences if the Information Commissioner’s interpretation was favoured, Mr Cross retreated a little from the broad statement quoted in paragraph 17 above. He conceded that the prohibition might not extend to information that did not properly form part of the subject matter under investigation. However, he maintained that, for the purposes of this appeal, there clearly was sufficient connection between the investigation and the information covered by requests 2 – 4 for prohibition to apply to all of it. 28. Mr Cross challenged Mr Frankel’s interpretation of section 15. He said that both the natural meaning of the language of the section and the application of a purposive construction led to the conclusion that the prohibition extended to all those holding information that had been obtained by the Ombudsman in the course of her investigation. He argued that there was no reason why the prohibition should not bind a provider of information and that it would create an absurd situation if the Ombudsman could not disclose information but an NHS authority being investigated could. It would, he said, create a situation where section 44 of FOIA would provide a route to avoid the prohibition in section 15 of HSCA, which would strike at the very basis on which the Ombudsman conducts investigations. 29. We are satisfied that section 15, read as a whole and particularly in the light of the exceptions to the prohibition, (which are clearly focused on the Ombudsman and no one else), should be interpreted as imposing a prohibition only on the Ombudsman and her staff. It may follow, from what we have said above, that the prohibition should continue to apply, or should be imposed, if the Ombudsman needs to disclose any of the information she has obtained to a third party. There is no inconsistency there. The information, once obtained during an investigation, should obviously not be released from the prohibition on disclosure just because it becomes necessary for the Ombudsman to disclose it to a third party. There is no logical reason, however, for the prohibition to be imposed on those holding information that has been shared with the Ombudsman. The profoundly unattractive consequences which Mr Frankel outlined demonstrate the absurdity of such an outcome. 30. In reaching that conclusion we do not feel the need to seek outside assistance, whether from Hansard or the European Convention onEA/2011/0183; Decision Human Rights, because in our view the language of the section is clear when construed in context and in the light of the clear purpose of the provision. 31. We do not think that our conclusion undermines the conduct of the Ombudsman’s investigation. It is required by HSCA section 11(2) to be conducted in private, which will result, directly or indirectly, in the imposition of an obligation on those contributing information or submissions to it to maintain the confidentiality of the process and not, for example, to disclose the lines of enquiry that the Ombudsman may be pursuing or the issues she is putting to those whose actions are being investigated. It does not follow that the basic information, detached from any indication of such lines of enquiries or issues, must remain secret, just because it has previously been made available to the Ombudsman as part of her investigation. And, once a report has been issued (or the Ombudsman has decided not to pursue an investigation – as she had done in this case, before the information request had been refused), the privacy of the investigation also falls away. Conclusion 32. In light of our conclusions above we have decided that the prohibition in section 15 of the HSCA does not extend to the Trust and that it was not therefore entitled to treat the information covered by requests 2 – 4 as exempt for the purposes of FOIA section 44. On that basis the information should have been disclosed and the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law for the purposes of FOIA section 58. Accordingly we allow the appeal and substitute the Decision Notice set out at the commencement of this decision. 33. Our decision is unanimous. [Signed on the original] Chris Ryan Judge 30 May 2012"

These appeals concern the information contained in a record of a telephone conversation between then Prime Minister Tony Blair and then US President George Bush on Wednesday 12 March 2003 concerning the possible invasion of Iraq (which began on 20 March 2003). 2. In early 2003, with Iraq not fully complying with its obligations under United Nations (“UN”) resolutions (in particular resolution 1441) with regard to inspections of its weapons programme and facilities, the UK (along with the US and others) made diplomatic efforts to secure enough votes on the UN Security Council to enable the passing of a further resolution which would give Iraq a final deadline for compliance with earlier resolutions. 3. On 10 March 2003, the French President, Jacques Chirac gave a television interview, during the course of which he announced that France would not support the proposed resolution which gave automaticity for military action. Much of Mr Plowden’s case concerns the UK’s interpretation of Mr Chirac’s words in that interview, and how that interpretation influenced the UK’s decision to go to war against Iraq. In essence he considers that the UK and US misrepresented (or may have misrepresented) President Chirac’s meaning in order to justify abandoning further efforts at securing a UN Security Council resolution. 4. At 11:48 on Wednesday 12 March, Matthew Rycroft, then one of Mr Blair’s Private Secretaries, sent to a number of officials at 10 Downing Street an email entitled “French veto – urgent”. In response to Mr Plowden’s request for information the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (“FCO”) initially withheld this document, but subsequently released it. 5. Later on 12 March 2003, Mr Blair and Mr Bush had the telephone conversation to which the disputed information in this appeal relates. 6. On 13 March 2003, two telegrams were sent detailing diplomatic discussions between the UK and France concerning President Chirac’s comments and the French position. On similar themes and also on 13 March 2003, the FCO memo headed “France and Iraq” was compiled. These documents were also initially withheld, but subsequently released to Mr Plowden. 7. On 14 March 2003, Mr Blair and President Chirac discussed their positions on Iraq. This is set out in the record of their telephone call, which again was initially withheld but subsequently released to Mr Plowden. 4IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 8. On 18 March 2003, Mr Blair proposed to the House of Commons that the UK use all means necessary to uphold UN resolution 1441 and to disarm Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (“WMD”) facilities. 1 Mr Blair’s motion proposed that the House: “ ... regrets that despite sustained diplomatic efforts by Her Majesty’s Government it has not proved possible to secure a second Resolution in the UN because one Permanent Member of the Security Council [France] made plain in public its intention to use its veto whatever the circumstances”. That motion was passed. 9. The war against Iraq commenced on 20 March 2003. The UK ended formal combat operations in Iraq on 30 April 2009. 10. On 15 June 2009, the Government announced the establishment of the Iraq Inquiry, to be presided over by Sir John Chilcot (“the Chilcot Inquiry”). The Chilcot Inquiry officially launched on 30 July 2009. Its final hearings concluded on 2 February 2011. Its report is still awaited. 11. Jack Straw MP, Foreign Secretary at the time of the decision to go to war against Iraq, gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry on a number of occasions. During his evidence on 8 February 2010, Mr Straw was asked “whether it had been agreed between Number 10 and the White House on the afternoon of [12 March 2003] that we would, between us, say it was the French who prevented us from securing a resolution?” 2 Mr Straw referred to the record of the phone call with which this appeal is concerned. He maintained that Mr Chirac’s intervention had made the securing of the requisite Security Council votes “close to impossible”. 12. Three days later on 11 February 2010 Mr Plowden made his request – see below for this particular record. In his notice of appeal he explained that he wished to establish whether there was such an agreement made during 12 March telephone conversation. The Request 13. By an email dated 11 February 2010, Mr Plowden made a request as follows: “…My request under the FoI Act relates to some documents referred to in the transcript of the Iraq Inquiry for 8 February, the afternoon session when Jack Straw was the witness. On page 91, Sir Roderic Lyne referred to a number of messages from France received on 11, 12 and 13 of March 2003 explaining that the British had misinterpreted President Chirac’s words in his TV interview of 10 March. I would like to see the records of these messages, both the written and oral messages, including the record of the telephone call from M Villepin to Mr Straw of 13 March. 1 HOC Hansard 18 March 2003 column 760. 2 Extract from evidence at the Iraqi Inquiry. 5IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS On page 92, Mr Straw said that in the course of his telephone conversation with M Villepin, he (Mr Straw) said that there should be a discussion of these issues at Head of Government level. I would like to know whether this was followed by a discussion between Mr Blair and President Chirac, and if so I would like to see the records of the discussion and any comments on it made by FCO Ministers or officials. On pages 93 and 94, Sir Roderic referred to an agreement made with the White House (Mr Straw’s answer to Sir Roderic makes it clear that this was a discussion between the PM and the President) to say that it was the French who prevented us from securing a resolution. I would like to see the records of that discussion and any comments on it made by FCO Ministers or officials.” 14. The FCO confirmed to Mr Plowden that it held five documents within the scope of the request. Three of the five documents related to the “first tier” of the request (messages from France); one related to the “second tier” of the request (discussion between Mr Blair and President Chirac); and one to the “third tier” of the request (a record of a telephone conversation between Mr Blair and President Bush of 12 March 2003). 15. By letter dated 12 April 2010 the FCO refused to disclose any of the information claiming that all documents were exempt under ss.27(1) and (2) and s.35(1)(a) FOIA (“Refusal Notice”). Mr Plowden asked for an internal review on 28 April. The FCO provided the response to the review by letter dated 6 July 2010 upholding its Refusal Notice. The legal framework 16. FOIA s. 27(1) provides, insofar as is relevant here: (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (a) relations between the United Kingdom and any other State, (b) relations between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or international court... 17. There are two essential elements: a) would disclosure of the information be likely to prejudice international relations; b) if so, does the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweigh the public interest in disclosing it. 18. In relation to the first element we note this is a prejudice-based exemption; the usual principles from Hogan v IC and Oxford City Council [2011] 1 Info LR 588 therefore apply. The requisite prejudice must be real, actual or of substance; the exemption is engaged if disclosure is more likely than not to cause such prejudice, or if there is a very significant and weighty chance of it, even if falling short of 6IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS being more probable than not: Muttit v IC and Cabinet Office (EA/2011/0036) at §40. 19. The threshold in the particular context of s.27(1) was explained by the Tribunal in Campaign Against the Arms Trade v IC and MOD (EA/2006/0040) at §81: “ ... we would make clear that in our judgment prejudice can be real and of substance if it makes relations more difficult or calls for particular diplomatic response to contain or limit damage which would not otherwise have been necessary. We do not consider that prejudice necessarily requires demonstration of actual harm to the relevant interests in terms of quantifiable loss or damage. For example, in our view there would or could be prejudice to the interests of the UK abroad or the promotion of those interests if the consequence of disclosure was to expose those interests to the risk of an adverse reaction from the KSA or to make them vulnerable to such a reaction, notwithstanding that the precise reaction of the KSA would not be predictable either as a matter of probability or certainty. The prejudice would lie in the exposure and vulnerability to that risk.” 20. In relation to the second element (the public interest test) we take note of the Upper Tribunal decision in APPGER v IC and MOD [2011] 2 Info LR 75, where the Tribunal adopted (at §56) the following extract from the Master of the Rolls’ judgment in R (on the application of Mohamed) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2010] EWCA Civ 65 – also see Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman [2001] UKHL 47: “ In practical terms, the Foreign Secretary has unrestricted access to full and open advice from his experienced advisers, both in the Foreign Office and the intelligence services. He is accordingly far better informed, as well as having far more relevant experience, than any judge, for the purpose of assessing the likely attitude and actions of foreign intelligence services as a result of the publication of the redacted paragraphs, and the consequences of any such actions so far as the prevention of terrorism in this country is concerned.” 21. We agree and apply the above principles. Moreover even though a national security exemption has not been claimed for the disputed information in this case we find that we are still subject to the same principles and should accept that the executive branch of Government has expertise and experience in relation to foreign policy matters as well as security matters which the Tribunal cannot match. 22. FOIA ss. 27(2) and (3) provide that (emphasis added): (2) Information is also exempt information if it is confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom or from an international organisation or international court. (3) For the purposes of this section, any information obtained from a State, organisation or court is confidential at any time while the terms on which it was obtained require it to be held in confidence or while the 7IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS circumstances in which it was obtained make it reasonable for the State, organisation or court to expect that it will be so held. 23. As the Tribunal observed in Muttit at §59, s. 27(2) “is a class-based exemption, reflecting the fact that there is an inherent public interest in not breaching another State’s confidences”. 24. We also observe that whether information is confidential information under this exemption is different from the exemption under s.41 FOIA. There is no need to show an actionable breach of confidence. Whether information is confidential is prescribed by sub-section (3). 25. FOIA s. 35(1)(b) provides that: (1) Information held by a government department or by the Welsh Assembly Government is exempt information if it relates to— ... (b) Ministerial communications... 26. This exemption was considered by the Tribunal in Cabinet Office v IC and Lamb [2011] 1 Info LR 782. In ordering the disclosure of the Cabinet minutes concerning the decision to go to war with Iraq, the Tribunal considered the passage of time to be a relevant factor (§73). It also considered the exceptional features of the Iraq war decision to be highly relevant. At §81, the Tribunal found that: “ The very unusual nature of those factors, particularly when viewed in combination, also have the effect of reducing any risk that this decision will set a precedent of such general application that Ministers would be justified in changing their future approach to the conduct or recording of Cabinet debate. This is not to say that it is only in such an extreme case as the present that disclosure should be ordered. It will be for future Tribunal panels to decide whether other sets of circumstances may justify disclosure. We simply decide that on the facts of this case the public interest in disclosure was at least equal, at the relevant time, to the public interest in maintaining the exemption.” 27. In APPGER v IC & FCO EA/2011/0049-51 the Tribunal stated at §146 “ …..should we elevate ss 35(1)(b) and (d) to having the same inherent weight in favour of maintaining the exemptions as that of s.35(1)(c) which reflects a long standing Convention? We consider Blake J was referring to the combination of specificity and convention as establishing a strong weight in favour of maintaining the Law Officer exemption and both of these factors are not present together for subsections (b) and (d). However we are prepared to accept that the weight we should attribute to the s.35(1)(b) and (d) exemptions because of their specificity is higher than for s.35(1)(a), but not as weighty as for s.35(1)(c).” 8IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS We agree and adopt this finding in relation to the inherent weight we should apply to the Ministerial Communications exemption. 28. All of the above exemptions are qualified, meaning that they take effect only where “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” – s.2(2)(b) FOIA. As the Tribunal confirmed in Lamb, “those arguing for disclosure therefore have a slight advantage in that they do not have to show that the factors in favour of disclosure exceed those in favour of maintaining the exemption. They only have to show that they are equal” (§34). 29. When applying the public interest test Mr Hopkins has drawn to the Tribunal’s attention that we need to consider a few principles. 30. First, FOIA applies to information not documents. This principle is well established, but vital to a proper consideration of this appeal. The Tribunal’s task is not to assess the consequences of disclosing the record of the phonecall, but the consequences of disclosing the particular extracts from the information contained in that record. 31. Secondly, in some cases before the IC and/or Tribunal, it is neither proportionate nor meaningful to dissect a requested document on a sentence-by-sentence or paragraph-by-paragraph basis. This, however, is an exceptional case, for the reasons given below. Given the exceptional gravity of the decision to commence war against Iraq, a sentence-by-sentence might be an appropriate approach provided it is meaningful in the context of the Request. 32. Thirdly, on a related note, it is vital that qualified exemptions not be treated as de facto absolute ones. The Tribunal has cautioned against this on a number of occasions, including in its very recent decision in Department of Health v IC, Healey and Cecil (EA/2011/0286 & EA/2011/0287) at §73: “ We would observe that the DOH’s position expressed in evidence is tantamount to saying that there should be an absolute exemption for risk registers at the stages the registers were requested in this case. Parliament has not so provided. S.35 (and s.36) are qualified exemptions subject to a public interest test, which means that there is no absolute guarantee that information will not be disclosed, however strong the public interest in maintaining the exemption.” Complaint to Information Commissioner (“IC”) 33. Mr Plowden complained to the IC on 6 August 2010. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the FCO found a further document within the second tier of the request. On 3 March 2011, the FCO decided to disclose five of the six documents in their entirety, including a note of a discussion between Mr Blair and President Chirac. However, the FCO was not prepared to disclose the note of the telephone conversation between Mr Blair and President Bush of 12 March 2003. 9IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 34. The IC distinguished between those parts of the Blair/Bush note which contained or reflected information provided by President Bush (“the Bush information”), and those parts which did not (“the Blair information”). The IC found that s. 27(1) was engaged with respect to the Blair/Bush note in its entirety. 35. The IC noted his dissatisfaction that the FCO had been inconsistent as to whether it contended that the relevant prejudice “would” or “would be likely to” arise. He considered the FCO’s final position to be that prejudice “would be likely to” arise (§§19-21 DN). He was satisfied that, given the importance of the UK’s relationship with the US, s. 27(1)(a) was engaged (§§24-28 DN). The FCO made no mention of relations with the UN (the “international organisation” under s. 27(1)(b) to which the FCO had initially referred) in its later submissions to the Commissioner. 36. The IC found that s. 27(2) was engaged with respect to the Bush information only, as the remaining information was not “obtained from” the US. Although there was no direct evidence that the US had expressly indicated that the matters discussed should be treated as confidential, the context suggested this to be the US’ expectation (§§30-34 DN). 37. Further, the IC considered s. 35(1)(b) was engaged with respect to the entirety of the Blair/Bush note because it was effectively a ministerial communication from the Prime Minister to the Foreign Secretary (§§36-39 DN). As s. 35(1)(b) was engaged, the Commissioner did not consider s. 36 as the exemptions are mutually exclusive. 38. The IC found that the public interest favoured the maintenance of the exemptions with respect to the Bush information. At §83 DN, the IC concluded that: “ After careful consideration, and in circumstances where the respective public interest considerations are very finely balanced, the Commissioner is of the view that the public interest in maintaining the section 27 exemption to protect the confidentiality of the information provided by the US (in the form of information provided to Mr Blair by President Bush), outweighs, by a significant, but by no means overwhelming margin, the public interest arguments in favour of disclosure of this information, persuasive and weighty though they are.” 39. As regards the remaining information, however, the IC concluded that the public interest in disclosure “appreciably exceeded” that in maintaining the exemptions at ss. 27(1) and 35(1)(b). He considered the public interest in accountability for the decision to go to war in Iraq to be “paramount”; disclosure would provide key information concerning what was discussed between Mr Blair and President Bush only days before military action against Iraq commenced. The Commissioner had regard to the decision of the Tribunal in Lamb, which also concerned information concerning the decision to go to war in Iraq (in that case, the minutes of the relevant meeting of the Cabinet). 10IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 40. The IC concluded at §§87-88 DN: “ In reaching this decision, the Commissioner has taken due account of the factors which, to a significant extent, reduce the strength of the important public interests protected by section 27 and section 35(1)(b). These factors include the fact that, at the time of the request, neither Mr Blair or President Bush remained in office (indeed a different administration was in place in the US and a different Prime Minister was heading the UK Labour Government), and Mr Blair no longer held a key role in domestic politics. In addition, UK forces were no longer engaged in Iraq. Most importantly of all, particularly with regard to section 35(1)(b) there had been a passage of time of almost seven years since the decision which forms the background to this request was taken, and a decision taken by government to have the circumstances surrounding the Iraq War and lessons learned from the same, investigated by a major public inquiry. All of these factors, in the Commissioner’s view, mean that the public interest considerations both for and against disclosing the identified partial information, are at the very least equalised. As the Tribunal confirmed in the aforementioned Cabinet Minutes case, ‘those arguing for disclosure therefore have a slight advantage in that they do not have to show that the factors in favour of disclosure exceed those in favour of maintaining the exemption. They only have to show that they are equal’. In the present case, given the impetus for disclosure generated by the importance of the information concerned, the Commissioner is satisfied that at the time of the request, the complainant was entitled to the slight advantage referred.” 41. Other important factors in the IC’s decision included (a) that the FCO appeared from its own correspondence to be taking a “blanket” approach, i.e. basing its arguments predominantly upon the type of information rather than the particular information (§73 DN); (b) that a record of a comparable conversation between Mr Blair and President Chirac had been placed in the public domain (§75 DN), and (c) that Sir John Chilcot, who presided over the Iraq Inquiry, had commented upon the problems caused by the withholding from the public domain of information about crucial exchanges between Mr Blair and President Bush (§§93-95 DN). 42. The IC accordingly ordered disclosure of the Blair/Bush note, but with the Bush information redacted. The appeal to the Tribunal 43. Mr Plowden appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) on 6 October 2011 against the IC’s decision that the Bush information should be withheld. The FCO appealed against the IC’s decision to disclose the rest of the information. Both considered that the IC had determined the public interest balance wrongly in relation to the parts of the record of the Blair/Bush conversation on 12 March 2003 (“the disputed information”) which were not decided in their favour. 11IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 44. Mr Plowden considered a) the IC’s conclusion that the public interest favoured the maintenance of the exemptions with respect to the Bush information was wrong; b) the IC gave too much weight to the public interest in the UK’s relationship with the US as compared with other countries and/or the UN; c) the IC erred in accepting without evidence the FCO’s judgment that the US would be seriously concerned by disclosure of the Bush information; and d) in relation to the likely effects on the UK’s relations with the US that disclosure of this particular information would not set a precedent for all similar information to be disclosed in future. 45. The FCO appealed against the rest of the IC’s decision. The FCO considered that the IC had got the public interest balance right for the Bush information but wrong for the Blair information. 46. The Tribunal ordered that both appeals be consolidated and heard at the same time. 47. The hearing was held on 28 and 29 March where evidence was heard in open and closed sessions. This is the FTT’s normal practice where evidence is required in respect of the disputed information which by its very nature must remain confidential under FOIA until the Tribunal orders disclosure and the appeal process has been exhausted. 48. The FCO provided evidence through two witnesses. Angus Lapsley is Director for the Americas who advises the Foreign Secretary and Minister of State within the FCO directly and is regularly engaged with counterparts in the United States. David Quarrey is the Afghanistan and Pakistan Co-ordinator and Director, Foreign Policy, National Security Secretariat. He has been working in the Cabinet Office in this role since July 2011. Both witnesses gave evidence in open and closed sessions. 49. Mr Plowden gave evidence on his own behalf. He also called Clare Short who was an MP for many years and a member of the Cabinet and Parliamentary Labour Party at the time the UK went to war against Iraq. The IC did not provide any witnesses. 50. At the end of the hearing the Tribunal directed that the parties could provide final written submissions by 10 April. This was later extended to 17 April 2012. Questions for the Tribunal 51. The IC found that s.27(2) was engaged for the Bush information and that ss 27(1) and s.35(1)(b) were engaged for all the disputed information. Neither appellant is disputing these findings. 12IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 52. If the Tribunal find these exemptions are engaged then the only questions for us are: a) what information is covered by the s.27(2) exemption? b) whether the public interest balance favoured: i) maintaining the s.27(2) exemption (and any other exemptions) for the information covered by the s.27(2) exemption, and ii) disclosing the rest of the disputed information. 53. In relation to the application of the public interest test under s.2(2)(b) the FTT is required to determine whether “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” What exemptions are engaged? 54. The disputed information is an internal note between two ministerial private secretaries recording the main points discussed between President Bush and Mr Blair during a telephone conversation on 12 March 2003. The note had a very limited distribution list. We agree with the FCO and IC that s.35(1)(b) (Ministerial Communications) is engaged for all the information. The disputed information is in the form of a letter written between the Prime Minister’s Private Secretary and the Foreign Secretary’s Private Secretary. 55. We also agree with the FCO and IC that s. 27(1)(a) (International Relations) is engaged. Here there is a prejudice based test. Mr Lapsley explained in evidence that the UK has a uniquely close and privileged relationship with the US. He stated that there was “no comparator” in terms of “breadth and depth” of the UK’s relationship with the US. This relationship is vital to the UK’s national interests. The relationship between Prime Minister and President is the apex of and most important strand of this “special relationship”. The US expects and requires confidentiality as regards the records of the private conversations of heads of state. The US information is characterised by immediacy, frankness, informality and a context of exceptional gravity. In Mr Lapsley’s view disclosure of this information would cause significant damage to these relationships. There would be a significant risk of a “cooling off” or of a reduction in access and candour from the US’ side. Any reluctance by the UK’s international partners to entrust it with confidential information would weaken the UK’s bargaining position. 56. These points were confirmed by Mr Quarrey. He explained the presumption of absolute confidence which such exchanges tend to attract, and the importance to the UK of the US President speaking freely and frankly to the Prime Minister. He confirmed that disclosure of such information would result in a real risk of the US withholding information or seeking to place restrictions on the handling within the UK of US information. Mr Quarrey explained that the UK has a privileged insight into US policy-making beyond that enjoyed by other countries. 13IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 57. The FCO witnesses were unable to show actual evidence of prejudice despite a few disclosures in other matters relating to the US at court and ministerial level. However the Tribunal accepts the evidence of the witnesses and finds that the disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to prejudice the relations between the UK and the US. 58. The IC also found that s.27(2) was engaged for the Bush information. The Tribunal having considered the disputed information and the closed evidence in relation to it find that s.27(2) is engaged for the Bush Information on the same basis as the Commissioner, but that the extent of the Bush information is greater than that found by the IC. 59. In the Tribunal’s view the IC took too narrow a view of the words “confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom” in s.27(2). Although there was no express confidentiality agreement, the circumstances described in evidence in this case make it clear to us that there was an expectation of confidence in relation to the discussions at head of state level in the circumstances of this case and any record of the discussions. However s.27(2) only relates to information “obtained” from President Bush in this case. The disputed information records what President Bush says. That is what the IC describes as the Bush information. However the record also includes a note of whether Mr Blair agreed with what was said without further analysis. In our view this is so closely related to the Bush information that it is difficult to distinguish it in terms of what is or is not caught by s.27(2). If it is not caught then there would be the ridiculous position of say a proposal being put forward being protected from disclosure, but the agreement to that proposal not being so protected, even though that agreement is meaningless without knowing what the proposal was. This could lead to unnecessary or incorrect conjecture or inference. We cannot believe that is what Parliament meant when drafting s.27(2). 60. The disputed information also includes what President Bush and Mr Blair discussed and agreed together without identifying who originated the subject of the discussion. Here it is impossible to distinguish what President Bush actually said. Again we believe that Parliament intended for us to take a common sense approach so that mutual exchanges of this kind can potentially be protected under s.27(2), as well s.27(1)(a). 61. The importance of the distinction between the two sub-sections is that although they are both qualified exemptions one is class based and the other is not. In other words whereas s.27(2) is automatically engaged, s.27(1)(a) has to satisfy a prejudice based test before being engaged. Mr Plowden’s evidence 62. Mr Plowden’s evidence largely challenged the merits of the “special relationship” between the US and UK and the legality and merits of the decision to commence war with Iraq. He also identified what he considered to be deficiencies in the mechanisms for executive decision-making in the UK, for example Mr Plowden suggested that there should be greater scrutiny by the Cabinet and/or Parliament of prime ministerial decisions. 14IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 63. Ms Short explained that she had serious reservations about going to war with Iraq as had many other PLP (Parliamentary Labour Party) colleagues. The ‘red line’ as far as the doubters were concerned was the lack of a specific UN mandate in the form of a ‘second resolution’ authorising the use of force. Mr Blair had promised that there would not be military action without a second resolution. Her view was that UNSCR 1441 did not authorise the use of force. Mr Blair went to great lengths to get the Security Council to agree to a second resolution. Ms Short claims that having failed to persuade a majority of the Security Council to support a draft second resolution Mr Blair’s argument shifted. Firstly the Attorney General’s opinion now found it would be lawful to go to war without a second resolution. Secondly in any case President Chirac had said France would veto any second resolution and therefore it had become impossible to get a second UN resolution. These changed facts, amongst others, persuaded Ms Short to support the Cabinet decision to go to war. 64. Ms Short later obtained a transcript of the Chirac interview. In her view this made it clear that France would vote against any resolution that truncated the Blix process (UN weapons inspectors) or allowed the US and UK to declare war without specific UN authority. However President Chirac also said that, if after a few months, the inspectors found that there was no guarantee of Iraq’s disarmament it would be for the Security Council to decide the right thing to do (and in his words) “but in that case, of course regrettably, war would become inevitable. It isn’t today.” Ms Short considers that this statement cannot be reconciled with the Government’s assertion that President Chirac had said France would always vote against and if necessary veto any resolution authorising the use of force, then or at any time in the future. 65. Ms Short also points out to us that she became aware that the disputed information had a very limited distribution or circulation list. She explained that such notes are usually circulated more widely around Whitehall in accordance with the Ministerial Code. However in the run up to the Iraq war they ceased, in her understanding, to be circulated so widely. Even the opinion on whether it would be legal to go to war was not circulated to members of the Cabinet in the usual way. She suggests that the reason is not so much about national security but rather political security. 66. In Ms Short’s view the Americans did not need a second UN resolution to satisfy their domestic needs. However Mr Blair wanted legitimacy for a decision to go to war in order to ensure he had the backing of his party. The stumbling block was legal authority without a second UN resolution. This was overcome by the Attorney-General’s final legal opinion, the alleged position of the French veto over any resolution and briefing against Hans Blix in order to discredit his investigations. 3 The war in Iraq had profound results which led to the setting up of the Chilcot Inquiry. Ms Short considers the conversation between Mr Blair and President Bush would provide an important contribution to understanding how this happened, particularly because of the email of 12 March 2003 which she had not seen before this hearing. 3 Transcript day 2 page 65 lines 13 and 14 and page 77 lines 2 to 5. 15IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 67. At 11.48 on 12 March 2003, before the telephone conversation between President Bush and Mr Blair later that day, an email was sent by the Prime Minister’s Private Secretary to other staff at No.10 and one other marked ‘high’ importance and headed the ‘French veto – urgent’ as follows: “ The French Ambassador has just called, on instructions from the Elysee, to say that Chirac’s comment ‘Whatever happens, France will vote no’ needs to be read in the context of what he said immediately before about 2 hypotheses – either our resolution gets nine votes or it doesn’t. In other words, the Ambassador claims that it is not the case that he said that he would vote no against any resolution.” 68. Ms Short says it is inconceivable that Mr Blair would not have known about this email before his telephone discussion with President Bush later that day. 69. In summary Ms Short considered that at best Mr Blair was economical with the truth in order to get the necessary Cabinet and Parliamentary support to declare war on Iraq in March 2003, albeit sincere in his desire to do the best for the country. Her view is that the significance of the war is such that there is a very weighty public interest in knowing whether Mr Blair and President Bush discussed, during their conversation on 12 March, the way they would present the French position. 70. Mr Plowden says that there was little chance of getting a second resolution passed with the necessary 9 votes needed and therefore the UK deliberately set out to blame the French position for why they had to proceed without such a resolution. He explained that one reason for haste was that the military timetable was in conflict with the diplomatic timetable. 4 71. It is not for this Tribunal to determine what the French position was or whether there was an alleged misrepresentation by Mr Blair to the Cabinet, PLP and Parliament of President Chirac’s stance on the securing of a further UN Resolution. That may be a matter for the Chilcot Inquiry. Our role is only to determine whether the controversy surrounding this amounts to a public interest factor we need to take into account in this case and if so what weight to give to the factor. The FCO’s evidence 72. Mr Lapsley in previous roles and his current role has direct daily experience with liaising with senior US officials. His evidence can be summarised as follows: a) There is a heightened public interest in matters surrounding the UK’s military action in Iraq in the light of the controversial nature of the UK’s intervention in Iraq. However this is outweighed by the prejudice to the UK’s relationship with the US if the information in this case was disclosed. 4 Hans Blix reference from the Chilcot Inquiry pages 270 and 288 lines 8 to 12. 16IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS b) The relationship has a level of intimacy, trust and confidence unparalleled in our dealings with other countries in respect of the UN, NATO, intelligence sharing and many other important matters. c) Maintaining the strength and trust of the relationship with the US is vital to the UK’s national interest. d) The relationship between the UK Prime Minister and the US President represents the very apex of the networks of links between the UK and the US and is the most important link between the two countries and has “huge value” to the UK’s national interests. e) Although there is no formal confidentiality agreement for private conversations at Heads of State level, there is a presumption of confidentiality underpinned by a number of factors including: i) Immediacy and frankness of exchanges and the informality with which these exchanges are reported; ii) The context in which the exchange took place particularly in this case (subject of exceptional gravity); iii) It would be a serious breach of diplomatic etiquette to disclose one government’s view of another; iv) The particular culture and attitudes of the US government which has a strong culture of confidentiality and expectation of confidentiality. f) Disclosure of the disputed information would cause significant damage to the relationship between the US and UK governments and relationship between the US President and UK Prime Minister where they feel free to think out loud and effectively to formulate policy together subject to state ratification. g) There would be a significant risk of a “cooling off” in the extent to which the US administration cooperated with and confided in the UK government, although there was no evidence that this had happened so far despite disclosures in other legal proceedings and elsewhere, albeit not between a UK Prime Minister and US President. h) The knowledge that the type of conversation involved could be liable to disclosure would be likely to have an adverse or “chilling effect” on such conversations and their recording. i) Our relationships with other countries would be adversely affected if it were seen that our degree communications with the US had diminished. j) The Chilcot Inquiry meets any public interest need for transparency. 17IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 73. When Mr Lapsley was asked about what he thought would be the extent of the expected damage if there was disclosure he did not think there would be a reduction in intelligence sharing of a kind which would threaten the UK’s security. 5 74. We note that although the FCO originally argued in the Refusal Notice that disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to have a harmful effect on US/UK relations there was no evidence provided to the Tribunal that suggested this had happened following the disclosures at the Chilcot Inquiry. 75. Mr Quarrey who had spent time in 10 Downing Street as one of the PM’s Foreign Policy Private Secretaries explained that the Prime Minister and US President spoke regularly on matters within his remit. He said “their discussions were conducted with a presumption of absolute confidence.” He took notes of these conversations and circulated the record in the form of a letter to a limited senior readership in order to inform Whitehall colleagues of US thinking, the Prime Minister’s views and the action points agreed. In his view even to have raised the question of their confidentiality with the US would have raised concerns about the extent to which the Prime Minister and President could speak completely frankly. Records of conversations were given protective markings under the UK system of classification. In general, they would be marked in most cases “CONFIDENTIAL”, and in some cases “SECRET”. Mr Quarrey explained the “security” classification covers information whose disclosure is likely to: a) Raise international tension; b) Damage seriously relations with friendly governments; c) Threaten life directly, or seriously prejudice public order, or individual security or liberty; d) Cause serious damage to the operational effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the continuing effectiveness of highly valuable security or intelligence operations; e) Cause substantial material damage to national finances or economic or commercial interests. The “confidentiality” classification covers information whose disclosure is likely to: 1. materially damage diplomatic relations; 2. prejudice individual security or liberty; 3. cause damage to the operational effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the continuing effectiveness of highly valuable security or intelligence operations; 4. work substantially against national finances or economic or commercial interests; 5. impede the investigation or facilitate the commission of serious crime; 6. impede seriously the development or operation of major government policies; 7. shut down or otherwise substantially disrupt significant national operations. 5 Transcript Day 1 page 107 lines 17 to 23. 18IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 76. Mr Quarrey considered that the release of the disputed information would seriously worry the US administration and would risk it reconsidering the way in which it speaks to the UK Government, including the way in which exchanges take place at Head of State or Government level. It risks the UK losing a particularly privileged position vis-à-vis the US. In any case he says the Chilcot Inquiry has examined the issue that Mr Plowden is concerned about and provided a number of examples where Mr Blair, Mr Straw and others had given relevant evidence before the Inquiry. 77. Both of the FCO witnesses accepted that there could be exceptional circumstances where notes of conversations between a UK Prime Minister and US President justified disclosure if it was uncontentious and the US agreed to disclosure, but the Iraq war was not such a circumstance. The public interest test 78. We should remind ourselves of the actual request we are considering: In pages 93 and 94, Sir Roderic referred to an agreement made with the White House (Mr Straw’s answer to Sir Roderic makes it clear that this was a discussion between the PM and the President) to say that it was the French who prevented us from securing a resolution. I would like to see the records of that discussion and any comments on it made by FCO Ministers or officials The FCO says that it holds one document with that description which is the disputed information – the note of the telephone conversation of 12 March 2003. Factors in favour of disclosure 79. Mr Plowden puts his case in the following nutshell: “ going to war is the most important decision a country can take. The invasion of Iraq was and is widely believed both in Britain and abroad to be illegal and immoral. It led to thousands of British casualties, the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians and untold other sufferings. The invasion increased the threats to our national security: the attacks on London on 7 July 2005 were made by people angered by this action and so too, apparently, were other planned attacks which the security forces have thwarted. The claim used to justify the invasion, that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had failed to comply with UN Security Council mandatory resolutions requiring Iraq to rid itself of such weapons, turns out to have been mistaken. Even if there had been good grounds for that belief at the time, peaceful means of getting rid of these weapons through the work of the UN’s inspectors and by other peaceful diplomatic efforts had not been exhausted. All this is already pretty well known. The question which is still to some extent obscure, and on which documents whose disclosure I have requested might throw light, is whether the British prime 19IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS minister and foreign secretary deliberately misrepresented the French position in order to justify the invasion.” 6 80. During the course of the proceedings and in his final submissions it was clear that Mr Plowden was looking for any information that could help understand why the UK went to war with Iraq. 81. In our view Mr Plowden provides a very weighty public interest indeed in favour of disclosure. We make this finding even though the FCO witnesses downplayed the importance of a decision to go to war, which we find difficult to accept. Also in our view, particularly from the evidence in this case, the circumstances surrounding a decision by a UK government to go to war with another country is always likely to be of very significant public interest, even more so with the consequences of this war. 82. The FCO acknowledge the strength of the public interest in transparency about, and accountability for, the UK government’s decision to commence war against Iraq because it would provide key information concerning what was discussed between Mr Blair and President Bush only days before military action against Iraq commenced. Factors in favour of maintaining the exemptions 83. The inherent public interests in the three exemptions engaged represent the principal factors in favour of maintaining the exemptions in this case. There is a very weighty public interest in the Tribunal’s extended definition of the Bush information not being disclosed for the reasons given by the FCO’s witnesses. The likelihood of relations with the US being prejudiced by disclosure of confidential information provided by President Bush to Mr Blair just before war with Iraq was declared is very high indeed. 84. The whole of the disputed information is subject to s.27(1)(a). There has been expert evidence that any disclosure could lead to a reduction in information sharing generally which would in turn lead to the severe prejudice of the UK on security and diplomatic levels. Although Mr Plowden questions this, following the approach of other Tribunals set out in §§ 20 and 21above, we accept the evidence of the senior civil servants given in this case. This again is a very weighty factor against disclosure. 85. The record of the discussion on 12 March took the form of a ministerial communication. The inherent weight of this exemption only adds to the weight of the factors against disclosure. Public interest balance 86. Before undertaking this exercise we note that Mr Hopkins argues it is axiomatic that, in considering the engagement of exemptions and the public interest test, the focus must be on the particular information, rather than the type of information. 6 Open Bundle pages 85 and 86 20IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS This is not to say that the latter is irrelevant. For example, the IC and FCO both agree that disclosure of any information from a record of this type is likely to result in an adverse diplomatic reaction from the US. We agree which is why we find that the claimed exemptions are engaged – see above. However, where (as here) a sentence-by-sentence approach is called for, and where there is exceptionally strong public interest in the disclosure of the information – see below, then it will not do simply to say that nothing from a record of a conversation between a UK Prime Minister and a US President should be disclosed. Rather, it is important to ask, with respect to each sentence: what is it about this particular information which would additionally (i.e. over and above the fact that it comes from a record of a Prime Minister-President conversation) prejudice international relations such that the public interest in disclosure is outweighed? 87. In relation to these principles we note that with respect to the Blair information, the FCO has (a) focused too much on type and insufficiently on particularity, and (b) adopted an approach which is tantamount to saying that, as regards the US (or at least as regards communications with the US at head of state level), no information which engages ss. 27(1) or (2) should ever be released. In other words, when it comes to the US, the FCO appears to treat qualified exemptions as absolute ones. 88. These points are borne out by the evidence before the Tribunal. Ms Short’s evidence, for example, was that Gus O’Donnell (then Cabinet Secretary) effectively adopted the position that “anything to do with the Americans should not be published”. 89. Further, the FCO was clear that it applied an exceptionality threshold for the disclosure of any information of the sort contained in the record of the disputed information. When asked under what sorts of circumstances information falling within s. 27(1) might be released, Mr Lapsley and Mr Quarrey gave examples of anodyne information (which Mr Quarrey accepted was unlikely to be recorded in the first place) or information which the US agreed could be disclosed. To the extent that either scenario is realistic, it is of no assistance here, because s. 27 would not be engaged in such circumstances. In our view the tenor of the FCO’s case is that when it comes to the US, no information of the sort with which this Tribunal is concerned should ever be released. 90. Bearing these points in mind we are faced with a very difficult task. The strength of the weight of the factors for and against disclosure, are very high in this case. 91. The main public interest in favour of disclosure in effect played a large part in the setting up of the Chilcot Inquiry. The decision to go to war with Iraq was of exceptional gravity and controversy. Information that can provide a better understanding of the events leading up to and how we made that decision is in our view subject to an exceptionally strong public interest in disclosure. However no party in this case is suggesting that the Inquiry will not be able to do substantially the job it is tasked with. In fact Ms Short speaks very highly of some of its members. It has still to report but is expected to do so in the autumn. We know that it heard evidence about the subject matter of this case and has seen the disputed material. However the then Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell would not 21IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS give the Inquiry the right to publish the disputed information although it would appear the Inquiry will be able to refer to it and draw conclusions from it. There was evidence that one reason for the delay in publication of the report is because the Inquiry has approached the new Cabinet Secretary as to whether he still wishes to maintain Gus O’Donnell’s position on disclosure of the disputed information and other documents. However at the time of the Request this was not necessarily a factor. Whatever the position there is a strong expectation that Chilcot will address the public interest expressed so clearly by Mr Plowden above, even if this does not lead to the actual disclosure of the disputed information. 92. Therefore in our view the strength of this exceptional public interest in disclosure is lessened because Chilcot is dealing with it, albeit it is unlikely to be able to disclose the actual document and there are continuing delays in publication. 93. The public interest in favour of maintaining the exemption is also exceptionally strong, namely that it could prejudice the relations with our main ally, the US. However there is no actual proof although we accept the expert opinion of the FCO witnesses. Moreover we note that despite the revelations from the Chilcot hearing in relation to the disputed information the FCO witnesses were not able to give examples of any prejudice which had arisen since those disclosures. Also we take into account the matters referred to in the Decision Notice at §40 above including that neither participant in the 12 March 2003 conversation was in office at the time of the Request and that our troops had left Iraq by that time. These matters in our view go to lessening the strength of this public interest. We do not consider that the disclosure of the President Chirac/Mr Blair conversation further weakens the exemption in the circumstances of this case. 94. Applying these factors to the disputed information and the evidence in this case, we take a similar approach to the IC in respect of the Bush information (with our wider interpretation) and the Blair information. We are of the view that we should consider the disputed information on a sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph basis in the circumstances of this case. 95. We agree with the IC that the weight of the public interest in maintaining the exemptions for the Bush information (with our wider interpretation) narrowly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The fact that the s.27(2) FOIA exemption is engaged for this information, in our view, tips the balance. 96. For the Blair information (where only ss.27(1)(a) and 35(1)(b) are engaged) we find that the public interest balance is the reverse and that the public interest in disclosure narrowly outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemptions. Conclusion 97. Our findings on the public interest balance mean that parts of the record of the telephone conversation between President Bush and Mr Blair on 12 March 2003 must be disclosed. These parts are identified in the Decision at the commencement of these reasons and must be disclosed to Mr Plowden within 30 days of the date of this decision. 22IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No.s EA/2011/0225 & 228 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 98.

"80","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2011/0043 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50277373 Dated: 10 February 2011 Appellant: Mr William Thackeray Respondent: The Information Commissioner On the papers Date of decision: 18 May 2012 Before CHRIS RYAN (Judge) and MICHAEL JONES RICHARD FOX Subject matter: Confidential information s.41IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2011/0043 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION Background Information 1. We start by putting this Appeal into context. In the Tribunal’s decision in case EA/2011/0082 and 0083, promulgated on the same date as this decision, we identified a number of requests and chains of request sent by the Appellant, Mr Thackeray, to the Common Council of the City of London (“the Authority”). This appeal arises from the chain or requests identified there as the “Internal Communications Chain”. It led to a request for information about the Authority’s dealings with various organisations connected to the Church of Scientology. The request was made under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), under which any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed if the public authority holds the information and, if so, to have the information communicated to him or her. 2. The scope of the request was narrowed during the course of correspondence between Mr Thackeray and the Authority and some of the requested information was then released by the Authority. Mr Thackeray complained to the Information Commissioner about some of the information, which continued to be withheld, and the Information Commissioner, in a Decision Notice dated 10 February 2011, decided that the exemptions claimed by the Authority had been correctly applied to some documents, but not to others. This Appeal 3. Mr Thackeray has appealed to this Tribunal on only one point. He has said that the Information Commissioner was in error in deciding that FOIA section 41 (third party confidentiality) had the effect of exempting two of the withheld documents. One of those documents has subsequently been disclosed. As the Appeal comes to us, therefore, it concerns just one document, an internal email sent by one member of staff of the Authority to another reporting the substance of a telephone conversation with a third party. The Information Commissioner did not provide information on document content in his Decision Notice because, he said, this would have undermined the integrity of the withheld information. However, the document had been made available to the Information Commissioner during his investigation andhe had therefore been able to take the contents into account in reaching his decision. He identified it simply as “document 35”. We propose to do the same. 4. By agreement between the parties the appeal was determined on the papers, without a hearing, which we considered was an appropriate procedure to adopt. The appeal was stayed for a considerable period, pending resolution of a procedural issue affecting this appeal and others instigated by Mr Thackeray. The reply submissions filed by Mr Thackeray included issues that the Information Commissioner considered were new and should not have been raised at that stage. However, he submitted submissions in response to them and we agreed that, in those circumstances, it was not appropriate or proportionate to allow yet further submissions from Mr Thackeray. We were satisfied that the issue had by that stage been fully and fairly aired and did not believe that further submissions would assist us in our determination. Relevant law 5. FOIA section 41 provides that information is exempt from the disclosure obligation in section 1 if: “(a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority); and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person.” 6. The test for breach of confidence is obtained from the well known case of Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Limited [1968] FSR 415. It requires three elements: a. the information in question must have the necessary quality of confidence; b. it must have been passed by the confider in circumstances that gave rise to an obligation of confidence; and c. detriment would be suffered by the confider by unauthorised use or disclosure by the recipient 7. Section 41 is an absolute exemption (FOIA section 2(3)(g)), which means that, once a decision has been made that it applies to information, it is not necessary to go on to balance the public interest in disclosure against the public interest in maintaining the exemption (as in the case of other exemptions). However, it is well established that, in deciding whether a potential breach of confidence would be “actionable” for the purpose of section 41, consideration must be given to any defence that might be available to the public authority. One such defence is that the public interest in disclosing the information in question outweighs the public interest in maintaining confidentiality. Analysis of the issues8. The Information Commissioner decided that the information recorded in document 35 had been obtained by the third party who had participated in the recorded conversation and that it included information having the necessary quality of confidence to satisfy the first part of the Coco v Clark Test. He also concluded that the information had been confided to the Authority in circumstances that gave rise to an obligation of confidence and that its disclosure would lead detriment for the confider. 9. Mr Thackeray, (who for obvious reasons had not had the benefit, which we have had, of inspecting document 35) suggested that, although it might record some information passed by a third party to the Authority, it might also contain other information that did not fall into that category. He provided, as examples, the names of the sender and recipient and, possibly, any opinion recorded in it. We can say, from our own inspection of the document, that it contains no names that are not already covered by the Information Commissioner’s decision under FOIA section 40 (personal data of a third party), which has not been appealed. Nor does it contain any opinion that might take it outside the meaning of confidential information. 10. We have considered the contents of the document and the circumstances in which, it says on its face, the information was obtained. We are satisfied, on that basis, that the Information Commissioner’s analysis was correct and that a breach of confidence claim could be sustained against the Authority if it had disclosed it other than under the FOIA. We reject the argument by Mr Thackeray that the exemption was not engaged because document 35 was created by the Authority. The document may have been created by an employee of the Authority but the information contained in it had certainly been obtained from a third party, being the person to whom the writer of the document had spoken. 11. The Information Commissioner went on to consider whether the notional confidentiality claim would have been defeated by a defence based on the public interest in disclosure outweighing the public interest in respecting confidences. Although the Information Commissioner acknowledged the public interest in being informed about the Authority’s relationship with the Church of Scientology (particularly on the subject of business rates) he concluded that it was outweighed by the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the particular information provided to it by the third party in this case. 12. Mr Thackeray challenged the balancing exercise because of the importance, in his view, of uncovering information about the Church of Scientology. He also attempted to develop an argument based on what he considered was the inconsistent treatment of other material. However, we consider that the Information Commissioner’s decision may not fairly be criticised for the approach he adopted to other material containing other information. Overall, we were satisfied thatthe Information Commissioner had not fallen into error when assessing the weight to be given to the factors for and against disclosure and that, notwithstanding the concern felt by many about the activities of the Church of Scientology, it cannot be said that this would establish a public interest justification for disclosing the information provided by the confider of the information recorded in document 35. Conclusion 13. For the reasons set out above we conclude that the Authority was justified in relying upon section 41 when refusing to disclose the information recorded in document 35. The appeal should therefore be dismissed. 14. Our decision is unanimous. Chris Ryan Tribunal Judge 18 May 2012"

Dated this 9th day of May 2012 Judge Chris Hughes [Signed on original] 3Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 REASONS FOR DECISION The request for information 1. On 14 November 2010 the Appellant wrote to Northumberland County Council (""the Council "") exercising his rights under the Freedom of Information Act ("" FOIA "") seeking records and documents the Council held regarding the 681 bus services between 14 May and 14 November 2010. 2. The Council responded providing certain information on 20 December 2010. Following a review on 26 January 2011 it confirmed its position that it had no more material to disclose. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner that all material had not been disclosed. Following a preliminary investigation the Commissioner concluded that all material falling within the scope of the request had been disclosed. At that point the Appellant disclosed four items he possessed which fell within scope including correspondence between the Council and his MP; he expressed the view that: “the Council has withheld or destroyed correspondence which confirms the depth of opposition to its highly unpopular bus cuts.” 3. The Commissioner wrote to the Council on 12 September 2011 seeking further explanations and information. The Commissioner was informed that the Council’s policy was that all business-critical information was stored on the Customer Relations Management facility on the network rather than on individual PCs. The former Head of Transport, to whom the MP had written, had left the Council in March 2011 and his hard drive was wiped on his departure. Incoming correspondence was handled through the CRM system; however this held data for only three months. The Council had provided all the information matching the search request that it could find. 4. In his decision notice the Information Commissioner concluded that the Council had at one time held information relevant to the request which it had not disclosed but that it did not now do so and that in his view the Council held no further information which it had failed to disclose. He stated:- “….. the Information Commissioner can see no gain in the Council claiming that it does not hold these four pieces of correspondence if in fact it does, given its explanation that it failed to disclose them due to an oversight . Further, the Council is aware that the complainant has his own copies of the four letters in question, such that there is nothing to be gained by it withholding them at this stage. Given his 4Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 thorough investigation, together with the wiping of the relevant former managers hard drive and the fact that correspondence is only held on its CRM system for a period of three months, the Information Commissioner is satisfied that the Council did hold these letters at the time of the request but has since deleted them from it systems and no longer holds them. The Information Commissioner is mindful that the Council's failure to provide the complainant with copies of these four letters does cast some doubt as to whether it holds other relevant information about the bus service which it has also missed; however, he has specifically questioned the Council about this and received its categorical confirmation that it does not hold any further information. On the balance of probabilities, the Information Commissioner has concluded that the Council does not hold any further information relevant to the complainant's request; however, he would remind the Council of the need to undertake a thorough and rigorous search in response to future information requests."" The appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant was dissatisfied and on 18 November 2011 lodged his appeal. The basic argument underpinning his appeal was that he had in his possession a further e- mail dated 20 October 2010 which the Council had not disclosed but which he had obtained from another source. He stated :- ""So the basis of the decision notice has now been proved to be wrong. I would add that this e-mail is now the fifth documented failure to disclose by the Council. So I vehemently contest the Information Commissioner's decision that these acts were unintentional. I believe the Information Commissioner's judgement of the balance of probabilities is seriously flawed. The latest withheld e-mail contains highly controversial plans to decimate local bus services months after. If the Council had disclosed this it would have caused an outcry in the press and mobilised public opposition. The Council know I am a public transport campaigner with close links to the press. I enclose a local newspaper article about me from 2007 in which the same Council were highly embarrassed by damaging disclosures obtained through a FOIA request. This time they deliberately withheld five documents including the 20 October e-mail. I would add to my FOIA request for this information was addressed 5Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 personally to [name redacted], the same individual whose key e-mail of 20 October was then withheld. Yet the ICO’s decision notice confirmed [name redacted] hard drive was fully intact at the time of my request. In all the circumstances I submit that the balance of probabilities must indicate a section S.77 offence. "" 6. The Appellant in his appeal and subsequent documents has submitted that the Council holds further documents and that the Commissioner should have criticised aspects of the Council’s behaviour in his decision. He also claims that the Commissioner should have exercised his discretion differently. 7. The Commissioner has resisted the Appeal on the basis that his inquiry was robust and the production of the fifth document was not proof that it was held by the Council at the time of the Commissioner’s decision. He argued that the relevant burden of proof for an offence under S77 (altering etc records with the intent to prevent disclosure) required intent on the part of the Council and had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He was satisfied that there was no such intent. 8. The Council responded by stating that the additional email was not deliberately withheld, that the reason that it was not supplied was either oversight or as a result of its deletion from the hard drive of the former transport manager, and that:- “The content of the email is not of a controversial nature and discusses the same thought processes that were discussed in other emails made available to Mr Gilbert as part of his FOI request.” The question for the Tribunal 9. The Commissioner’s decision explicitly found that at the time of the request the Council held material which it did not disclose and has subsequently deleted (DN 31) but that at the time of his decision, the Council did not hold any further information within the scope of the request (DN33). Although the Appellant has raised the question of the Commissioner’s discretion; on analysis it is clear that the issue he is raising is the finding of fact that no more information is held. 10. The issue the Tribunal must resolve is whether the DN is accordance with law and to do so it may review any finding of fact upon which the decision is based (FOIA S58). 6Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 Evidence 11. The Council provided a witness statement from Mr McBride, who carried out the initial search for information and from Mr Cusack who carried out the internal review. The initial request had been directed to the transport manager, after it was acknowledged it was allocated to Mr McBride to action. He circulated a communication to all members of the integrated transport unit ""who are either known to be involved in the discussions relating to service 681 or may have been party to documents or other forms of relevant evidence during this period "". Further he made a search of the Council’s CRM using a range of search terms relating to the bus, the operator and the route. The product of the searches was then pulled together, checked and redacted before being sent to the Appellant. In carrying out the review Mr Cusack considered the material that had been sent, checked all the sources used by Mr McBride and satisfied himself that all the documents found had been included. He confirmed that there were no other departments likely to have been involved and holding information within the terms of the request by the appellant. 12. The third witness statement from the Council, by a Mr Coe, produced to the Tribunal a copy of an e-mail sent by the then transport manager of the Council to his opposite number working for Cumbria County Council relating to surveys on the use of the 681 service, consultations concerning its future and indicating that he would be replying to the MP explaining the issues. 13. The explanation of the Council remained that given to the Information Commissioner before he concluded his decision notice; that is that information held by the then transport manager had not been fully integrated into the systems which were searched and his hard drive was wiped after he left the Council so it was now no longer possible to determine whether there was any other information which had been held at the time of the original request but that no further information was now held. Analysis 14. In deciding whether or not the Council holds information for the purposes of FOIA the civil standard of the balance of probabilities is applied (Bromley & others v The Information Commissioner and the Environment Agency EA/2006/0072). 7Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 15. At the heart of this case is a difference in perspective between the Appellant and the Council. The Appellant considers that the Council viewed the entire request of the background circumstances as a matter of great controversy and that it had ""Something to hide"". The perspective of the Council however was very different. The transport department had a budget of approximately £16 million to spend on supporting transport. Under the current financial circumstances it would wish to ensure that the public benefit from its expenditure was as great as possible. Considering the future of the 681 bus service was for the officers concerned part of their routine day-to-day business which they carried out in consultation with Parish councils, the adjoining county council and other interested parties. Officers considered the results of passenger surveys, the expenditure concerned and possible alternative solutions. 16. The Appellant invited the Tribunal to draw inferences from the failure of the Council to disclose information it held at the time of the request (the original four documents) and from his subsequent disclosure of a fifth document, to conclude that the Council deliberately suppressed information, destroyed it in breach of S.77 FOIA, and may continue to hide information. 17. The Tribunal is unable to draw such inferences. The evidence of the documents and from the witness statements clearly shows that there was no desire to suppress the information and that the reason the five documents were not disclosed originally was administrative error and that the computer hard drive where they were likely to have been stored in the Council at the time of the request had, by the time of the Commissioner’s Decision Notice, been erased. Conclusion and remedy 18. In his decision notice the Information Commissioner concluded that the Council had at one time held information relevant to the request and that it did not now do so and that in his view the Council held no further information which it had failed to disclose. He had done this after an investigation in which he had challenged the Council about the shortcomings of its management of the request and sought proper explanations for its inability to provide documents of which the appellant had copies. He accepted the Council's explanation that it missed the documents during its search process, that the nondisclosure was a simple oversight and that the hard-drive which had held the data had now been erased. The Commissioner expressed his concerns 8Appeal No: EA/2012/0274 about the need to carry out thorough and rigorous searches in response to requests. The further evidence submitted to the Tribunal by the Council, including the copy of the fifth document and evidence as to how the Council sourced the document for submission to the Tribunal, was all entirely consistent with this account. The Tribunal is satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the Decision Notice is correct and that by the time the Commissioner issued his decision the Council no longer held any information which had not been disclosed to the Appellant. 19. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this appeal. 20. The Tribunal observes that the Council’s systems for locating information appear not to have functioned well in this case, as illustrated by the initial failure to identify relevant correspondence with a Member of Parliament. Wiping the hard disc of a departed senior member of staff, without first checking that it did not contain information which might not be available elsewhere, is a practice which might merit review. The Council may wish to consider if there are lessons it should learn from these matters. 21. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Chris Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 9th May 2012 9"

Signed [Signed on original] Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-EA/2011/0235; Decision IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL EA/2011/0235 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. This is an appeal by Mr. Stephen Forster (the “Appellant”), against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 22 September 2011. 2. The appeal arises from a request for information made by the Appellant to the Westminster City Council (“Council”) on 4 October 2010 for a list of motorcycle parking bays and the addresses where they can be located. The Request for Information 3. The request was made in the following terms: “I need a list of motorcycle parking bays (the addresses where they are located) so that I can plan trips into town. I found this site: http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/maps/fmn- form.cfm?maplayers=25 That search facility is no use to me. I need to see all the places where I can park and then I can plan my trip accordingly. The web page obviously requires a full list to function but that list has not be [sic] made available. Could you either supply the list to me or point me to the place where it is already available.” 4. Correspondence ensued between the Appellant and the Council, during the course of which the Council said that the information was exempt under section 21 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) on the basis that the information requested was accessible by other means. The Council provided a link to the Traffic Management Order (“TMO”) which contained about 100 pages of images of a list (in a pdf file), of the names of all the streets in the City of Westminster on which motorcycle bays are located. 5. The Appellant considered that his request had not been satisfied because the list he had been referred to was in a fixed form. The information it contained was not accessible because it did not allow him to search, re-order or edit the data in the list for his own purposes without having to type the data into another file. 6. Following an internal review, the Council informed the Appellant that it considered that section 21 had been applied correctly in respect of his request. The Council also considered the application of section 11 of FOIA. It noted that applicants have the right to request that information be provided in -3-EA/2011/0235; Decision a specific format, and that public authorities must accommodate any such preference where it is reasonable to do so. The Council said it had considered whether it was possible to provide the information requested in the form sought by the Appellant. However, given the number of pages and records that would require transcription, it considered that this would not be reasonable. The Complaint to the Commissioner 7. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner under section 50 of FOIA on the basis that the Council had failed to provide the information “in a format that was useful”. 8. The Commissioner investigated the complaint. He found that: <U+F0B7> the requested information was reasonably accessible to the Appellant and therefore, the Council had correctly applied section 21; and <U+F0B7> as the exemption in section 21 was engaged, there was no need for the Council to consider the Appellant’s request under section 11. The Appeal to the Tribunal 9. The Appellant has appealed to the Tribunal against the Decision Notice. 10. The Council was joined as a party, and at the Appellant’s request, the Tribunal held an oral hearing. The parties lodged an agreed bundle of documents and skeleton arguments. The Council also lodged a witness statement from Ben Goward, the Head of Information and Communication Technologies Service Delivery at the Council. For the avoidance of doubt, we should say that we have considered all documents submitted, even if not specifically referred to in this determination. 11. Prior to the hearing the Appellant and the Council requested more time in order to have discussions which it was hoped might lead to a withdrawal of the appeal. The time was granted but the discussions did not achieve the desired result, and the hearing proceeded as scheduled. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 12. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal from a Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other Notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 13. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, -4-EA/2011/0235; Decision as in this case, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. The Legislative Framework 14. Under section 1 of FOIA, any person who has made a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed if the public authority holds that information, and if it does, to be provided with that information. The duty on a public authority to provide the information requested does not arise if the information sought is exempt under Part II of FOIA. 15. Section 21 of FOIA which is the exemption relied on by the Council provides as follows (in so far as it is relevant): (1) Information which is reasonably accessible to the applicant otherwise than under section 1 is exempt information. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (a) information may be reasonably accessible to the applicant even though it is accessible only on payment, and (b) information is to be taken to be reasonably accessible to the applicant if it is information which the public authority or any other person is obliged by or under any enactment to communicate (otherwise than by making the information available for inspection) to members of the public on request, whether free of charge or on payment. ….. Issues 16. The only issue in this appeal is whether the information requested is exempt under section 21 of FOIA on the basis that it is reasonably accessible to the Appellant because he can access a list in pdf format containing the location of the parking bays. 17. There has been some confusion about whether and to what extent the Appellant relies on section 11 to assert that the Council must provide the information to him in such form as he has requested. His letter to the Commissioner dated 11 March 2011 suggested that he was relying on section 11. Subsequently, however, in his letter to the Commissioner on 17 March 2011, he said that he was not relying on section 11, and he has reiterated this in written submissions and orally at the hearing. We have accordingly not considered section 11 further. Findings 18. The Appellant has taken great pains to explain his position clearly and fully and we are grateful to him for doing so. By summarising his position only briefly, we do not intend to do a disservice to his full and clear arguments, but -5-EA/2011/0235; Decision for reasons we will explain, we find there has been a misapprehension on the Appellant’s part of certain matters that were only clarified by the Council when it served the witness statement of Mr Goward and further clarified in Mr Goward’s oral evidence at the hearing. The Appellant’s arguments have been largely superseded by the matters emerging from that evidence. 19. The Appellant accepts that the pdf list that forms part of the TMO contains details of all the motorcycle parking bays in Westminster, with addresses and locations for each. Although it does not contain the post code for the parking bays, the Appellant has said he is not seeking the post codes. 20. However, what he says he wants and what he believes the Council is obliged to provide to him, is the same list in a form that he can search, manipulate and re-order which he cannot do with a pdf file. He says that the information in the list in pdf form does not satisfy his request because in that form, the information is not reasonably accessible to him. In his view, the Commissioner has confused accessibility to a document which contains information, with accessibility to the information contained in a document. He says that even if one has access to a document which contains all the information requested, it is still possible that much of the information will not be reasonably accessible. This is particularly the case for lists, database dumps, spreadsheet data, etc. He says that the information he seeks is the myriad relationships which exist between the various data items. Those relationships and groupings are present in the data regardless of the presentation, but will not be readily apparent, and therefore not reasonably accessible to the user, if the data is presented in a fixed form. He points out that section 21 refers to the information (not the document containing the information) being “reasonably accessible”. 21. The Appellant’s arguments have been premised on the assumption that the Council holds the list in the form that he wants. He says that if they hold the information in the pdf format, they must hold the information in a character encoded form suitable for searching and collation. Indeed, he says that it is inconceivable that the Council does not have it. He says that such a list would have to have existed in order for the pdf list to have been produced, and that it is not plausible that the list would have been destroyed or that the Council would have to recreate the list if and when it needs to be updated. He also disputes the Council’s claim that to produce the list in the form that he wants would involve considerable effort. 22. However, it became apparent at the hearing that the Appellant’s assumptions do not hold true. The evidence of Mr Ben Goward, as set out in his Witness Statement and as further explained at the hearing, is that the Council’s information technology function is outsourced and that they only have a small internal team. That team deals with a large number of databases on myriad different functions and only rarely does it interact with the underlying database. He says in particular that the Council does not have a digital copy of the list that forms part of the TMO. He does not dispute that it must have existed, but he says that to his knowledge, and on the basis of inquiries he has made, the file no longer exists. It is vary rare for the Council to need to edit or alter the list so they would not need to have it for that purpose. He also -6-EA/2011/0235; Decision explained what effort would be needed to create the list in the form that the Appellant seeks. 23. While Mr Forster was critical, in his submissions, about certain aspects of the way in which the Council’s information technology systems are managed, he appeared to accept, in the end, after having had a full opportunity to cross examine Mr Goward, that the worst that can be said is that the Council does not manage aspects of its information technology function in a manner that the Appellant considers to be skilled, efficient or even sensible. He was clear that he was not challenging Mr Goward’s credibility, and in particular, he did not challenge Mr Goward’s evidence that the data is not held in the form that he seeks and that to produce the list would involve the effort that the Council claims that it would. The Appellant does not assert that the Council are required to manually transcribe the information in the pdf list to create for him a list in a searchable form. 24. Having heard Mr Goward, we too have no reason to doubt his credibility. While it may be that his internal inquiries could have been more extensive, we accept that genuine efforts were made to verify that the Council does not hold the list in question in any other form. We remind ourselves that the standard of proof applicable is the balance of probabilities. We accept, to that standard, that the Council does not hold the list in the form that the Appellant was seeking, and that producing it is not the simple matter that the Appellant had thought it must be. 25. For the reasons set out above, we consider that the Appellant’s appeal must fail. We would note that in any event, the Appellant now has the list in the form that he has been seeking. As a result of the discussions referred to in paragraph 11 above, the Council provided the Appellant with the information in the form of a spreadsheet. Mr Goward has explained in paragraphs 19 – 22 of his Witness Statement how the spreadsheet was produced and the time it took to produce it. The Council’s position remains that it was not required to produce it. 26. The Appellant confirmed at the hearing that the spreadsheet satisfies his request. It had not been provided until shortly before the hearing and therefore does not have bearing on the correctness of the Decision Notice. It is not a reason, therefore, to dismiss the appeal. However, the fact that the Appellant has the information he has been seeking has had some bearing on the brevity of this decision. It seems to us to be of little value to expound any points of principle in detail, bearing in mind that they would have little practical effect in this case, and no binding effect on future decisions of this Tribunal. 27. For completeness, we would mention that the Appellant indicated at the hearing that he wanted further information beyond what he had originally requested. In particular, he wanted the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for the individual barking bays. That was not part of his original request, however, and therefore, does not come within the scope of this appeal. -7-EA/2011/0235; Decision 28. The Appellant also indicated that he wanted to know whether the Council would provide a similar spreadsheet if and when it receives a similar request in the future. That, too, is not a matter within the scope of this appeal. Decision 29. For the reasons set out above, we dismiss this appeal. Our decision is unanimous.

Signed: Christopher Hughes Information Rights Judge Dated this 15th December 2011 REASONS FOR DECISION Preliminary issues 1. The Appellant in these cases originally indicated that he wished to have these matters considered on paper. On his account it was at a late stage that he realised that the Tribunal did sit outside London and he then applied for an oral hearing. The Tribunal granted such a hearing and the hearing was fixed for a date the Appellant had indicated was appropriate at a geographically appropriate court venue. The Respondents indicated that they would not attend the hearing. On 10 November the Appellant applied to the Principal Judge in the Information Rights jurisdiction for a transfer of the Appeal to the Upper Tribunal. He expressed a lack of confidence in the allocated judge and in the First-tier Tribunal in the light of the decisions of the -2-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 judge not to grant a number of orders he had sought. He indicated that the date and venue were inconvenient for his witnesses. 2. The Principal Judge did not order such transfer. The Appellant was invited to take part in a telephone directions hearing, however he did not acknowledge the e-mail invitation or telephone messages nor did he take part in the directions hearing. The directions hearing confirmed that the hearing would proceed and that the evidence of his witnesses would be accepted without the need for them to attend. The Appellant did not acknowledge receipt of the directions and was not available when telephoned by tribunal staff prior to or on the morning of the hearing. 3. The Tribunal considered, in the light of the over-riding objective, whether it should proceed with the hearing at the appointed date and time in the absence of the party who had requested the oral hearing. The Tribunal noted that its duty was to deal with the case fairly and justly in a way which was proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues, the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties. The Tribunal noted that there was no oral evidence, the documents available fully disclosed the cases of the parties, that three parties had indicated that they would not attend and the date of hearing had been acceptable to the Appellant and the location was objectively suitable for him, that he had been repeatedly notified that the hearing was proceeding, that the Appellant’s objection to the location and date were based on convenience for witnesses whose evidence (he had been informed) would be accepted in their absence. 4. The Tribunal was satisfied that the Appellant was aware of the hearing and had chosen not to attend or to co-operate with the Tribunal and acknowledge the communications from the Tribunal staff. The Tribunal considered that to adjourn would further delay the resolution of this case, and would involve a significant further expenditure of resources which could not be justified. The Tribunal accordingly decided that it would be fair and just to decide the case on the day appointed for the hearing. The Applications 5. On 16 March 2010 Mr Burns (the Appellant) made a request for information from the Lancashire County Council (the Second Respondent – the Council) for copies of what may be summarised as records and communications held by the Council with -3-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 respect to the drafting of a “consent form” for the disclosure of information. The Council rejected the request as vexatious on 16 April 2010 and waived the internal review stage, directing Mr Burns to the Information Commissioner in the event that he was dissatisfied. Mr Burns appealed to the Information Commissioner (the First Respondent) who on 16 February 2011 upheld the position of the Council. Mr Burns received the decision notice on 20 February 2011 and appealed to this Tribunal on 25 March 2011. 6. On 19 January 2010 Mr Burns wrote to the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service (the Third Respondent – the Fire Service) making requests for information concerning how it had dealt with documents he had wished to be circulated to the elected members responsible for the service and for “copies of all public expenditure/reimbursement records claimed by {name redacted} during the last 9 years of his elected appointments, or whatever the lesser maximum Treasury record retention requirements, for example, 7 years.” On 10 February 2010 the Fire Service declined to comply with the request on the grounds that it was vexatious. On 20 February 2010 Mr Burns requested an internal review, the outcome of which was the upholding of the refusal which was communicated to Mr Burns by letter dated 27 February 2010. On 28 September 2010 Mr Burns contacted the Information Commissioner who on 28 June 2011 issued a Decision Notice upholding the position of the public authority. Mr Burns received the decision on 2 July 2011 and appealed against it to this Tribunal on 21 July 2011. 7. In the light of the single underlying dispute and the reliance of both public authorities on S14 FOIA the Tribunal directed that these cases be consolidated. The factual background 8. The Appellant is one of a group of retired firefighters formerly employed in Lancashire and receiving pensions from the Fire Service. The Council provides a range of administrative services for the Fire Service. A review within that organisation prompted by the Audit Commission led it to conclude that there had been errors in the administration of pensions, notably concerning payments in respect of disabilities arising out of service and the interaction of such payments with benefits received from the DWP. The Service believed that in a number of cases -4-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 there had been overpayment since in its view the scheme rules did not permit the receipt of both the disability element of the pension and the relevant DWP benefit. It sought to confirm the DWP benefits received by various individuals in receipt of pensions from the Fire Service by seeking the information from various sources, including inviting pensioners to complete the “consent form” the drafting of which is the subject of one of the requests for information. A dispute arose between certain of the pensioners, among them Mr Burns, and the Service about whether there had been overpayment, the steps which the Service took to acquire information and the steps which the Service took to (in some cases) stop payments. There have been numerous contacts between the Service and Mr Burns about this dispute and the Service has issued has issued proceedings against Mr Burns for the recovery of money which it considers has been overpaid to him. Mr Burns has summarised his view of the dispute (see paragraphs 25 and 30). The challenged decisions and the position of the Respondents 9. The Council in refusing the request for information relied on S14 of FOIA and alleged that the application was vexatious. The ICO, in upholding that decision, conducted an investigation and analysed the case in accordance the methodology he has developed over a number of years in connection with cases where section 14(1) is applied by public bodies. This methodology draws on previous decisions of this Tribunal. In conducting his analysis the Commissioner considers each case in its context in the light of five questions and then takes a view of the matter as a whole. The five questions are:- <U+F0B7> Whether compliance would create a significant burden in terms of expense and distraction? <U+F0B7> Whether the request is designed to cause annoyance and disruption? <U+F0B7> Whether the request has the effect of harassing the public authority or its staff? <U+F0B7> Whether the request can otherwise fairly be characterised as obsessive or manifestly unreasonable? <U+F0B7> Does the request lack any serious purpose or value?” -5-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 10. The Council provided a schedule of 54 communications from Mr Burns to the Council with respect to the pensions issue between the start of 2008 and the request. Many of these were long and detailed (one was 54 pages long), and copied to multiple recipients inside and outside the Council. Mr Burns argued that he received answers to only 11 of these letters and the multiple copies were circulated to people in the Council who ought to be aware of the contents. The Commissioner noted that while only some of these related to FOIA and the Council could have been more active in responding to the correspondence, the request could not been seen in isolation from this correspondence and some weight should be given to the expense and distraction of dealing with the request. 11. The Commissioner in the light of the provocative tone of much of the correspondence, and of Mr Burns’ own statement that he is “engaged in uninhibited public criticism of the LCC and the Lancashire Combined Fire Authority” concluded that much of the correspondence was designed in part to cause annoyance. 12. Terms used by Mr Burns in correspondence accused individual recipients (usually Council officers although the correspondence was often copied to councillors and to persons outside the Council) of enjoying “humiliating and hurting”, of “abusing power”, “criminal and unlawful conduct”, “blatant falsehoods…calculated acts in which he blatantly lied”. Although the request itself did not contain such language the Council and Commissioner felt that in the wider context the request should be seen as harassing staff and a reasonable person would be likely to feel harassed or distressed by it. 13. The Commissioner concluded that Mr Burns was pursuing a campaign against the Council. He noted that he had made findings adverse to the Council in its handling of Mr Burns previously. He noted that in his dealings with the Commissioner, Mr Burns had misrepresented the position of the Commissioner to others and this was consistent with the statement of the Council that Mr Burns:- “has a history of “confirming” in writing the content of telephone conversations in a way that is twisted to suit his case” -6-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 He considered that such action was:- “not only manifestly unreasonable, but also casts doubt on whether the complainant’s accounts can be considered to be as objective as they may at first appear.” However in the light of his previous finding that the Council had not handled a request appropriately and his concerns as to the handling of Mr Burns’ personal data he did not find that Mr Burns was obsessive or manifestly unreasonable and gave no weight to this factor. 14. The Commissioner noted that the request related to the consent form for disclosure of data and Mr Burns’ argument that:- “this request goes to the legal heart of the matter. The key question being the illegality of the so called “consent forms”. … The primary objective of my exercise was to obtain independent documentary evidence that the LCC PS (Lancashire County Council Pension Service) in complicity with the LFRS (Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service) had acted unlawfully in stopping FSVs (fire service veterans) injury pension awards. My secondary objective was to support my charges against your LCC staff (and others) that they had acted in a (a) Knowingly criminal and reckless manner (b) in an unlawful manner; (c) and with defamatory words and imputations… you must now accept, on trust, that I have the independent documentary evidence I require to support my intended charges under (a), (b) and (c).” The Commissioner concluded that even if he accepted that the legality of the consent forms was central to the case concerning withdrawal of pensions, Mr Burns had stated that he had sufficient evidence to achieve that objective. The material was at best helpful; however in the light of the serious purpose behind Mr Burns request (the pensions dispute) on this point he gave modest weight in Mr Burns’ favour. 15. The Commissioner found that three of his five factors were engaged to some extent. He reviewed the context and noted the significance of the wider issue – the withdrawal of injury pension payments. He concluded:- -7-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 “(86)… while the complainant’s wider campaign has a serious and proper purpose, and the request should not be considered entirely in isolation from that undertaking, the request has not been shown to be sufficiently important to that wider campaign. He is therefore unable to give sufficient weight to the complainant’s statement that the request has a serious and proper purpose, in order to permit him to decide that that serious purpose outweighs the combined weight of the arguments put forward by the public authority. Accordingly, he finds that the public authority correctly applied section 14(1) of the Act in this case.” 16. The Commissioner followed a similar analysis with respect to the request for information from the Fire Service. 17. With respect to the burden, expense and distraction criterion the Commissioner noted a similar pattern of voluminous correspondence which was lengthy, poorly structured, copied to a number of recipients and with an expectation of a response where there was no formal request for information. The Commissioner considered that it would be inappropriate to distinguish between the requests and the wider correspondence because they formed part of the wider pattern; significantly he noted that any responses by the Fire Service “invariably provoke further correspondence in return.” He concluded that compliance would create a significant burden in terms of expense and distraction. 18. He similarly concluded that given the context and pattern of behaviour, some weight should be given to the criterion of the request being designed to cause disruption and annoyance. 19. The Fire Service argued that the volume, frequency, multiple copying and derogatory nature of the correspondence amounted to harassment of the authority and distressed its staff. The Commissioner noted:- “(33) In this case the Commissioner considers that the tone of the complainant’s correspondence containing the requests is characterised by attempts to discredit and make accusations against specific LFRS employees and members of the Combined Fire Authority. ….. (35) While it is not normally relevant to take into account an applicant’s motivation when making a request for information under the Act, the Commissioner considers that the complainant’s willingness to single out individual members of staff as the -8-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 focus of his requests and complaints means this factor is engaged. The nature of the complainant’s requests and other correspondence suggest that he has become more interested in pursuing campaigns against individual members of the Combined Fire Authority and LFRS employees than concentrating on the substantive points of his campaign about injury pension payment which he purports to be principally interested in. For these reasons, the Commissioner accepts that a reasonable person would be likely to feel harassed or distressed by the nature of the complainant’s dealings with LFRS and finds this factor is engaged.”. 20. The Commissioner noted that Mr Burns was pursuing a campaign against the Fire Service. He accepted that there was a thin line between obsession and persistence and concluded:- “(39) While the significant levels of correspondence exchanged between the parties since late 2007 began as part of the complainant’s determined and persistent pursuit of his campaign on the pensions dispute, more recently the focus of the campaign and the related correspondence has shifted to the complainant’s dissatisfaction with individuals within the authority. The Commissioner considers that the use of frequent and voluminous correspondence to pursue these secondary elements of the complainant’s campaign against LFRS mean the complainant’s behaviour and the request in this case have crossed the line from behaviour which is persistent to that which can be seen as obsessive. The Commissioner therefore considers that a strong degree of weight should be attributed to this factor.” 21. The Commissioner accepted that Mr Burns felt that his request had a serious purpose and in the absence of argument from the Fire Service did not attach weight to the criterion of an absence of serious purpose. The Fire Service submitted evidence to the effect that Mr Burns was attempting to shift the focus from the real issue, the pensions dispute, and that therefore the request lacked a serious purpose of value. 22. The Commissioner concluded that, having found four of the five factors engaged to some degree:- “He is satisfied that the requests in this case would impose a significant burden upon the resources of LFRS and would have the effect of disrupting the authority’s business and harassing or distressing the authority’s staff. The Commissioner also -9-Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 considers there is a strong indication that the persistence of the complainant’s campaign on the underlying matter of the pensions dispute has more recently developed into an obsessive and manifestly unreasonable campaign against the authority and individuals within the authority. For these reasons the Commissioner finds that LFRS correctly applied section 14(1) of the Act in this case.” Mr Burns’ Grounds of Appeal and Evidence 23. Mr Burns appealed against the Commissioner’s decision with respect to the Council on the basis of what he claimed was the Commissioner’s inconsistency in applying FOIA law and that the request was refused on the “grounds of the application of personality not law.” As supporting documents he referred to a large number of PDF files he had already supplied to the Commissioner. 24. The appeal document with respect to the Commissioner’s decision on the request to the Fire Service contained 13 grounds of appeal. Of these four were claims that the Information Commissioner had failed to apply FOIA correctly by not ascertaining whether the information sought was held; not applying a public interest test (twice) and failing in his duty with regard to S14(2) by not determining whether or not his request was actually repeated. These grounds were based on a failure to understand the law. Where a request is properly seen as vexatious then there is no duty to establish whether the information is held, no public interest test and in this case the argument did not rely on section 14(2). The other nine grounds were a failure to prove the request was vexatious, a “failure of duty of common humanity”; bias/failure to investigate properly; failure to consider the request in isolation; failure of impartiality; failure to approach this complaint with a clear mind; repeated failure to discharge his statutory duty; acting ultra vires in deciding that Mr Burns was “obsessive”; engaging in unbridled public character assassination. 25. Mr Burns stated that the core of the dispute was:- “The DN section described as “background” is incorrect in spite of my response to a request from the IC for information during which I supplied him with 165+ documents for him and his staff to consult. “Background paragraph 4 in particular is simply factually wrong, slanted and biased. - 10 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 If the IC must record a “background” then it behoves him to report it accurately, without bias or partiality, and in a balanced and objective manner and not as he has done working on behalf of the LFRS. An administrative issue, the core issue of this dispute, which he has failed to report on was repeatedly brought to the attention of the IC, a matter which ought to have interested him but did not. The question was why the LFRS had failed to recognise the impact of the implementation of the DPA on the statutory administration of the Fire Service pensions in respect of the DWP records. A matter which the IC is bound to investigate but in which he exhibited no interest whatsoever. The failure by both the IC and the LFRS led to the gross maladministration of the FSV’s DWP pension records which led in turn to the LFRS’s complete failure to maintain statutory pension records. This is why the LFRS refuses to release personal record files (PRF) to individual subject data Requests from disabled FSVs because it proves their case for maladministration. It is the IC’s duty to enquire into such a matter when brought to his attention yet he has failed to do so.” 26. In a footnote he stated:- “At the commencement of this dispute I developed a strategy to obtain information useful to the disabled FSV’s case. I repeatedly outlined a “step back procedure” which I would follow to the IC and those organisations involved in my attempts to gain information and personal data from four public agencies. Namely, the audit Commission, the DWP, the LCC and the LFRS” 27. In the course of his appeal statement he made criticisms of the relevant officer of the Commissioner in strikingly similar terms to those used about the officers of the Council and the Fire Service. 28. Mr Burns lodged a number of witness statements from retired fire fighters and the widow of a former fire fighter. These clearly show the strength of feeling these individuals have about the way that the Fire Service has handled the pensions issue and the significance of the underlying dispute relating to payments. One of the statements indicates that the witness had been advised by solicitors instructed by the Fire Brigades Union to sign a form authorising the Council to have access to his DWP records and had declined to do so. - 11 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 29. Each of these statements begins with a common form of words “I [name and address redacted] am a party to these proceedings, by reason that I am represented by Mr Paul P Burns the Appellant in this matter.”. This statement is inaccurate in that they were witnesses and not parties. 30. One of the earliest documents supplied by Mr Burns is a letter he wrote to the Commissioner in February 2008. It began:- “The issue is that the Lancashire County Council Pensions Services acting as contracted agents for the Combined Fire Authority/Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service threatens to suspend my Fire Service Injury Pension if I do not, under duress, sign away my legal right of data protection under the Data Protection Act 1998. I regard this proposal as unlawful and ultra vires.” The legal framework for the appeals 31. The role of the Tribunal laid down by s.58 FOIA is to determine whether or not the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice is in accordance with the law or whether the Commissioner ought to have exercised his discretion differently. To do so it can review any finding of fact upon which the Decision Notice was based. 32. In these cases the Council and the Fire Service have relied on section 14(1) FOIA arguing that the requests were vexatious and the Commissioner has agreed with them. A distinction should be drawn between this use of vexatious and a decision by the court that a litigant is vexatious. Following a complex process the decision that an individual is a vexatious litigant results in the individual being significantly restricted in her/his access to the courts. A decision that a request for information is vexatious has the considerably less significant result that the relevant public authority is not obliged to disclose the information. 33. Vexatious is not defined in the statute. The Commissioner has over the years, drawing on the decisions of this Tribunal, developed his guidelines as to how the - 12 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 question of vexatiousness may be approached. The guidelines have been endorsed by the Tribunal as a useful guide in Rigby v Information Commissioner and Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Trust EA/2009/0103. 34. Mr Burns argued that each request should be looked at in isolation; however to do so would be divorced from reality. The Tribunal stated in Gowers v Information Commissioner and LB Camden EA/2007/0114 that “it is not only the request itself that must be examined, but also its context and history. A request which, when taken in isolation, is quite benign, may show the vexatious quality only when viewed in context. That context may include other requests made by the applicant to that public authority (whether complied with or refused), the number and subject matter of the requests, as well as the history of other dealings between the applicant and the public authority. The effect a request will have may be determined as much, or indeed more, by that context as by the request itself.” The Tribunal is satisfied that in order to come to a just decision it is required to understand the significance of the request in its context and its impact both for the requester and the public body receiving the request. 35. The Tribunal considers that it is important to bear in mind that vexatious is an ordinary term in common use. Guidelines, however useful, should not become a straightjacket or lead to an over-formulaic approach to issues. The Oxford English Dictionary definitions of “vexatious” extend over several columns. A working summary of the definition however is “tending to cause trouble or harassment by unjustified interference.” Within this definition the issues raised by the Commissioner’s five criteria – the amount of work and expense caused to the public body, the impact of staff feeling harassed, whether done to annoy, whether obsessive or manifestly unreasonable, whether lacking in serious purpose - all fit easily. It is important to take all these issues into account as they arise, however any one of these may be of great importance and others may not figure at all. They need to be used flexibly and in the light of the context of the request. The Tribunal also notes that the term “obsessive” is unlikely to add significantly to the term “manifestly unreasonable” which can fairly be seen as encompassing the former meaning; which indeed is an expression very similar in meaning, in this context, to vexatious. - 13 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 Consideration of the Appeals 36. It is appropriate to take stock and review the case in the round. It is clear from the letter quoted at paragraph 30 above that Mr Burns’ concerns about data protection and FOIA arose from the threat to his income. He has pursued correspondence with the Council and the Fire Service on data protection and FOIA matters but the underlying issue driving this contact is an argument as to whether he and other retired firefighters have been overpaid. The Fire Service has issued proceedings against Mr Burns and the courts will decide whether or not there has been an overpayment; this, as the Commissioner clearly saw, will resolve the underlying issue. 37. Mr Burns has indicated that his strategy has been to “step-back” and seek information from relevant public agencies to acquire information for the purposes of the dispute. However it is difficult to see how the information he seeks is of significant assistance with respect to the financial issue, or even with respect to the broader emergent issue of data management by the public bodies which has been raised with the Information Commissioner in his data protection role on a number of occasions in respect of this issue. If indeed the Council and the Fire Service discussed the drafting of the consent form that would be unsurprising - the two public bodies had responsibilities to each other with respect to the administration of data concerning the retired firefighters. Furthermore Mr Burns has indicated that he already has the information and merely seeks to obtain this as confirmation. It is difficult to see how the request for disclosure of the expenses of the Chair of the Fire Service can contribute either to the underlying financial issue or to the emergent data management issue. The witness statements he has filed, while movingly demonstrating the distress which those individuals have experienced and their concerns about the actions of the public bodies do not materially advance Mr Burns cause, as the Commissioner repeatedly indicated, that is a significant and serious underlying issue; however the requests do not help resolve it. 38. In his appeal in relation to the Council Mr Burns asserted that the Commissioner had been inconsistent in the application of FOIA law and had applied personality not law. The Tribunal has not found any inconsistency or error in the application of the law nor any indication that the Commissioner has made a decision other than on the basis of a fair and impartial consideration of the relevant facts. - 14 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 39. In his appeal in relation to the Fire Service Mr Burns advanced four incorrect assertions with respect to the law which the Tribunal has dealt with above. The other nine grounds are similarly flawed. The Commissioner demonstrably carried out a proper investigation and his statutory duties in accordance with his powers, there was nothing inhumane in his actions or decision, there is no evidence of bias or lack of clear-sightedness, The Commissioner was correct to view the request in context, not in isolation, there was evidence upon which to find the request as vexatious and he considered the request obsessive not the requester. 40. In reviewing the appeals as a whole the Tribunal notes the enormous energy and persistence with which Mr Burns has pursued his struggle against the Council and the Fire Service. 41. There is no doubt that the underlying issue is one of great emotiveness and concern. The distress of those affected by the pensions review is clear to see from the witness statements placed before us and the accounts which we have read (if accurate), describing the treatment of those affected, quite understandably may give rise to feelings of injustice. However, perhaps the most significant difficulty for Mr Burns is this. While through all his excessively numerous, long and convoluted letters and arguments he may feel that he is advancing his cause, the detached and objective view, that of the reasonable and impartial observer with knowledge of the facts, is very different. It is clear these specific requests were but a stage in a long campaign. If they had been met they would simply have triggered further correspondence and requests (correspondence which, the Appellant insisted, should be sent to him by registered post). The whole process was imposing a significant burden on the Council and the Fire Service. While campaigns eliciting information from public bodies are of value and can make a contribution to accountability in a democratic society, and indeed the facilitation of such inquiries and campaigns is a key role of the Act, the way in which they are conducted is of significance to the Commissioner and the Tribunal. The tone of the correspondence and the multiple copying of personally abusive and offensive letters was on any objective assessment going to cause annoyance and disruption to these bodies and to harass and distress the staff. While public servants can be expected to show resilience in the face of abusive letters that does not mean that there is any entitlement on the part of the public to write such offensive letters to them nor to circulate them to others inside or outside the organisation. Under such circumstances the public authority should try to - 15 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 minimise the impact of such correspondence on individuals; perhaps by designating a single point of contact. The Commissioner was unsuccessful in eliciting a satisfactory account from Mr Burns of how these requests would advance his case. That is unsurprising. Neither of these requests is likely to be of value in the financial dispute or in demonstrating anything significant concerning inappropriateness in the public bodies’ handling of data and data protection issues (where indeed Mr Burns has indicated he already has the evidence). The seriousness of an underlying purpose is clearly relevant to the question of vexation – or being manifestly unreasonable or an unjustified interference; however it is an objective not a subjective issue. While Mr Burns may be entirely satisfied, the Tribunal is not. The issue is whether a reasonable observer would conclude that the purpose was serious and also whether the request was objectively likely to advance that purpose. The Tribunal unhesistantly concludes that no reasonable observer would themselves conclude that these were proper steps to the resolution of the problem. They are manifestly unreasonable. The requests were vexatious; they caused trouble and harassment by unjustified interference. 42. The Tribunal considered that while the Commissioner’s criteria had some value and undoubtedly had guided the Commissioner to the correct decision in these cases there were weaknesses in the criteria in that they over-valued the subjective views of the requester of information as to three of the five criteria – causing annoyance, harassment and serious purpose. It seemed to the Tribunal that the correct assessment of such criteria was on an objective standard – whether an impartial observer would conclude that the request was likely to cause annoyance, or harass staff or lacked a serious purpose. Clearly a finding that the intention of the requester was to cause annoyance or to harass would increase the weight to be attached to such a criterion; as would a finding that the request subjectively lacked a proper, serious purpose. Such an approach might simplify the investigation and assessment of such cases; it would have made no difference to the outcome of this case. The Tribunal noted that the Commissioner has amended his guidance away from a conditional test (i.e. whether the request would impose a significant burden and engage any of the four other criteria) to a test against any one of the five criteria. This is a helpful step. However, the Tribunal considered that the objective evaluation of the circumstances (as exacerbated by any subjective element) would seem desirable and the Commissioner may wish to consider revising his guidance further to reflect this. - 16 -Appeal No. EA/2011/0085-0158 43. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that both Decision Notices were correct in law and the Tribunal finds for the Respondents in respect of both appeals.

Name of Complainant: The Independent Police Support Group The Substituted Decision: 1. For the reasons set out in Confidential Annex 2, the substituted decision is that in relation to the first limb of the information request s31(3) is not engaged and the Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary has breached s1(1)(a) FOIA in failing to confirm or deny whether the information is held. 2. In relation to the second limb of the information request, the Tribunal is satisfied that s31(3) is engaged and that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information is held. Action Required: The Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary shall comply with s1(1)(a) FOIA in relation to the first limb of the information request within 35 days from today. Signed Fiona Henderson (Judge) Dated this 13th day of December 2011 3EA/2011/0114 REASONS FOR THE DECISION Introduction 1. The Professional Standards Department (PSD) of Hampshire Constabulary is responsible for investigating suspected misconduct in relation to its Police Staff and Officers. Executive Authority is an investigative tool whereby permission is granted by a Chief Officer1 for covert surveillance function2 to be introduced in cases of serious misconduct where the criminal threshold for directed surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) is not met. It is not provided for by way of a statute and unlike RIPA there is no statutory oversight. 2. Where during the course of an investigation authorised under Executive Authority procedure, criminal conduct by the subject(s) is identified, the Executive Authority must be immediately cancelled and an appropriate RIPA authorisation obtained. The availability of Executive Authority as an option for the PSD is outlined in the force’s procedure “Executive Authority concerning staff Issues”. This is available to all staff on the intranet. The Appellant considers that knowing that this investigative tool can be used is a significant deterrent to wrong doing amongst its employees. It is accepted by the Appellant that this is an intrusive tool. However, they argue that it can only be used in extreme cases where a subject is suspected of inappropriate activities. The Appellant’s Policy and Procedure for use of Executive Authority (paragraph 14) states that Executive Authority: “..applies to covert techniques conducted during the investigation of serious misconduct by police officers, and in circumstances outside of the workplace where such misconduct relates to a breach of Police Regulations 2003 (for example, restrictions on private life, incompatible business interest), or in relation to abuse of the Pension Regulations and attendance management procedures.” 1 The head of PSD or Assistant Chief Constable TO or SO 2 This includes the use of directed surveillance and/or deployment of a covert human intelligence source but will not be granted in relation to any activity taking place on residential premises or in a private vehicle other than the extent to which persons outside the curtilage of residential premises, or outside of a private vehicle would ordinary be able to view. 4EA/2011/0114 Request for Information 3. The Independent Police Support Group (IPSG) requested the following information (in the two limbs clearly specified) from the Appellant on 4th March 2010: “In the last 3 years, how many times has an ‘Executive Authority’ been authorised to conduct surveillance against police officers. Please provide details of the misconduct alleged and the outcome of each operation with regards to any sanction imposed.” 4. By letter dated 16th March 2010 the Appellant neither confirmed nor denied that it held the Requested Information relying upon the following FOIA exemptions: o section 40(5),3 o section 30(3), 4 o section 31(3) on the basis that complying with the duty to confirm or deny would, or would be likely to, prejudice the prevention or detection of crime and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders (section 31(1)(a) and (b)) and o section 44(2) FOIA 5 5. The IPSG applied for an internal review on 17th May 2010. The Appellant conducted an internal review the conclusions of which were dated 11th June 2010 which upheld this refusal notified to the Appellant on the same grounds. The Complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. The Appellant Complained to the Commissioner. In his Decision Notice FS50317117 dated 31st March 2011 the Commissioner: <U+F0B7> Held that none of the exemptions from the duty to confirm or deny were engaged; <U+F0B7> In relation to s31(1)(a) and (b) any information that might be held by the Appellant relevant to the request would not relate to criminal investigations; 3 Personal information 4 Investigations and proceedings conducted in relation to criminal matters by public authorities 5 Information covered by prohibitions on disclosure 5EA/2011/0114 <U+F0B7> Required the Appellant to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held. The Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant appealed dated 26th April 2011. In its grounds of Appeal (and clarified in its amended grounds of appeal dated 8th June 2011) the Appellant raised an additional exemption namely that the duty to confirm or deny was engaged pursuant to section 31(3) FOIA by reference to sections 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b) FOIA, because confirmation or denial would, or would be likely to, prejudice the exercise of its functions for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any improper conduct. 8. In an amended response dated 27 June 2011, the Commissioner accepted that, in light of the matters set out in the Appellant’s amended grounds of appeal: <U+F0B7> section 31(3) FOIA was engaged in this case by reference to sections 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b) FOIA. <U+F0B7> the Commissioner was satisfied that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information is held. 9. The Tribunal joined IPSG to this appeal on 10th June 2011. In their response dated 5th July 2011 they set out their grounds opposing the Appeal which can be summarized as arguments: a) Challenging that confirming or denying would be likely to cause prejudice and b) Arguing that the public interest lies in confirming or denying that the information is held. Legal Submissions and Analysis 10. Under the Freedom of information Act: 1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled – 6EA/2011/0114 (a) To be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request... 6) in this Act, the duty of a public authority to comply with subsection (1)(a) is referred to as the duty to confirm or deny. 11. The exemption to the duty to confirm or deny is found in s31 FOIA: (1)Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 306 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are— ... (b)the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, .... (3)The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1). 12. The Tribunal is satisfied that in respect of each limb of the information request it must determine: ii) Whether section 31(3) is engaged by reference to s 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b). iii) If so whether the public interest is in favour of Not Confirming or Denying that the information is held. 13. The Tribunal accepts the Commissioner’s submission that the “function” identified by 6 Investigations and proceedings conducted in relation to criminal matters by public authorities 7EA/2011/0114 a public authority for the purposes of section 31(1)(g) must be a function which is: (i) designed to fulfil one of the purposes specified in section 31(2) FOIA and, (ii) imposed by statute (or in the case of a government department, authorised by the Crown) and, (iii) specifically entrusted to the relevant public authority to fulfil (rather than just a general duty imposed on all public authorities). 14. The Tribunal accepts that the remit of the Professional Standards Department, (which is the department that would carry out surveillance under Executive Authority in cases where it is authorized), is responsible for investigating misdemeanours and misconduct alleged to have been committed by Officers and members of staff. The PSD’s remit is regulated within a statutory framework governed by the Police Reform Act 2002, and linked to the Police Act 1996 and the Police Conduct Regulations 2008. 15. The Tribunal is satisfied therefore that if information were held in relation to this request it would fall to be considered under s31. 16. The Appellant argues that confirming or denying whether the information is held would allow people to make deductions that would prejudice their ability to ascertain whether Officers and members of staff are responsible for any conduct which is improper. 17. They argue that confirming that the information is held would have the following effect: <U+F0B7> Allow those who have been investigated to know that Executive Authority may have been used against them. <U+F0B7> Allow individuals to adapt their behaviour to avoid detection. (Cross referencing the published disciplinary offences and the fact that it had been used might indicate the types of behaviour it was used to investigate). <U+F0B7> It risks alerting those who are currently subject to an ongoing investigation that they may be the subject of Executive Authority. 8EA/2011/0114 18. The IPSG argue that the exemption would not be engaged because: <U+F0B7> Officers and Staff are informed that they have been subject of an investigation and are served a discipline notice outlining the allegation, and their rights. <U+F0B7> The force publishes an internal newsletter regarding cases dealt with and the names of Officers disciplined. <U+F0B7> The fact that Executive Authority is a tool available to the PSD is known within the force as it is published on the intranet. 19. The Tribunal notes that confirmation of the fact of an investigation and the availability of an investigative tool, is not the same as confirmation that Executive Authority has been used. The information that an investigation has taken place (without disciplinary action being taken) is limited to the individuals concerned who have no duty to share that information, and circulation of the disciplinary list is limited to within the force, whereas disclosure under FOIA is to the World at Large. 20. The Tribunal accepts that confirmation that Executive Authority has been used might indicate to someone who knows that they have been investigated that it may have been used on them especially if they consider the seriousness of their misdemeanour when compared to the published list of those disciplined. However, since they would not know of others who had been investigated but not disciplined, confirmation that Executive Authority was used (even in a small Authority) would not provide unequivocal confirmation that it had been used in any particular case. 21. The Appellant argues that denying that the information is held would have the following effect: <U+F0B7> To provide unequivocal confirmation to those who have been doing wrong that they have NOT been subject to Executive Authority. <U+F0B7> This might embolden wrong doers and encourage potential wrong doers. <U+F0B7> Cross reference to the list of those disciplined, would allow staff and Officers to know the types of offence which have not attracted Executive Authority in the past and might encourage them to act in certain misconduct areas with relative impunity. 9EA/2011/0114 <U+F0B7> Reduce the efficacy of the deterrent effect by influencing the mindset of officers and staff minded to pursue “wrongdoings” based on the propensity of the force to use this law enforcement technique against its employees. 22. In relation to the first limb of the request, the Tribunal is not satisfied that s31(3) is engaged for the reasons set out in Confidential Schedule 27. 23. There is no dispute that in relation to the second limb of the request, confirming or denying that the information is held would indicate whether Executive Authority had in fact been used during the time specified. This is because of the terms of the request. It the Appellant holds information of the “outcome of the operation”, that can only be because there must have been an operation (which within the terms of the request would include the use of Executive Authority). In relation to limb 2 of the request the Tribunal is satisfied that s 31(3) FOIA is engaged because confirming or denying that the information is held would indicate whether Executive Authority had been used and the Tribunal is satisfied for the reasons set out above that this would prejudice the prevention and detection of misconduct. The public interest test in relation to limb 2 of the request 24. Section 31(3) FOIA is a qualified exemption and therefore subject to the public interest test as set out in s2(1)(b) FOIA: (1)Where any provision of Part II states that the duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to any information, the effect of the provision is that where... (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information, section 1(1)(a) does not apply. 7 This decision is accompanied by 2 confidential schedules. The first is disclosable to all the parties but is to remain confidential in all other respects and is not for promulgation. The second confidential schedule is not for disclosure to the public or the second respondent until after the Appellant has complied with the substituted decision notice. 10EA/2011/0114 26. In considering public interest factors applicable the Tribunal agrees with the approach set out in England & London Borough of Bexley v Information Commissioner EA/2006/0060 & 0066, at paragraph 65 which provides: (f) In considering public interest factors in favour of maintaining the exemption, they relate to the particular interest which the exemption is protecting..8. (g) The public interest factors in favour of disclosure are not so restricted and can take into account the general public interests in the promotion of transparency, accountability, public understanding and involvement in the democratic process. Factors favouring compliance with s1(1)(a) 27. The IPSG argues that: i. There is a need for informed public debate to further public understanding and involvement in the democratic process: <U+F0B7> It is argued that there is no clear legal basis for Executive Authority (unlike RIPA which is founded in statute), <U+F0B7> It does not appear that there was any consultation with Hampshire Police Authority (other than informing them that it was going to be implemented), ii. There is a lack of Transparency. The IPSG raise concerns that the procedure is being misused, it is supposed to be used only for serious misconduct falling short of criminal matters and only when this is the least intrusive or only way of obtaining the evidence. However, there is no way of knowing if: a) It is being used for minor misconduct cases, b) It is being used in conflict with the principle that it should only be used where evidence can be obtained through the least intrusive means. c) It is being used when criminal conduct is suspected and a RIPA authorization should be sought (e.g. whilst falsely claiming sick pay can constitute misconduct it can also constitute a criminal offence).9 8 In the Bexley case it was the prevention of crime 11EA/2011/0114 d) It is being used as a fishing expedition in cases where an investigation has failed to turn up evidence of wrongdoing. e) It is being used in a way that breaches Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. iii. There is a lack of Accountability <U+F0B7> The Authorising Officer for Executive Authority is the Head of PSD who is of Superintendent rank, <U+F0B7> The person authorizing the Executive Authority has no distance from the investigation as generally it authorized by the head of the investigating department, <U+F0B7> There is no statutory oversight or independent scrutiny or monitoring (unlike RIPA) with monitoring of the use of Executive Authority being conducted by the Authorising Officer. <U+F0B7> Subjects of Executive Authority have fewer avenues of complaint (e.g. their right to appeal to the IPCC is more limited than that of the general public). 28. The Tribunal notes that these are arguments largely in favour of disclosure of the substantive information requested (if it is held). It is not apparent that these public interests would be significantly advanced by the answer that information is or is not held. However, the Tribunal does consider this to be an argument relating to the public interest in transparency since the successful use of s31(3) FOIA stops an information request in its tracks and in the event that information is held, would prevent the consideration of the public interests in relation to the substantive information by the Tribunal. The public interest test requires the Tribunal to consider the public interest in all the circumstances of the case and the Tribunal is satisfied therefore that it is appropriate to consider the wider implications of complying with s1(1)(a). 9 The Tribunal notes that there is support for the IPSG’s argument on this point because the “wrong doings” that are said by the Appellant to be considered serious enough to investigate and consequently for which Executive Authority may be granted include a “criminal offence”. 12EA/2011/0114 29. Whilst the Tribunal accepts the principle that there is a need for informed public debate, the matters raised by the IPSG in this regard can all be argued from material already available and are unlikely to be significantly advanced by the information requested. 30. The Appellant (supported by the Commissioner) accepts that there is a public interest in transparency and accountability but argues that the weight of these factors is negated by virtue of the facts that there is some external supervision and monitoring. For example whilst surveillance other than RIPA does not fall within the Office of the Surveillance Commissioner’s (OSC) remit, they would look at what police forces around the country are doing regarding Executive Authority when visiting and inspecting forces. Additionally the Tribunal notes that the Appellant’s own procedure (02103) states that: 3.14.1Any staff member subject of covert surveillance activity authorised under Executive Authority may challenge its validity through application of the grievance procedure. In cases where the member of staff becomes the subject of misconduct proceedings, a right of challenge will exist under those proceedings. 3.14.2 Any person who considers that covert surveillance or interception of communications has been carried out, other than in accordance with the law, has a right of complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. Factors in favour of non compliance with s1(1)(a) 31. The Appellant repeats the matters set out in paragraphs 17 et seq which can be summarized as the argument that to confirm or deny would undermine ongoing investigations, reveal policing techniques, their level of use and risk identification of individual cases. It would either compromise the tactic or undermine its deterrent effect. Consistency they argue is in the public interest as it prevents inadvertent disclosure at a future date if a similar request is received at a later stage as inferences may be drawn from failing to state whether information is held in circumstances where s 1(1)(a) has previously been complied with. 13EA/2011/0114 32. The IPSG repeats its arguments as rehearsed at paragraph 18 above namely that the weight of these arguments is reduced by the information already disseminated within the force and to the subjects of investigation. 33. Upon consideration of all the material and arguments before it the Tribunal is satisfied that the balance of public interest lies in upholding the exemption to s1(1)(a) as set out in s31(3) FOIA. Conclusion and Remedy 34. The Tribunal is satisfied that in relation to the first limb of the information request s31(3) is not engaged and the Appellant has breached s1(1)(a) FOIA in failing to confirm or deny whether the information is held. In relation to the second limb of the information request, the Tribunal is satisfied that s31(3) is engaged and that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information is held.

"85","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2009/0108 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL/APPLICATION FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50252539 Dated: 27 May 2010 Appellant: Christopher Lamb Respondent: Information Commissioner On the papers Date of decision: 2 December 2010 Before Chris Ryan (Judge) and Gareth Jones Andrew Whetnall Subject matter: Prohibitions on disclosure s.44IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0108 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. We have concluded that the Information Commissioner was correct to conclude, in his Decision Notice dated 27 May 2010, that he had been entitled to refuse to disclose to the Appellant certain information that had come into existence in the course of an earlier investigation because, on a reading of section 44 of the Freedom of Information Act 2001 (“FOIA”) alongside section 59 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”), the information was the subject of an absolute exemption. Background Facts 2. In December 2006 the Appellant made a freedom of information request to the Cabinet Office for the Minutes of the Cabinet Meetings on 7th and 17th March 2003, at which the Government of the day made its decision to participate in the invasion of Iraq. The request was refused but both the Information Commissioner and this Tribunal (then called the Information Tribunal) decided that, although the information was covered by a qualified exemption under the Freedom of Information Act 2001 (“FOIA”), the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Accordingly the Cabinet Office was directed to disclose the information, subject only to the redaction of some minor elements of information. We will refer to this as the “Cabinet Minutes Case”.3. That direction was not complied with. The broad effect of FOIA section 53 is that such a direction ceases to have effect if the appropriate Cabinet Minister, issues a certificate stating that he or she has on reasonable ground formed the opinion that the public authority holding the requested information was not in breach of its disclosure obligation under FOIA section 1. Such a certificate (“the Ministerial Veto”) was issued by the then Secretary of State for Justice on 23 February 2009. 4. In accordance with FOIA section 53(3) a copy of the certificate recording the Ministerial Veto was laid before each House of Parliament. 5. No attempt was made to challenge the Ministerial Veto by an application for Judicial Review. The statutory process for dealing with the December 2006 request for information has therefore been exhausted. The Request for Information and its partial refusal 6. On 19 March 2009 the Appellant wrote to the Information Commissioner in the following terms: “Under the terms of the Freedom of Information 2000 I request disclosure of any copy of the minutes for the Cabinet meetings on 13 and 17 March 2003 held by the Information Commissioner’s Office with all background papers produced by ICO staff relating to, and pursuant to, its visit to the Cabinet Office on 19 September 2007 for the purpose of viewing the “withheld information” in situ. In particular, this request is targeted at background papers which show the processes of thought behind the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that the Cabinet minutes in question should be disclosed”7. The Information Commissioner is, of course, one of the public authorities listed in Schedule 1 of FOIA and therefore has the same obligation as any other public authority to disclose information to those requesting it under section 1. Of course he also has the same right to rely upon any of the exemptions set out in FOIA as a ground for refusing disclosure. But if his refusal is to be challenged, the challenge must take the form of a complaint under FOIA section 50 to the very same body that issued the refusal. That is what happened in the current case after the Information Commissioner, having disclosed some information from his file, refused to disclose the remainder. 8. The basis of the refusal was FOIA section 44, which provides that information is exempt information if its disclosure is “prohibited by or under any enactment”. In this case the Information Commissioner said that the relevant enactment having that effect was section 59 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The parts of that provision that are relevant to this appeal read: “(1) No person who is or has been the Commissioner…shall disclose any information which – (a) has been obtained by, or furnished to, the Commissioner under or for the purposes of [the information Acts], (b) … (c)… unless the disclosure is made with lawful authority. (2)For the purposes of subsection (1) a disclosure of information is made with lawful authority only if, and to the extent that- … (e) having regard to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of any person, the disclosure is necessary in the public interest.(3) Any person who knowingly or recklessly discloses information in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.” The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice 9. Some further information was released during the course of the Information Commissioner’s investigation. But his Decision Notice issued on 27 May 2010 at the conclusion of the investigation stated that he had been entitled to refuse to disclose the following three documents (“the Disputed Information”): (i) Handwritten notes made by Richard Thomas, the person holding office as Information Commissioner in September 2007, on the occasion that he visited the Cabinet Office to inspect the minutes that formed the subject matter of the Cabinet Minutes Case. (ii) Four bullet points of handwritten notes made by a case officer within the Information Commissioner’s office when discussing the case with Mr Thomas. (iii) A confidential annex which accompanied the Decision Notice in the Cabinet Minutes Case (and which, as a result of the Ministerial Veto, remains unpublished to this day). 10. The Information Commissioner has stated that he did not hold a copy of the minutes themselves at the time when the request was made. The Decision Notice recorded that item (i) above contained incomplete sentences, abbreviations and verbatim quotes from the minutes in Mr Thomas’, partially illegible, handwriting. Item (ii) was said to consist of one bullet point summarising briefly the scope of the minutes, with the remaining three recording the Information Commissioner’s arguments (but not the conclusions) on the question of disclosure. Item (iii) was said to consist of two parts, the first elaborating the analysis of the public interest test recorded in the open part of the Decision Notice andthe second setting out the information that the Information Commissioner considered should be redacted before release. 11. In his Decision Notice the Information Commissioner decided that the Disputed Information fell within DPA section 59(1) and that disclosure in response to the Appellant’s request would not have been with “lawful authority” under that subsection because the only applicable basis for arguing to the contrary would be section 59(2)(e) and, in all the circumstances of the case, it could not be said that the disclosure would have been “necessary in the public interest” having regard to “the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of any person”. The Appeal to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant filed an appeal from the Decision Notice on 11 June 2010. It was supported by detailed Grounds of Appeal. After a Response had been filed by the Information Commissioner directions were given for the determination of the Appeal in a paper determination, without a hearing, with each side having an opportunity to file written submissions and any evidence relied on. 13. The written materials filed with the Tribunal disclosed two issues for our determination. The first was whether the information in dispute fell within DPA section 59(1). The Information Commissioner complained that, as this had not been raised in the Grounds of Appeal but appeared for the first time in the Appellant’s written submissions, it ought not to be taken into account. However, we are satisfied that, as it was considered in the Decision Notice and the Information Commissioner had an opportunity of responding to it in his own written submissions, we should determine it. The second issue was whether, there was lawful authority for disclosure, with the result that disclosure would not have been prohibited under DPA section 59, so that the Information Commissioner was not entitled to rely on the exemption set out in FOIA section 44.14. We were not addressed on the question of whether the very existence of the Ministerial Veto would have justified a refusal to disclose any information that would have revealed any part of the Cabinet Minutes and we make no further comment on the point. 15. We will deal in turn with each of the issues identified in paragraph 13 above. Was the Disputed Information “obtained” from the Cabinet Office 16. In his written submissions the appellant challenged whether “in a strictly accurate sense” the information in dispute had been obtained by, or furnished to, the Information Commissioner since it was “the product and spin-off by-products of a ICO viewing of the Cabinet minutes in September 2007”. The Information Commissioner argued that if one considers the content of the three documents in question, and does not allow oneself to be led astray by their form, they clearly record information obtained from the Cabinet Office. We agree. In the case of document (i) the process of obtaining the information was direct, in that the Cabinet Office refused to provide a copy of the minutes themselves but permitted the Information Commissioner to inspect them and to take from them such information as he required, in the form of his contemporaneous note. In the case of documents (ii) and (iii) they each record parts of the same information, albeit that the connection with the originally inspected document is indirect. 17. We therefore conclude that it is correct to characterise the information in dispute as having been obtained by or furnished to the Information Commissioner so that it falls within DPA section 59(1). Would disclosure be prohibited under DPA section 59 as lacking “lawful authority”?18. Although a determination under section 59(2)(e) is based on a public interest test it is a very different test from the one commonly applied by the Information Commissioner and this Tribunal under FOIA section 2(2)(b), when deciding whether information should be disclosed by a public authority even though it is covered by a qualified exemption. The test there is that disclosure will be ordered unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Under section 59 the information is required to be kept secret (on pain of criminal sanctions) unless the disclosure is necessary in the public interest. There is therefore an assumption in favour of non-disclosure and we are required to be satisfied that a relatively high threshold has been achieved before ordering disclosure. 19. The appellant conceded in his written submission that the threshold he had to reach was indeed a high one. But he argued that disclosure would (or at least might) throw light on a number of factors surrounding the Cabinet meetings in question, which he considered to be of great importance. These included: a. The different accounts that had come to light as to what happened; b. The suggestion that the Cabinet might not have been well informed about, for example, a meeting between the Prime Minister of the day and the head of the UN body responsible for weapons inspection regime in Iraq; c. Criticism that had been voiced about the style of government at the time which, it was said, had sidelined the Cabinet to some degree and undermined collective Cabinet responsibility; d. A suggestion that the business to be conducted at one or both of the meetings had been “choreographed” by a few of those involved resulting in further undermining of the process of Cabinet government; e. Doubts expressed as to whether the role of the Attorney General had become confused in the period immediately before the meetings in question;f. Uncertainty as to how well the Cabinet had planned to meet its humanitarian responsibilities in the aftermath of the proposed invasion. 20. Each of these factors was explored in considerable detail in the Appellant’s written submission and was supported by a significant body of material extracted from the various inquiries relating to the Iraq conflict, which have either taken place or are currently in progress. However, on their own they cannot have any bearing on the matter. They may or may not create a case for disclosure of the minutes of the meetings in question. But that is a question that has already been disposed of, so far as concerns the original request that gave rise to the Cabinet Minutes Case, as a result of the Ministerial Veto. The Appellant appeared to concede as much by basing his argument in favour of disclosure, not on the public interest in seeing the relevant minutes, but in being provided with information to assess how the Information Commissioner obtained and processed information during the investigation he carried out at the time and how that process affected his determination. The issues and concerns summarised in the preceding paragraph serve, therefore, only to set the background against which the Information Commissioner’s actions must be assessed. 21. The Appellant’s argument misses the crucial point, which is that the Information Commissioner’s decision in the Cabinet Minutes Case was in favour of disclosure and that it was upheld on appeal. It is therefore very difficult to see any public interest at all in disclosing more information about the route by which he reached the very conclusion that the Appellant considers was the correct one. Nor can it be said, with any conviction, that the Appellant has a right or a legitimate interest in disclosure in those circumstances. It is no part of the freedom of information regime to provide a mechanism by which a party who prosecuted a successful complaint to the Information Commissioner in the past may have his or her winning marginreassessed in the light of events subsequent to the date of the original victory. 22. The Information Commissioner accepted that there was a public interest in his own procedures being transparent but argued that there were strong elements of public interest against disclosure, arising from the legitimate interests of the Cabinet Office and the public as a whole. First, so far as disclosure of the Disputed Information would reveal information which both the Information Commissioner and the Tribunal decided in the Cabinet Minutes Case should be redacted, there is clearly a particularly strong public interest in maintaining secrecy. Secondly, so far as disclosure would reveal the content of the minutes covered by the Cabinet Minutes Case, there is an equally strong public interest in the Ministerial Veto not being undermined and in the freedom of information regime not being used to reopen an issue that, in the absence of an application for judicial review at the time, was brought to an end by the publication of the Ministerial Veto in February 2009. Thirdly, disclosure would discourage future co-operation by public authorities in the Information Commissioner’s investigations. 23. The language of DPA section 59(2)(e) suggests that circumstances are capable of arising in which disclosure of materials provided to the Information Commissioner during an investigation would become necessary in the public interest. We need not speculate what those circumstances might be. It is sufficient for the purposes of this decision for us to say that they do not arise on the facts of this case. It is difficult to determine any public interest in disclosure, for the reasons we have given, let alone any of such magnitude that could be said to render disclosure “necessary”. And against that the public interest in maintaining confidentially is considerable. 24. We therefore conclude that the Information Commissioner would not have lawful authority to make the disclosure that the Appellant seeks and that to comply with the request in respect of the DisputedInformation in response to the information request would have been prohibited under DPA section 59(1). Accordingly the absolute exemption under FOIA section 44 applies and the Information Commissioner was right to conclude in his Decision Notice that he did not breach his obligations under FOIA section 1 when refusing to disclose the Disputed Information. 25. Our decision is unanimous. 26. An appeal against this decision may be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person seeking permission to appeal must make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of receipt of this decision. Such an application must identify the error or errors of law in the decision and state the result the party is seeking.

Signed: Chris Ryan Tribunal Judge 2 December 2010IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0108 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50252539 Dated: 9 February 2010 Appellant: CHRISTOPHER LAMB Respondent: THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Ruling on Application for Permission to Appeal. 1. On 2 December 2010 the Tribunal promulgated its decision on this Appeal (”the ICO Decision”) in which it concluded that the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice dated 27 May 2010, had been correct. He had concluded that, in his capacity as a public authority falling within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), he had been entitled to refuse to disclose to the Appellant certain information that had come into existence in the course of an earlier investigation. 2. The justification for refusal had been section 44 of the (“FOIA”), which provides that information is exempt information if its disclosure is “prohibited by or under any enactment”. The Information Commissioner had decided that the enactment that imposed that prohibition was section 59 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). It reads, in relevant part, as follows: “(1) No person who is or has been the Commissioner…shall disclose any information which – (a) has been obtained by, or furnished to, the Commissioner under or for the purposes of [the information Acts], (b) … (c)… unless the disclosure is made with lawful authority. (2)For the purposes of subsection (1) a disclosure of information is made with lawful authority only if, and to the extent that- …(e) having regard to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of any person, the disclosure is necessary in the public interest. (3) Any person who knowingly or recklessly discloses information in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.” 3. In the ICO Decision the Tribunal concluded that: a. The information in question fell within the scope of DPA section 59 as information obtained by him in the course of an investigation under FOIA. b. The effect of section 59 was to create an assumption in favour of non- disclosure, which would only be overridden if the public interest test set out in subsection 2(e) was satisfied. c. On the facts the public interest test was not satisfied. 4. The earlier investigation referred to in paragraph 1 concerned a request by the Appellant addressed to the Cabinet Office seeking disclosure of the minutes of the Cabinet Meetings in March 2003 at which a decision had been reached to invade Iraq. At the end of the investigation the Information Commissioner had ordered disclosure and, on appeal, the Tribunal (then called the Information Tribunal) had agreed with his conclusion. However, on 23 February 2009 the then Secretary of State for Justice had issued a ministerial veto under FOIA section 53 effectively overruling the Tribunal’s decision. This is referred to as “the Cabinet Minutes Case”. 5. On 19 March 2009 the Appellant approached the broad subject matter of the Cabinet Minutes Case by addressing a new information request to the Information Commissioner requesting disclosure of any copy of the minutes which he had retained from the earlier investigation together with “all background papers produced by ICO staff relating to, and pursuant to, its visit to the Cabinet Office on 19 September 2007 for the purpose of viewing the “withheld information” in situ.” This led, ultimately, to the ICO Decision summarised in paragraphs 1 - 3 above. 6. On 21 December 2010 the Appellant made a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal the ICO Decision. His written reasons for applying for permission to appeal did not challenge the parts of the decision summarised in 3 a. and 3 b. above but focussed entirely on whether it had been right to conclude that “having regard to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of any person”, disclosure had not been “necessary in the public interest”. 7. The right to appeal arises out of section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (“TCEA 2007”). That section provides that any party to adecision of a First Tier Tribunal has a right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal on any point of law but that the right may only be exercised with permission. Under rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (“the Rules”) permission to appeal must be sought from the relevant First-tier Tribunal. 8. The application for permission to appeal in this case satisfied the formal requirements set out in rule 42 of the Rules in respect of both its contents and the time limit for its submission. 9. Rule 43(1) requires the Tribunal, on receiving an application for permission to appeal that satisfies those requirements, to consider first whether to review the decision in accordance with Rule 44. That rule provides, in relevant part, as follows: “(1) The Tribunal may only undertake a review of a decision – (a) pursuant to rule 43(1)….; and (b) if it is satisfied that there was an error of law in the decision” 10. I am satisfied that there was no error of law in the Decision. In reaching that conclusion I have satisfied myself that: a. The procedures adopted by the Tribunal gave the parties adequate opportunity to present their evidence and arguments and included an opportunity to apply to vary the procedural directions if they thought that this was not the case. b. The Tribunal’s reasons for reaching its conclusion were adequately and intelligibly recorded in the Decision. c. There was no dispute between the parties as to the law which the Tribunal was required to apply, namely FOIA section 44, by reference to DPA section 59. d. The Tribunal interpreted the relevant provisions correctly, taking account of the submissions it had received from the parties. e. The facts relevant to the case were apparent from the materials presented to the Tribunal (including the circumstances in which the earlier appeal brought by the Appellant in the Cabinet Minutes Case had succeeded, but had been overridden by a ministerial veto under FOIA section 53) such that there was no error of law in reaching a conclusion that was not supported by evidence;11. I have also satisfied myself that the Tribunal’s application of the evidence to the law was rational and it was justified in concluding that the Information Commissioner would not have had lawful authority to disclose the withheld information, with the result that its disclosure was prohibited under DPA section 59. I reach that conclusion notwithstanding the assertion, in the Appellant’s written reasons for applying for permission to appeal, that the Tribunal had omitted a key argument in favour of disclosure. This was that the UK Government was “potentially in violation of the International Law and the Treaty of Obligations of the UN Charter” and that decisions had been taken that had not been “referred to Cabinet collective deliberation”. He sought support from criticisms of the Government’s legal justification of the Iraq invasion voiced by the late Lord Bingham and various witnesses to the Chilcott Enquiry and requested a re-assessment of the section 59 public interest test. He added: “My understanding is that pertinent to this test is whether the information involved could prove useful in the prevention or detection of an unlawful act. Other considerations such as whether the information could reveal dishonesty, malpractice, serious incompetence, seriously improper conduct or mismanagement on the part of executive decision-making should also enter into the test (as I understand it)” 12. The Tribunal took note, in paragraph 19 of the ICO Decision, of a number of public interest factors put forward by the Appellant in favour of disclosure. They included issues concerning the style of cabinet government at the relevant time and the suggestion that the role of the Attorney General had become confused during the period immediately prior to the decision to support the invasion. However, the Tribunal went on to say that those issues: “may or may not create a case for disclosure of the minutes of the [Cabinet] meetings in question. But that is a question that has already been disposed of, so far as concerns the original request that gave rise to the Cabinet Minutes Case, as a result of the Ministerial Veto. The Appellant appeared to concede as much by basing his argument in favour of disclosure, not on the public interest in seeing the relevant minutes, but in being provided with information to assess how the Information Commissioner obtained and processed information during the investigation he carried out at the time and how that process affected his determination.”13. I do not believe that the Tribunal committed any error in either identifying the relevant public interest in that way or in then concluding that it did not justify disclosure. The additional points raised in the reasons for applying for permission to appeal are closely related to those identified in the ICO Decision (if they were not then a question would arise as to whether they should be taken into consideration at all at this stage) and do not undermine the reasons the Tribunal gave for deciding that, viewed overall, the public interest test factors were in favour of refusing disclosure. 14. Because my decision not to review is based on my conclusion that there was no error of law in the Decision it follows that the Appellant does not have ground for appealing under section 11. Accordingly, pursuant to rule 43(2), I also refuse his application for leave to appeal. 15.

Signed Judge Dated this 9th day of November 2010 -2-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1 This case has its origins in a test carried out on a sample from Mr Edwards taken as part of the anti-doping regime in sport on 21st June 1997. The test was carried out at King’s College London. On 2 July 1997 the “A” sample was reported as having a greater proportion of testosterone to epitestosterone than is permitted. The “B” sample was tested in the presence of Mr Edward’s advisers on 18th September 1997 with similar result. A Drug Advisory Committee considered the case in 2000 and made a determination adverse to Mr Edwards. 2 Mr Edwards has been dissatisfied with this finding and has, over the years, contested the basis upon which it was made. There has been considerable correspondence between Mr Edwards and the various bodies concerned with sport; as well as with the then Minister of State for Sport and Mr Edwards’ MP. Some of this correspondence has been included in the bundle and provides background to this case. At some stage in 2003 or before Mr Edwards made a subject access request under the Data Protection Act for data which related to his sample. He was provided with what was considered to be personal data but calibration data was held not to be personal data and so not liable to be disclosed under the Data Protection Act. In a letter of 23 June 2003 from Kings College to the Director of Anti-Doping, UK Sport (a letter which forms part of a longer exchange of correspondence of which the Tribunal has not seen all items) which addresses various of these issues, the following text appears:- “Like the data pertaining to Mr Edwards’s samples that is also on fan paper. We could make the calibration data available to Mr Edwards, or his representative, to inspect at the Centre.” The request for information 3 On 13 March 2006 Mr Edwards made a request (citing the Freedom of Information Act (“the Act”) ) to King’s College London to supply him with:- “1 The calibration curves and calibration data for my test results dated 21/6/1997 ATN number 0100830 2 The contract for doping control/analysis of urine between UKS and DCC Kings College 13th March 3 The tender document supplied by UKS for doping control analysis from which the contract followed.” 4 Issues concerning the contract between UK Sport and the Drug Control Centre do not fall to be considered by this Tribunal and the sole matter with which we have been concerned is that contained in 3(1) which for convenience have been referred to as the “calibration data”. -3-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 5 On 3rd April 2006 King’s College declined to provide the information asserting that S38 of the Act allowed them to refuse to supply the information sought. At Mr Edwards’ request King’s College carried out an internal review; however this did not produce any change in the College’s stance. The complaint to the Information Commissioner (IC) 6 Mr Edwards complained to the IC on 10 July 2006 about the way the request had been handled. The IC initially treated this as a subject data access request under the Data Protection Act but concluded that the material under consideration did not constitute Mr Edward’s personal data. During the course of this process King’s College informed the IC on 5 May 2009: “I have [..] established that we did not run calibration data contemporaneously as part of the formal protocol for either the A-sample or the B-sample. This was not a requirement at the time. The data we do hold are the calibrations run closest to the samples under consideration.” 7 Having concluded the consideration of data protection issues the IC then considered this as a request falling within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act. On 12 November 2009 the IC wrote to King’s College identifying two issues in the investigation:- (a) Whether King’s College held the calibration data specified in the request, and (b) If so, what exemptions King’s College sought to rely on to withhold the information. 8 King’s College responded on 16 December 2009. They stated that they did not hold calibration data dated 21 June 1997, that it held such data for subsequent dates, that a file note of 14/10/99 indicated that it did not have contemporaneous calibration data but data from follow-up work prior to the “B” sample analysis, that it could not find any earlier calibration data, that it assumed that such data would have been routinely destroyed after 8 years according to the College’s usual practice, that it had operated its procedures in accordance with the relevant World Anti-Doping Agency procedures current at the time and that it did not consider that it held the data specified in the request. 9 The IC communicated this response to Mr Edwards and indicated a preliminary view that the data was not held. Mr Edwards confirmed that he remained of the view that the data was held, undertook to supply evidence to that effect and asked the IC to continue the investigation. Mr Edwards subsequently provided documents to the IC which did not lead the IC to change his stance. Mr Edwards asked the IC to come to a formal decision and on 5 May 2010 the IC issued a Decision Notice which found that, on a balance of probabilities, King’s College did not hold the calibration data for 21 June 1997. It further found that King’s College, in failing to notify Mr Edwards of this, had been in breach of S1(1)(a) and S10(1) of the Act. The IC also expressed concern at the approach that King’s College had taken to its handling of the request. -4-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS The appeal to the Tribunal 10 Mr Edwards appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights) (“FTT”) on 5 May 2010. 11 The key points raised in the appeal were:- a. The methodology of the assay required a contemporaneous calibration curve to be generated which can be directly related to the test results. b. It was clear to King’s College that the request was for the calibration data directly related to his test, such data was mandatory and the denial that King’s College held it was demonstrably false, the different reasons given by King’s College for non-disclosure where an indication of deliberate concealment. 12 The IC in his response noted that the issue of precise interpretation of whether the request was for calibration test data of 21 June 1997 or related to Mr Edwards sample of 21 June 1997 had been raised with Mr Edwards and he had affirmed that he wished to have disclosed calibration test data of 21 June 1997. It further noted that after initially misleading responses Kings College had consistently maintained that it did not hold calibration data of 21 June 1997 but held such data for July and September which was outside the scope of the request. Accordingly the IC was satisfied that King’s College did not hold the requested information. The law 13 The Tribunal’s jurisdiction in determining appeals is set out in S58 of FOIA. This provides “(1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers – (a) That the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) To the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 14 S. 1 FOIA provides in material part as follows: ""General right of access to information held by public authorities (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled – (a) To be informed in writing whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and -5-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS (b) If that is the case, to have that information communicated to him” 15 The Tribunal reminded itself that in order to be satisfied that particular information is not held, it is not necessary for the public authority to prove to a point of certainty that this is so, rather the matter is to be determined on the balance of probabilities (Linda Bromley v ICO & the Environment Agency EA/2006/0072). Thus, the Tribunal must ask itself is it more likely than not that the information is held. 16 In Berend v the IC and LB Richmond upon Thames (EA/2006/0049) it was held that the request for information should be read objectively. The request is applicant and motive blind and as such public authorities are not expected to go behind the phrasing of the request. Question for the Tribunal 17 In the light of the evidence available to it the Tribunal had to decide whether on the balance of probabilities King’s College holds the information specified at paragraph 3(1) above. Consideration of the evidence 18 Mr Edwards in his witness statement gave a history of his attempts to challenge findings that he had committed doping offences in 1994 and 1997. In 2003 he obtained some data which in his view cast doubt on the veracity of the King’s College results. He affirmed that contemporaneous validation data was required in 1997, asserted that King’s College thwarted his request for the data with a succession of excuses, made extensive reference to letters concerning his case over the years. 19 On the key claim made by King’s College that the data will have been destroyed he stated:- “It is an accepted fact that in disputed cases all data relevant to a drugs conviction will be held indefinitely. KCL have known since 1997 that I strongly disputed their work and rather than supply data to convince me or my advisers thay they were correct they have studiously avoided the issue, refuse to properly discuss anomalies in the data obtained in 2003 and absolutely avoided releasing calibration data which be capable of invalidating al their test results and thus exonerate me.” 20 A statement by Mr Eastwood (who has considerable experience of regulatory affairs in the pharmaceutical industry) was submitted by Mr Edwards as expert evidence:- “My comment is that validated assays at that time (1997) normally were run with standards…. It is unlikely that they omitted to run calibration for Paul Edwards’s test in 1997.” -6-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 21 Although Mr Edwards was given the opportunity to clarify and refine precisely what information he was seeking in his application he made clear to the IC by an e-mail of 31 January 2010 that he wished to proceed with the request which the IC had confirmed to him meant calibration data dated 21 June 1997. 22 The IC has identified various statements made by officers of King’s College over the years that the relevant procedures were correctly followed. In a letter of 9th September 2004 to UK Sport King’s College produced a detailed rebuttal to claims which had been made on behalf of Mr Edwards as to the conduct of the test; in particular confirming that “external samples” were processed at the time of the test; i.e. that the instrument was calibrated. That statement, together with the statement quoted in paragraph 2 above, clearly indicate the King’s College position that the tests were properly carried out. However while it could be inferred from these statements that such calibration data continued to exist, from the terms of the letters it is not clear on what specific date the calibration data was collected. King’s College, having relied inappropriately on S38 of the Act when they received Mr Edwards’ request for the calibration data in 2006, did not consider whether they actually held the specific information requested until a considerable time later. This was disclosed to the IC by an email dated 5 May 2009 and elaborated on in an e- mail of 16 December 2009 when King’s College disclosed to the IC an internal file note from 1999 that they do not hold contemporaneous calibration data for the first test but data from follow-up work prior to the B-sample analysis. Conclusion and remedy 23 Much of the material submitted to the Tribunal, while informative, does not bear on the question of whether calibration data for that date exists of not. In considering whether the information sought by Mr Edwards was held the tribunal has considered all the evidence available. . Mr Edwards has been unable to point to any unambiguous evidence that any calibration data as specified in his request ever existed. While he may feel aggrieved at how King’s College handled his request for the calibration data and this may have fuelled his suspicions; they are no more than that. 24 Although the Tribunal notes the assertions and expectations of Mr Edwards that all data relating to all his tests would be retained indefinitely he is unable to identify any specific applicable regulation from 1997 which would require it nor any procedural requirement that it be produced to the hearing in 2000 which made the determination in his case. 25 Nor has he been able to produce any evidence tending to show either that such calibration was not carried out, or that such a calibration was carried out and casts doubt on the reliability of the test on his sample. 26 Mr Edward’s case is that King’s College have dishonestly suppressed the calibration data. The finding of the Information Commissioner was that on the balance of probabilities while King’s College initially showed poor practice in handling this request there is no evidence of dishonesty and no evidence that the information is held. -7-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2010/0104 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 27 The Tribunal agrees with the IC. There is no evidence to suggest that there has been impropriety on the part of King’s College and no evidence to indicate that calibration data of 21 June 1997 exists. The evidence shows that the calibration data relevant to the test on Mr Edward’s “A” sample no longer exists. The Tribunal notes that King’s College have disclosed that it has held calibration data of 17 July and 16 September 1997. The Tribunal would not regard it as vexatious if Mr Edwards were to make a request for such information. 28 Our decision is unanimous. Permission to appeal 29 An appeal against this decision may be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person seeking permission to appeal must make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of receipt of this decision.

Mr Michael Cole (""the Appellant"") asked the Cumbria Constabulary (the ""Public Authority"") for the number of prosecutions for speeding offences on the M6 during 2007. He broke his request into a series of 5 mph speed bands ranging through from 70 mph to 90+ mph. 2. Initially Cumbria Constabulary refused to provide a breakdown of the numbers of prosecutions although it did provide a total figure. Subsequently it went on to provide the majority of the information but it declined to provide a breakdown of the two lowest speed thresholds, namely 70-75 mph and 76-80 mph. The Public Authority stated this was withheld under exemptions at Section 31 of the Freedom Information Act 2000 (""FOIA"") in relation to law enforcement and Section 38 in relation to health and safety. 3. Mr Cole's position in this appeal – which relates only to the section 31 FOIA exemption – is that releasing data in relation to prosecutions of the two bands between 70-75 mph and 76-80 mph would not encourage speeding because of existing publicity about the tolerance levels in relation to excess speed and actual prosecutions. The request for information 4. The Appellant wrote on 20 November 2008 to the Camera Safety Camera Unit based at the Public Authority’s police headquarters asking for information in relation to the M 6 motorway running through the Cumbria region and the number of prosecutions for speeding offences over the last 12 months (or the latest 12 months data are available) the speeds between: - 70-75 mph - 76-80 mph - 81-85 mph - 86-90 mph. -4-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No EA/2010/0071 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 5. The Public Authority responded and provided the Appellant with the total number of prosecutions but maintained that the further breakdown requested it would breach Sections 31 and 38 of FOIA. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner (""IC"") on 3 December 2008, challenging the Public Authority's decision to withhold the information requested. 7. During the course of the IC's investigation the Public Authority provided the majority of the information to the Appellant but it declined to provide a breakdown of the two lower speed thresholds (70-75 mph and 76-80 mph). 8. Further information was withheld under Section 12 FOIA relating to 570 records which included two kinds of information. The first concerned cases where it was not appropriate to make a Conditional Offer or issue an Endorsable Fixed Penalty Notice and the matter had been dealt with by way of summons. The second covered cases involving speeding offences detected by a police officer where an Endorsable Fixed Penalty Notice was issued to a driver at the time of the offence. 9. The IC served his decision notice on 23 March 2010 and concluded that Section 31 (the law enforcement exemption) was engaged and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure The appeal to the Tribunal 10. The Appellant appealed on the basis of that the IC's decision that Section 31 (a) and (b) FOIA applied was wrong. The questions for the Tribunal 11. The Tribunal had to consider the balance of the public interest in relation to the law enforcement exemption embodied in Section 31 FOIA. -5-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No EA/2010/0071 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Evidence 12. The Tribunal considered the full information in an un-redacted form – provided as Closed Information to the Tribunal – sought by the Appellant, but redacted in documents and letters provided to him. 13. Although that information was provided to the Tribunal to permit the detail and context of the issues under appeal it has not, as a matter of fact, played any part in the Tribunal's decision. Conclusion and remedy 14. The Appellant contests the IC's conclusion that if motorists were aware of precise speed thresholds, or the likelihood of being caught when travelling at a speed within the 70-80 mph speed band, that would give them the latitude to travel at what they perceive to be the highest speed at which they were likely to be able to evade detection. The Appellant submits that this argument ""is not substantiated and no evidence is provided to support it"". 15. The Appellant also argues that ""the fact that there is a declared policy and approach which allows +10% +2 mph, the 'tolerance level', over a prescribed limit is made by the police/public authority and known to the public defeats the argument that [disclosure of] further bands of data will undermine their ability to prosecute"". 16. Finally the Appellant argues that the IC was wrong to conclude that knowledge of the likelihood of being called within the lowest speeding threshold at 70-75 mph would be likely to impact on the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders when the tolerance level up to 79 mph (above the lowest speeding -6-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No EA/2010/0071 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS threshold) was already in the public domain. Those tolerance levels for speeding are contained within the speed enforcement guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (""ACPO""). 17. The Appellant argues that Section 31 FOIA does not apply to the prosecution or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the administration of justice ""as this section was not intended to be applied for information released of this nature in general is that it does not specifically relate to a case or individuals and by nature is past as any judicial process has been completed"". 18. The Tribunal disagrees with the Appellant. 19. The information requested does not have to relate to a specific case or a specific individual for the exemption to be engaged. The question (as correctly identified by the IC) is whether the information is likely to prejudice things like the prevention or detection of crime generally, not in relation to a particular individual. 20. The disclosure of the requested information would demonstrate a policy that would have continued to have been applied at the date of the request in November 2008 and is likely to have been prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime at this time. 21. It is established Tribunal practice that the date for the assessment of the issues before the Tribunal is the date of the original request. 22. It is also clear to the Tribunal that the ACPO guidelines are exactly that: guidelines and nothing more. Prosecutions can and do take place at the police's discretion on occasions that merit it when the speed limit has been breached only fractionally. -7-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No EA/2010/0071 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS 23. This is not the same as the kind of discretion used by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in terms of drivers and blood alcohol levels where the legal limit is 35 µg/mL but where prosecutions do not take place until the 40 µg/mL threshold is reached to ensure that any faulty tolerance levels within the equipment and machinery are not factored in adversely against drivers. 24. The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument that there is evidence to show that people ""do adapt their behaviour for better performance, e.g. smoking, eating etc when the facts and information is made known to them"". 25. It agrees with the IC's contention that simply because people adapt their behaviour in other parts of life when information is known it does not necessarily follow that this applies to driving habits. There is no evidence provided by the Appellant to support this assertion. 26. The Tribunal is satisfied to the required evidential standard (the balance of probabilities) that the disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime as it could encourage drivers to make judgements of the probabilities of enforcement at speeds within a certain margin above the speed limit. 27. Our decision is unanimous. 28. The Tribunal makes no order as to costs in relation to this appeal. 29. Under section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and the new rules of procedure an appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal on a point of law may be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person wishing to appeal must make a written application to the First – -8-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No EA/2010/0071 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS tier Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of receipt of this decision.

Robin Callender Smith Judge 29 August 2010 -9-Case no: EA/2010/0071 IN THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) RULING on an APPLICATION for PERMISSION to APPEAL By Robin Callender Smith Information Rights Judge 1. This is an application dated 15 September 2010 by Mr Michal J Cole for permission to appeal part of the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) (“FTT”) dated 31 August 2010. That decision dismissed the appeal of Mr Cole and upheld the Information Commissioner’s (IC) Decision Notice Decision Notice FS50225815 dated 23 March 2010. 2. The right to appeal against a decision of the FTT is restricted to those cases which raise a point of law. The FTT accepts that this is a valid application for permission to appeal under rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 as amended (“the Rules”). 3. The FTT has considered whether to review its decision under rule 43(1) of the Rules, taking into account the overriding objective in rule 2, and has decided not to review its decision because the grounds of the application do not raise an error of law for the reasons stated below. 4. The grounds of appeal rest on the basis that the FTT misinterpreted Section 31 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. <U+F0B7> Mr Cole asserts that the judgement wrongly interprets the release of the required information claiming it would cause the prevention of or detection of crime. <U+F0B7> He asserts that conclusion is wrong as the judgement suggests drivers would increase their speeds to the limit of ""unlikely prosecution"" if they knew the data of prosecutions at certain speed bands. <U+F0B7> Mr Cole states that the detection of crime (i.e. a speeding offence) is down to the law enforcement authority to choose the detection method and location etc. They also make the choice to prosecute or not if a driver exceeds the legal limit. <U+F0B7> He concludes that the driver has no influence on the detection or prosecution of crime. <U+F0B7> He states that there are further inconsistencies in the FTT’s decision because, at Paragraph 19, a similarly flawed argument as that set out above had been used. Also that at Paragraph 22 the circumstances of the guidelines did not change even if the data requested was released because the police discretion to prosecute remained absolute and still applied. At Paragraph 25 he states that the judgement argues against his view but that such an argument applied equally the other way and did not support the conclusion which was without evidence. <U+F0B7> Finally, at Paragraph 26, the use by the FTT of the Balance of Probability arguments was out of place as the ACPO guidelines already put 79 mph as a ""tolerance level""which was greater than the speed bands information requested. That guideline outweighed any arguments of driver behaviour adjustment at speeds below this level as this would encourage drivers to push their speed to this level if the argument used in the judgement was to be considered consistent. <U+F0B7> Mr Cole believed that the FTT’s decision had been unfairly applied to favour the IC with unbalanced allowance to the IC's argument and – incorrect logic – applied with a misinterpretation of Section 31. 5. The FTT reminded itself of the statutory wording of Section 31 of FOIA before arriving at its original decision and reviewed it, along with the original decision, in considering this request for an appeal to the Upper Tribunal. For the avoidance of doubt, the wording of that Section is set out below: 31 Law enforcement. (1)Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (a)the prevention or detection of crime, (b)the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, (c)the administration of justice, (d)the assessment or collection of any tax or duty or of any imposition of a similar nature, (e)the operation of the immigration controls, (f)the maintenance of security and good order in prisons or in other institutions where persons are lawfully detained, (g)the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (h)any civil proceedings which are brought by or on behalf of a public authority and arise out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment, or (i)any inquiry held under the M1Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiries (Scotland) Act 1976 to the extent that the inquiry arises out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment. (2)The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are— (a)the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, (b)the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, (c)the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise, (d)the purpose of ascertaining a person’s fitness or competence in relation to the management of bodies corporate or in relation to any profession or other activity which he is, or seeks to become, authorised to carry on, (e)the purpose of ascertaining the cause of an accident, 2(f)the purpose of protecting charities against misconduct or mismanagement (whether by trustees or other persons) in their administration, (g)the purpose of protecting the property of charities from loss or misapplication, (h)the purpose of recovering the property of charities, (i)the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare of persons at work, and (j)the purpose of protecting persons other than persons at work against risk to health or safety arising out of or in connection with the actions of persons at work. (3)The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1). 6. The Appellant's original appeal was on the basis that the IC's decision in respect of Section 31 (a) and (b) FOIA was wrong. The FTT considered the balance of the public interest in relation to the law enforcement exemption set out above. It also had the benefit of considering the full information sought by the Appellant, provided in an un-redacted form by Cumbria Constabulary, and noted that while the un-redacted information allowed the FTT to see the detail in the context of the issues under appeal, that information had not as a matter of fact played any part in the FTT’s final decision. 7. The Appellant takes issue with the fact (stated Paragraph 19 of the original decision) that the FTT concluded that the information requested did not have to relate to a specific case for specific individual for the Section 31 exemption to be engaged. The question – as correctly identified by the IC – was whether the information was likely to prejudice things like the prevention or detection of crime generally, not in relation to a particular individual. It further noted (at Paragraph 20) that the disclosure of the requested information would demonstrate a policy that would have continued to have been applied at the date of the request in November 2008 and would have been likely to have been prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime at that time. The FTT noted (at Paragraph 22) that it was clear that the ACPO guidelines were exactly that: guidelines and nothing more. Prosecutions could and did take place at the police's discretion on occasions that merited it when the speed limit was only breached fractionally. 8. The FTT notes that, in relation to the Appellant's complaint about its decision as expressed in Paragraph 25, no further evidence has been provided by the Appellant. For the avoidance of doubt the FTT stated: ""It [the FTT] agrees with the IC's contention that simply because people adapt their behaviour in other parts of life when information is known it does not necessarily follow that this applies to driving habits. There is no evidence provided by the Appellant to support this assertion."" 9. The Appellant complains that the FTT has incorrectly applied the balance of probabilities test in deciding that the disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime as it could encourage drivers to make judgements about probabilities of enforcement at speeds within a certain margin above the speed limit. 10. In essence the Appellant in this appeal against the FTT’s decision has done no more than say he disagrees with the conclusions but has provided no specific additional evidence or points of law to indicate the FTT made an error or arrived at an unsustainable conclusion. 311. It follows that the appeal has no prospect of success and that permission to appeal is refused. 12. Under rule 21(3) the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as amended Mr Cole has one month from the date this Ruling was sent to it to lodge the appeal with the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber).

The Tribunal allows Surrey Heath Borough Council’s initial grounds of appeal in the terms agreed at the directions hearing dated 16th April 2010 and orders that a redacted version of the originating letter be disclosed. 2. The Tribunal allows in part Mr McCullen’s appeal finding that: • The request should be considered under the EIRs. • Most of the disputed information was personal data (excepting the penultimate section), • Some small sections of personal data (as set out in the confidential schedules) should be withheld as disclosure would breach the first data protection principle. • The rest of the disputed information should therefore have been disclosed in redacted form. 3. The Tribunal refuses ground a(ii) of Mr McCullen’s appeal in that it does not find that, if the personal data belonged to Mr McInulty, he had consented to the disclosure at the relevant time. 4. Save insofar as the Tribunal has found that disclosure of some of the personal data would breach the first data protection principle, the Tribunal refuses the remainder of Surrey Heath Borough Council’s supplementary grounds of appeal and finds that: 2Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 • Regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs is not engaged, and that even if it were the public interest in withholding the disputed information is substantially outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. 5. Surrey Heath Borough Council are ordered to disclose a redacted version of the disputed information (as set out in the confidential schedules) within 28 days. 6. Confidential Schedule 1 to this Decision (which deals with personal data which the Tribunal does not order should be redacted) is to remain confidential until the redacted disputed information has been disclosed. 7. Confidential Schedule 2 to this Decision (which deals with personal data which the Tribunal orders should be redacted) is to remain confidential. 3Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated : 11th August 2010 Public authority: Surrey Heath Borough Council Address of Public Authority: Surrey Heath House, Knoll Road, Camberley, Surrey GU15 3HD Name of Complainant: Mr Kevin McCullen The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, and the closed schedules the substituted decision is that: 1. The Disputed Information within the originating letter amounts to personal data, the disclosure of which breach the first data protection principle, and is therefore exempt under regulation 13(1) EIR. 2. Disclosure of those parts of the personal data within the planning expert’s report (as set out in confidential schedule 2) would reach the first data protection principle, they are therefore exempt under regulation 13(1) EIR. 3. Regulation 13 EIR has been incorrectly applied to the remainder of the planning expert’s report. 4. In failing to disclose the redacted version of the planning expert’s report, Surrey Heath Borough Council failed to comply with its obligations under regulations 5(1) and 5(2) EIRs which require that environmental information shall be made available on request and no later than 20 working days after receipt of request. 4Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 Steps Required Within 28 days of the date of this substituted decision notice Surrey Heath Borough Council are ordered to disclose: • a redacted version of the planning expert’s report (redacted in accordance with confidential schedule 2), • a redacted copy of the originating letter (as attached to their original grounds of appeal). Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. Mr McCullen had complained to Surrey Heath Borough Council (SHBC) in relation to their decision to permit the felling of 200 trees within a property, additionally it appeared to Mr McCullen that in relation to the grant of planning permission a Council Planning Officer had been treated more favourably than an “ordinary” applicant. SHBC’s monitoring officer (Ms. Karen Whelan) produced a report dated 15th June 2007 into these and other concerns. Mr McCullen was not given a copy of the report but provided with a précis in a letter dated 15th June 2007 which included references and quotations from documents and advice received by SHBC. The request for information 2. On 12th July 2007 Mr McCullen requested a full copy of the report and a copy of the documents and advice that the report referred to from SHBC including: (6) “Copies of the full advice given by the two “experts” (an ex-local authority chief executive and planning officer and the expert in planning law) together with the originating letters from the council which brought about these responses. The date of these communications would be 2006-7”. 3. SHBC responded to the request and insofar as the items in (6) were concerned refused disclosure under section 42 FOIA: (1) Information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege ...could be maintained in legal proceedings is exempt information. 5Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 4. Mr McCullen challenged this refusal by letter dated 19th August 2007. In relation to item (6) he noted that SHBC had referred to “legal and professional privilege” instead of “legal professional privilege” which he argued sought to expand the ambit of that exemption. 5. SHBC conducted an internal review and communicated their response to Mr McCullen in a letter dated 16th November 2007. They upheld their original decision upon the same grounds and did not address Mr McCullen’s point that they had wrongly extended the range of professional opinion to which the exemption applied. 6. On 17th November 2007 Mr McCullen repeated his concern relating to the extension of legal professional privilege and the matter was again reviewed internally. On 19th December 2007 SHBC again upheld their reliance upon section 42 FOIA and also relied upon section 31(2)(b) FOIA (“the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper”). No public interest arguments in relation to these exemptions were given. 7. The matter was reviewed internally for a 3rd time on 19th December 20081 in relation to the originating letter to the planning advisor and his report. This review did not confirm the reliance upon 31(2)(b) FOIA but maintained reliance upon section 42 FOIA. Although reference was made to the public interest test, no public interest arguments were set out in support of their decision. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 8. Mr McCullen complained to the Commissioner on 4th September 2007. The case was allocated to a case officer in January 2009, when having viewed the disputed information, the Commissioner informed SHBC that the matter should be considered under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIRs) because the information related to “planning matters and activities which have a direct impact on the use of land and landscape” pursuant to regulation 2 EIRs. 9. Having agreed to reconsider the request under EIRs SHBC then failed to respond adequately to the Commissioner’s queries and the Commissioner issued an Information Notice (under section 51 FOIA) on 4th March 2009. 1 By this time Mr McCullen had already complained to the Commissioner and was waiting for his case to be allocated to a case officer for investigation. 6Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 10. When they responded, insofar as the items contained in (6) were concerned SHBC relied upon regulation 12(4)(e)2 and 12(5)(b)3 EIRs. Again no consideration of the public interest test was apparent from their response. During the course of the investigation Mr McCullen agreed to remove the instructions to Counsel and Counsel’s advice from his complaint in relation to item (6). 11. The Commissioner found several procedural breaches in the way that the request was handled but these are not the subject of this appeal and are not dealt with further. In relation to the exemption claimed under 12(4)(e) the Commissioner found that this was not engaged as the planning Consultant was not a Council staff member and constituted a 3rd party, as such communications were not “internal”. This finding is not challenged on appeal. 12. The Commissioner also found that section 12(5)(b) was not engaged in relation to the originating letter or the report. However, he did find that regulation 13 was engaged in that the contents of the report were the personal data of a third party and disclosure would be unfair (breaching the first data protection principle). 13. SHBC were ordered to disclose the originating letter within 35 days. The appeal to the Tribunal SHBC’s original appeal 14. SHBC appealed on 20th January 2010 on the grounds that part of the originating letter should not be disclosed because it constituted the personal data of the author of the report. SHBC attached a copy of the letter with their proposed redactions4. In his reply the Commissioner did not object to the proposed redactions. Mr McCullen was contacted upon the direction of the Tribunal and indicated that he did not object to the proposed redactions to the originating letter. 15. It was agreed at the telephone directions hearing that: 2 the request involves the disclosure of internal communications. 3 disclosure would adversely affect - the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; 4 The Tribunal has not seen an unredacted copy of the letter. The Tribunal has seen the context of the redactions and received the representations of SHBC as to their general contents in the grounds of appeal. In the knowledge that the Commissioner has seen the unredacted letter and in light of the agreement between the parties, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is no need for it to see a copy of the unredacted letter. 7Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 “SHBC’s grounds of appeal are to be allowed without consideration of the evidence by agreement between the parties” and that the substituted Decision Notice would follow the proposed form of words as set out at paragraph 19 of the Commissioner’s reply dated 16th February 2010 namely: a) The Disputed information amounts to personal data, the disclosure of which breach the first data protection principle and is therefore exempt under regulation 13(1) EIR. b) [SHBC] is required to disclose the originating letter with the Disputed Information redacted.” Mr McCullen’s appeal 16. In his response to the Tribunal indicating that he did not object to the proposed redaction, Mr McCullen indicated that he wished to apply for leave to appeal out of time on different grounds. Leave was granted dated 3rd March 2010 and on 5th March 2010 Mr McCullen appealed. In response to these grounds of appeal the Commissioner served a reply dated 31st March 2010. In this document the scope of the planning expert’s report was clarified as follows: “It is understood that the Disputed Information was commissioned by the Planning advisor to review planning applications linked to a number of complaints made by another member of the public (i.e. not Mr McCullen).” Mr McCullen has indicated that he believes this member of the public to be a Mr McInulty and has provided a letter from him indicating that he would in principle be content for disclosure of his personal data to Mr McCullen. In light of this, at the Directions hearing dated 16th April 2010 Mr McCullen’s grounds of appeal were clarified as follows: a) Whether disclosure of the personal data would breach the First Data Protection Principle in particular because: i) The personal data relating to the Planning Officer was already in the public domain, ii) If the information related to Mr McInulty he has consented to this disclosure, 8Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 b) In the event that the personal data did not belong to someone who had consented to its disclosure the document could be disclosed in redacted form to prevent the disclosure of the personal data. SHBC’s additional grounds of appeal 17. SHBC’s reply dated 11th May 2010 to Mr McCullen’s grounds raised the following additional issues to be determined by the Tribunal which the Tribunal ruled were additional grounds of appeal and leave was granted on 13th May 2010 for these issues to be considered out of time: i) Does the request fall under EIR or FOIA5? ii) Was the information personal data? iii) If so does it fall to be withheld under regulation 13 (if proceeding under the EIRs)6? iv) Does any other exemption apply e.g. regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs? Evidence 18. The Tribunal has considered all material before it and deals with the specifics within the analysis set out below and in the closed schedules. In coming to its decision, the Tribunal has viewed the withheld disputed material. The Tribunal considers that it is necessary to provide 2 separate closed schedules to this decision. Schedule 1 deals with information that the Tribunal orders should be disclosed. This schedule is to be promulgated once the information so ordered has been disclosed. Schedule 2 deals with information which is to remain confidential, Legal submissions and analysis Ground 1 Environmental Information Regulations 19. Regulation 2(4) EIRs defines environmental information as 5 The Tribunal issued directions on 12th May 2010 that only submissions under EIR should be submitted and in the event that the Tribunal found that FOIA applied they would invite further submissions. 6 The Tribunal considers this ground of appeal to encompass Mr McCullen’s grounds of appeal. 9Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 ""environmental information"" has the same meaning as in Article 2(1) of the Directive, namely any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on - (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; ... (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements; ... 20. The Tribunal is satisfied that the building or enlargement of buildings affects the land and landscape. Planning regulations are measures designed to protect the land and landscape. According to Ms Whelan (SHBC’s former monitoring officer) in her letter to Mr McCullen dated 15th June 2007 the disputed information is a “ look at these files to ascertain whether they had been handled professionally and appropriately”. As such it too is a measure designed to protect the land and landscape. The Tribunal is satisfied that the information is environmental information and falls to be considered under the EIRs. 21. Regulation 13 EIRs provides that: 13. - (1) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject and as respects which either the first or second condition below is satisfied, a public authority shall not disclose the personal data. (2) The first condition is - (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ""data"" in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, 10Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under these Regulations would contravene - (i) any of the data protection principles; ... and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under these Regulations would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. Ground 2 – is the information personal data 22. In order for section 13 EIR to be engaged, the withheld information must be personal data. It was agreed by all parties at the directions hearing that the disputed information did constitute personal data, however, this is now challenged by SHBC. In any event, the Tribunal is conscious that Mr McCullen made that concession without seeing the disputed information, and in light of this the Tribunal has been provided with a copy of the disputed information to enable it to determine this fact. 23. The definition of personal data is found in the DPA section 1(1): “personal data” means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller,... 24. Further clarification is provided in Durant v FSA [2003] EWCA Civ 1746 which can be summarized as: • Is the information biographical in a significant sense ? • Is the putative data subject the focus of the information? The Tribunal follows this approach. 11Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 25. In this case there is more than one putative data subject. Mr McCullen identifies a Planning Officer and the alleged complainant Mr McInulty as those whose personal data it is likely that the report contains. Since SHBC have disclosed that the report involved the review of planning files, it is self evident that the report may reference the personal data of those who have made planning applications. The Tribunal has considered whether the disputed information is the personal data of any individual and in an attempt to detail its approach has discussed the general principles that would be involved in the three perceived categories identified above. This should be treated as illustrative and not as confirmation of the contents of the disputed information which is dealt with in detail in the closed schedules. 26. In considering the personal data of any complainant, it is accepted that this report was prepared as a result of complaints to SHBC. In Durant Lord Justice Auld stated: “Just because the FSA's investigation of the matter emanated from a complaint by him does not, it seems to me, render information obtained or generated by that investigation, without more, his personal data.” The Tribunal is satisfied that if the complaint is merely the trigger for a freestanding review of planning decisions then the complainant would not be the focus of the report. If however, the review is not freestanding, in that the purpose of the report was to answer their concerns then it would be more likely that the complainant could be said to be the focus. This would be especially true if the report was an analysis of the complainant’s views, and concerns. 27. It is suggested by Mr McCullen that the report may also contain the personal data of Council officials. The Tribunal observes that mere passing reference to such individuals in connection with e.g. a particular planning application would not necessarily be personal data. The Tribunal would consider whether it was significant and biographical. For example in the judgment of this Tribunal, any suggestion that an individual was responsible for misconduct, had been investigated, or had been incompetent in some way (even if unproven) would have more biographical significance and would imply a greater focus upon an individual, than e.g. the name of someone performing an administrative function to whom no blame was alleged or attached. 12Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 28. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is likely that the naming of an individual who had lodged a planning application in a private capacity in the context of a report such as this would be personal data. It would provide their name, a private address, and could be linked back to issues relating to the value, and layout of their property 7 29. The Tribunal is satisfied that the majority of the report constitutes personal data. The question of redaction is dealt with at paragraph 43 below. Ground 3 30. The Tribunal now considers whether disclosure pursuant to the EIRs would breach any of the data protection principles. The first data protection principle as set out in Schedule 1 of the DPA, applies to personal data: 1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully 8and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, ... 31. The way in which the first principle should be interpreted is provided in Part II of Schedule 1: “(1) In determining for the purposes of the first principle whether personal data are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed.” 32. Mr McCullen believes that the report contains personal data which would be in the public domain by way of the planning process. SHBC and the Commissioner argue that just because documents connected with planning applications have been placed in the public domain, does not mean that the disputed information is therefore material which is already in the public domain. This is because the specific content of the disputed 7 Whether this information would already be in the public domain through the planning process or disclosable for some other reason is dealt with at paragraph 32 et seq below 8 Emphasis added by the Tribunal 13Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 information is not contained in the planning file and the disputed information did not form part of the planning process. 33. The Tribunal accepts that this report did not form part of the planning process (in that it was a review of existing files) but acknowledges that the personal data of an applicant e.g. name, address, size and layout of their property may already be in the public domain by way of the planning process. The Tribunal therefore considers whether there is any additional information which has been imparted that would not be in the public domain as a result of the planning process. If so the Tribunal would then consider the circumstances in which it was obtained. Additionally the Tribunal would consider whether the context in which the publicly available information appeared (e.g. if the fact that a complaint has been received about a particular planning application) meant that it would be unfair to disclose it. 34. SHBC argued that the 3rd parties may not have known about the existence of the disputed information and would therefore have reasonably expected the material to be kept confidential. The Tribunal takes into consideration the circumstances in which the information was obtained but observes that there can be no expectation of confidentiality for information released into the public domain for planning purposes. 35. The Tribunal contrasts SHBC’s concerns about the data of 3rd parties with their approach in their 19 page letter to Mr McCullen in which they responded to 12 allegations made by Mr McCullen. In this letter the properties which were the subject of his complaints were named, as were vendors, purchasers, and professionals who had dealings with the sales as were the Council officers involved. The letter made reference to the fact that legal and planning advice had been sought the implication being that it was in relation to these properties and persons. The letter was prefaced with the fact that some names and quotations were being withheld because of data protection concerns. The Tribunal will therefore take into consideration information that is already in the public domain when determining whether it is unfair to disclose the personal data within the report. 14Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 36. The Tribunal is satisfied it is not unfair to disclose some personal data within the disputed information, but that in relation to other personal data it would be. The details are set out in the confidential schedules. 37. When considering the “conditions” in Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998 Mr McCullen relies upon the first condition namely: The data subject has given his consent to the processing... if, as he believes, the complainant was Mr McInulty and the disputed information contains his personal data. 38. Mr McCullen has provided a letter from Mr McInulty dated 13th April 2010 stating: “I have no objection in principle to any personal data within the disputed document...being disclosed, assuming of course that it is my personal data in question”. The Commissioner notes that it is not clear from this what Mr McInulty means by “in principle” (Mr McInulty not having seen the disputed information at the time of writing the letter) and it is not clear whether he understands that this is disclosure to “the world at large” S v Information Commissioner and the General Register Office EA/2006/0030 and not just to Mr McCullen. The Tribunal has not sought clarification of these points because the letter was provided during the preparation of the case for appeal which was after the “relevant time”. 39. The Tribunal must consider the position around the time that the request was being considered by the Public Authority9. This is because the question for the Commissioner is whether SHBC dealt with the request in accordance with the EIRs. The information was requested in July 2007 and responded to and reviewed between August and December 2007. There was an additional review in December 2008 after the matter had already been referred to the Commissioner. Mr McInulty’s letter post dates all this consideration of the request and so it is clear that consent had not been given at the relevant time. The Tribunal is satisfied that in the event that the disputed information contains Mr McInulty’s personal data it should not be disclosed on this ground. 9 E.g. Guardian Newspapers Ltd and Heather Brooke v IC EA/2006/0011 and 13 15Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 40. Mr McCullen also relies upon Schedule 2 DPA 1998 Sec 6(1): “The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interest of the data subject.” 41. The Tribunal accepts that Mr McCullen and others have the following legitimate interests in assuring themselves that inter alia: • The planning process is being administered properly, • Planning policies are being applied fairly, • “Subsequent reporting” should be made public in the interest of maintaining confidence in the planning system, • Complaints are being dealt with appropriately. 42. In assessing these legitimate interests against the prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects, the Tribunal takes into consideration: • The level of additional prejudice that disclosure would bring in light of the information already in the public domain. • That there has been significant information already provided to Mr McCullen (in particular in relation to the 19 page letter from SHBC of 15th June 2007). • That considerable information is made available through the planning process. • There are additional levels of scrutiny of planning officials’ conduct e.g. the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) which can and had been exercised in this case. Redaction 43. Regulation 12 EIRs provides: (11) Nothing in these Regulations shall authorise a refusal to make available any environmental information contained in or otherwise held with other information which 16Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 is withheld by virtue of these Regulations unless it is not reasonably capable of being separated from the other information for the purpose of making available that information. 44. There is therefore a duty on SHBC and the Commissioner to consider whether any part of the information can be disclosed by way of redaction. The Commissioner now concedes that there is a section of the disputed information which can be divorced from the rest of the report and in which there is no personal data. The Tribunal agrees (for the reasons set out in confidential schedule 1). 45. The Tribunal goes on to consider whether the report can be redacted so that the personal data which is not disclosable pursuant to regulation 13 EIRs is not disclosed. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can be so redacted and gives details in confidential schedule 2 of the material that it finds should be redacted and the specific reasons for this. The Tribunal makes the following observations: • most if not all those whose details would be redacted would be able to identify themselves, in particular the complainant. • The Tribunal is satisfied that the unfairness or prejudice that it has identified (above) would arise from public dissemination of the fact that e.g. an allegation has been made or the probity of a planning application has been called into question. To the extent that others (e.g. the complainant) are able to determine who is being referred to the Tribunal is satisfied that: • There would be no additional prejudice in that they are already aware of e.g. the allegations, • There is a difference between someone being able to make an educated guess at an identity, and having it confirmed “officially” in a format which would enable wider dissemination. Ground 4 regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs 17Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 46. SHBC consider that regulation 12(5)(b) applies: 12. - (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if - (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. ... (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would 10adversely affect - ... (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; ... 47. The test for the Tribunal is whether disclosure “would” (not might or could) adversely affect the course of justice, etc. Would in the context of “would prejudice” has been held in Hogan and Oxford City Council v Information Commissioner EA 2005/0026 and EA/2005/0030 to mean “more probable than not”. This definition has previously been applied to “would adversely affect” in the context of regulation 12(5)(b)11 in other cases before this Tribunal (differently constituted), and this Tribunal adopts the same approach. 48. SHBC allege that the disputed information is legally privileged and that because of this its disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice. The Tribunal does not accept 10 Emphasis added 11 E.g. Burgess v IC & Stafford Borough Council EA/2006/91 18Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 SHBC’s case in relation to the purpose and status of this report. SHBC assert that the disputed information was compiled “at the ultimate request of Karen Whelan, a Solicitor employed by [SHBC], for the purpose of enabling her to advise her client [SHBC] in connection with the allegations made by [Mr McCullen].” From the evidence before the Commissioner this was a verbal request. 49. There is no evidence, beyond assertion, before the Tribunal that Ms Whelan was acting in her professional capacity as a Solicitor. It is not disputed that she is a qualified Solicitor, but in her letter of 15th June 2007 responding to Mr McCullen’s complaints she refers to: “my investigation as the Council’s Monitoring Officer” additionally she concludes the letter with: “Any further evidence which has arisen from commencing this investigation will be passed to the Council’s, New Monitoring Officer to consider”. 50. SHBC suggest that their evidence as to Ms Whelan’s status at the time of the request is “unchallenged”. The Tribunal notes that this assertion was not explored by the Commissioner in his Decision Notice who did not receive evidence as to Ms Whelan’s role and status at SHBC. It has however, been challenged comprehensively in this case by Mr McCullen. His case is that: • Ms Whelan was investigating his complaints in her role as Monitoring Officer not as a Council Solicitor. • SHBC’s constitution (Codes and Protocols) describes part of the Monitoring Officer’s function as to “make enquiries into allegations of misconduct...”. • The Monitoring Officer does not have to be a lawyer; • The current incumbent is not legally qualified. • It was therefore coincidental and not material to the commissioning of the advice that Ms Whelan was a Solicitor. SHBC submitted a reply to Mr McCullen’s arguments but did not address the Tribunal further on this point. This was an oral request and there is no witness statement from Ms 19Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 Whelan clarifying the situation. Neither was the Tribunal provided with a copy of the memo provided to the Commissioner which referenced the commissioning of this report. 51. SHBC submit that the disputed information is covered by the legal advice privilege “which attaches to the report prepared by Karen Whelan”: The Tribunal is not satisfied that legal advice privilege attaches to the report prepared by Karen Whelan. • The Tribunal repeats para 48 et seq above. • The Tribunal has not been supplied with a copy of the report (SHBC objected to Mr McCullen’s request to include it in the bundle on the grounds that it was not relevant). • Although the disclosability of the Karen Whelan report was not ultimately determined by the Commissioner12, when the matter was still at large before the Commissioner, SHBC did not assert that it was legally privileged and only relied upon regulation 13 EIRs to withhold the report. 52. The Commissioner was provided with more information than the Tribunal (he having viewed the Council’s report, the file note and the legal advice) and the Tribunal accepts the Commissioner’s account as set out in the Decision Notice that there was a minimal link between the disputed information and the report: • the report into staff conduct makes slight reference to the planning adviser’s response. • There is only one comment from the adviser’s response which is quoted in the report and this had already been disclosed by SHBC to the complainant. • The barrister herself did not seek the planning adviser’s report (although it may have been forwarded to her)13 . 53. SHBC assert that the purpose of the disputed information was to enable Ms Whelan to advise SHBC in connection with allegations made by Mr McCullen. It is publicly 12 It has been disclosed voluntarily pursuant to other legal proceedings and so the Commissioner was not asked to determine its disclosability. 13 It is not now suggested that privilege attaches because it may have been sent to the barrister who provided an opinion. 20Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 acknowledged that the planning report does not contain the personal data of Mr McCullen and cannot therefore detail his specific complaints. Whilst it may be that there is an overlap with the concerns of another individual, the Tribunal does not accept that it was created in order to advise SHBC in relation to Mr McCullen’s complaints. 54. SHBC allege that litigation privilege applies because Mr McCullen’s complaints amounted to negligence and/or criminal conduct on the part of SHBC’s officers and that this report was necessary for the purpose of criminal or civil litigation. SHBC further allege that the dominant purpose of the document was to identify failings by Council employees and then commence criminal or disciplinary proceedings if necessary. The Tribunal repeats its finding that the report was not commissioned to address Mr McCullen’s complaints. The Tribunal does not have an exact date for the disputed information but notes that by the 4th April 2004 it does not appear that Mr McCullen was alleging criminality in that Mr McCullen stated: “My view is now that this whole saga was not one of corruption; more one of an attempt to cover up a serious error of judgment”. The Tribunal is satisfied that this was before the commissioning of the disputed information. 55. Additionally having considered the disputed information the Tribunal is satisfied that there is no evidence that criminal or civil litigation was in fact then in contemplation. 56. Mr McCullen argues that any privilege that exists has been waived by its quotation in the letter of 15th June 2007, its circulation to Council members, an MP and its use in litigation. The Tribunal is satisfied that Council members and employees would constitute the client if a lawyer/client relationship existed and the disclosure to Mr McCullen is limited to 2 paragraphs of a longer report. The circumstances of its disclosure in litigation and to an MP are not before the Tribunal but this is clearly not wide distribution. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence before it that waiver applies on the facts of this case. 57. Regulation 12(5)(b) EIR covers more than legal professional privilege however, and SHBC allege that disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice more generally. They argue that this is an expert report and that they would be prejudiced in legal proceedings if it were disclosed. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence before it 21Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 that when the information request was being considered any trial or legal proceedings14 were in contemplation which would have been prejudiced by disclosure of this document. As noted above, Mr McCullen in 2004 was no longer alleging corruption and a Council officer had by 15th June 2007 already been subjected to disciplinary investigations by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) in relation to her personal affairs who had imposed the lowest sanction available. 58. SHBC argue that their experts would not be candid if they believed that their reports would be disclosed under EIR. The Tribunal has considered the stated purpose of the report, its method and its content and is satisfied that there is no evidence that it would adversely affect the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature. 59. In particular in relation to this limb of 12(5)(b) EIRs it was argued by SHBC that: “It may deter the expert from providing a view as a result of concerns about complaints by third parties (particularly those whose actions were under consideration) Indeed in this particular case, the second appellant has previously argued that Karen Whelan’s report is defamatory of him. This would, in this case, have therefore been a very real concern.” • The Tribunal notes that Mr McCullen is not the subject of this report. • Mr Mc Cullen could not be the subject of any criminal or disciplinary proceedings in relation to the propriety of the planning regime. • The Tribunal notes that this is a report being prepared by an expert. Experts are aware of numerous situations in which their confidential reports become circulated or public (not the least disclosure in legal proceedings). • There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the author of the report was told that it was being prepared in confidence or that it would not be provided to the complainant. 14 The Tribunal is aware that there is current litigation between Mr McCullen and SHBC but this is not so far as the Tribunal has been made aware the trial of any person. 22Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 • There is a difference between being candid and defamatory and it is not the function of the EIRs to enable information to be withheld just because it might be embarrassing to a public authority or an expert. 60. The Tribunal also notes the level of detail provided in the response of 15th June 2007 to Mr McCullen (and the Tribunal would expect that a similar level of information would go to the complainant in this case15) in support of its conclusion that there is no evidence that the prospect of disclosure would affect the quality of the advice obtained. 61. In support of the argument that disclosure of the disputed information would prejudice criminal or disciplinary proceedings it is argued that: • “it might alert third parties to arguments that they had not considered or to weaknesses/strengths in their own arguments that they may not have considered.” The Tribunal observes that this is more applicable to assessing the strength of a planning challenge and is not realistically material to criminal or disciplinary proceedings. • “It would also put the party concerned on notice of steps that were to (or may) be taken.” Again the Tribunal notes the contents and remit of the report and does not consider this argument relevant. 62. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the exemption is not engaged. In light of the paucity of the evidence surrounding the circumstances in which the report was commissioned, the Tribunal nevertheless goes on to consider the public interest test. 63. The Tribunal reminds itself that under the EIRs there is a presumption in favour of disclosure. 15 The Tribunal has not been provided with any information dealing with any response given to the complainant and whether there is any overlap with information supplied to him and the contents of this report. 23Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 64. The Tribunal is also satisfied that the following factors support disclosure in the public interest: i) Transparency and accountability in the planning process. It is in the public interest that planning law and SHBC’s planning policies are applied fairly and appropriately and that the public are reassured that this is the case. Whilst the planning process itself is open, Ms. Whelan acknowledged in the letter of 15th June 2007 that: “Because of the nature of the allegations regarding planning issues to do with [a Council Officer’s] private property and the Oaks Nursery, any investigation undertaken by officers of the Council would be unable to satisfy the perception of the public as being fair and impartial. As a consequence the planning issues were examined by two different consultants. The first being an ex-local authority Chief Executive and Chief Planning Officer...” SHBC having relied upon the fact of an independent review there is a public interest in the public knowing the exact remit of the review, how thorough it was and what it covered. If there is greater transparency about decisions taken by public authorities it is likely that this will promote accountability. It also impacts upon the quality of decisions if more information about the way that decisions are reached is disclosed. ii) It is in the public interest to clarify any misapprehensions derived from incomplete disclosure. From the letter of 15th June 2007 Mr McCullen was left with the impression that the planning expert had conducted the review in response to his specific complaints. It is now in the public domain that the planning review was in response to someone else’s complaints and it is Mr McCullen’s case that the expert was not directed to his specific allegations. Additionally the way that the excerpts from the 2 expert reports are quoted in the letter to Mr McCullen of 15th June 2007 appears to attribute quotations from the legal advice to the Planning Expert16. iii) Disclosure of the disputed information would provide an additional layer of public scrutiny and inform debate as to SHBC’s application of their planning policy, 16 At page 18 of 19 24Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 thoroughness of their complaints procedure and the efficacy of their policies where an officer encounters a professional/private conflict. iv) The Tribunal is also satisfied that it is in the public interest that information is available that allows individuals to understand decisions made by public authorities affecting their lives (in this case the planning decisions themselves and the reasoning behind the failure to uphold the complaints), and to assist them to challenge those decisions if applicable. 65. In favour of withholding the information i) Experts would not be as candid if they believed that their reports would be disclosed under EIR. ii) Expert’s would be deterred from providing a view as a result of concerns about complaints by third parties (those whose actions were under consideration and the complainant). iii) Public authorities would be disadvantaged by the absence of a level playing field in that it might alert third parties to arguments that they had not considered or to weaknesses/strengths in their own arguments that they may not have considered. (The Tribunal observes that this is only relevant in terms of any potential litigation. Conversely the same information assists the public to challenge planning decisions or informs their approach when making planning applications). iv) It would put the party concerned on notice of steps that were to (or may) be taken. v) In the event that the Tribunal is wrong and legal professional privilege does apply the Tribunal accepts that there is a strong inherent weight attached to the preservation of such privilege17 vi) It is in the public interest that decisions taken by local authorities are taken in a fully informed legal context where relevant. vii) The advice needs to be comprehensive and point out the counterarguments. If this were not the case the quality of an Authority’s decision making would be reduced because it would not be fully informed. 17 DBERR v O’Brien EWHC 164 25Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 viii) A public authority might be reluctant to seek advice or to record verbal advice which could lead to unnecessary expenditure and poor decision making. 66. In determining how much weight to give these factors, the Tribunal has considered the stated purpose, content and methods employed in compiling the disputed information. The Tribunal also takes into consideration how much information there was already in the public domain. Whilst SHBC would argue that this reduces the need for the report to be disclosed, the Tribunal is satisfied that the publication of the remit and conclusions of the planning report in the context of the detailed letter of 15th June 2007 reduces the strength of the argument that an expert would expect his report to remain confidential. 67. The Tribunal is not persuaded that a public authority would avoid seeking legal advice or not record it. Public authorities are at risk of challenge and criticism if they fail to take advice when appropriate or do not keep adequate records. 68. The Tribunal has not been told of any “live” civil or criminal or disciplinary proceedings pending at the relevant time to which this report was material. However, the Tribunal does not consider that the disputed information was stale in that that information request was made 4 weeks after Mr McCullen received his response to his complaints in which this disputed information was briefly quoted. 69. For the reasons set out above and amplified in the confidential schedule, the Tribunal is satisfied that the public interest lies strongly in favour of disclosure (subject to the redaction of some personal data pursuant to regulation 13 EIR for the reasons set out at para 30 et seq above and in confidential schedule 2). Other Matters 70. SHBC raised the issue of the applicability of EIRs in their additional grounds of appeal as follows: “There would appear to be an issue as to whether or not the data falls within the EIR. If as asserted, the focus of the disputed information is the conduct of the chief planning officer (rather than, for example, the state of elements of the environment or measures affecting those elements) this is not, in our view, a matter that falls within Regulation 2 of EIR”. 26Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 71. The Tribunal observes that having raised the issue of the applicability of EIRs SHBC were inconsistent in their approach and did not assist the Tribunal upon this point during the preparation of the appeal, in this respect their approach was not in keeping with the overriding objective in particular regulation 2(4)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First- tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 : • SHBC have the advantage of having seen the disputed information and it is not helpful for speculative arguments to be raised based upon the assumption of a litigant in person who has not seen the disputed information. • No argument was advanced in the grounds of appeal or the submissions as to why an investigation of the conduct of a planning officer in their professional capacity is not capable of being a measure affecting land or landscape. • Having raised the issue of EIRs in their grounds of appeal, SHBC did not make any representations in their written submissions to the Tribunal upon this point. • In light of the Commissioner’s indication that it was his view that the EIRs applied, SHBC made submissions to the Commissioner indicating which EIR exemptions were relied upon, • The Commissioner did not uphold these EIR exemptions in relation to other linked documents that are not before the Tribunal, and ordered disclosure, • SHBC accepted the application of the EIRs and the Commissioner’s ruling as to the inapplicability of exemptions in relation to those documents. It has disclosed those documents. Conclusion and remedy 72. For the reasons set out above and in the closed schedules the Tribunal finds that: b) The request should be considered under the EIRs. c) Most of the disputed information was personal data (excepting the penultimate section), d) Some sections of personal data (as set out in the confidential schedules) should be withheld as disclosure would breach the first data protection principle. e) The rest of the disputed information should therefore have been disclosed in redacted form pursuant to regulation 12(1) EIRs. 27Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 f) If the personal data belonged to Mr McInulty, he had not consented to the disclosure at the relevant time. g) Regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs is not engaged. h) Even if it were the public interest in withholding the disputed information is substantially outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. 73. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Fiona Henderson Tribunal Judge Dated this 11th day of August 2010 28Appeal No. EA/2010/0034 IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 Information Commissioner’s Ref: FS50176219 Heard on the papers at Holborn Bars, London, EC1N 2NP Decision Promulgated On 1st June 2010 11 August 2010 BEFORE Fiona Henderson And Ivan Wilson And Jacqueline Blake BETWEEN: SURREY HEATH BOROUGH COUNCIL 1st Appellant and MR KEVIN McCULLEN 2nd Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Reasons for Decision Closed Schedule 1 1Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 Introduction 1. These reasons refer to the specific content of the disputed information (but do not make reference to material that the Tribunal considers should be redacted) and are designed to be read in conjunction with the open decision and follow the same headings. They are ordered to remain confidential until after disclosure of the redacted disputed information after which they may be promulgated and disclosed to Mr McCullen. Ground 1 Environmental Information Regulations 2. The disputed information specifically states; “My remit is to look at the applications associated with [2 named sites] and to see if the files demonstrate that the planning issues and approach is fair, reasonable and appropriate given my experience of working in planning... I was also requested to review applications submitted by Jane Baldwin and her husband on their property in relation to the complaints made or implied in his email of 24.10.05” On its face the disputed information is clearly a measure designed to protect the land and landscape. The Tribunal is satisfied that the information is environmental information and falls to be considered under the EIRs. Ground 2 – is the information personal data 3. The Tribunal has compiled a table (see below) which sets out the material that it considers to be personal data that should not be redacted and the reason. 4. The Commissioner concedes that the section entitled: “Application files and Records” concerns the Council’s management of files and records relating to planning applications. Disclosure of this section would not reveal any personal data and could be disclosed without contravening the first data protection principle. The Tribunal agrees with this assessment. There is a reference to “head of built environment has suggested that staff adopt a formal attitude to such correspondence...” The Tribunal is satisfied that an individual can be identified from this through his role. He is expressing an opinion in a professional capacity and judgment is being passed as to whether that is the correct approach. The Tribunal is satisfied that as the report is not critical of him 2Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 and the fact that staff had been told to take this approach is likely to be evident from the way that they handle the public, disclosure would not breach the first data protection principle. 5. The person whose complaints are considered in the disputed information is named. The Tribunal is satisfied that all the information save the penultimate section headed application files and records is his personal data because: <U+F0B7> The report is entitled “COMPLAINTS – PLANNING SERVICE <U+F0B7> The stated purpose of the review is: “I have been asked to review the planning applications associated with persistent complaints submitted by [the complainant] to officers and members of [SHBC]”. <U+F0B7> It provides an assessment of the nature of the complaints, <U+F0B7> It sets out details of the complaints to the Chief Executive, <U+F0B7> The report references the allegation in each section, and is tied directly to the scope of the complaints. The complainant is clearly the focus of the report, in that it is being compiled in order to respond to him. It is also biographical in that it details complaints he has made, his views and and actions he has taken. 6. Jane Baldwin and her husband are also both identifiable. The Tribunal is satisfied that this is also personal data in that the propriety (or otherwise) of her planning application is in issue. She is the focus of this section of the report which is headed “Assistant chief planner Baldwin” and her husband becomes so by association. 7. The report makes references to those who had conduct of the planning application and the Tribunal considers that the same arguments would apply by extrapolation to any other professionals acting in their professional capacity. Although not named they are identifiable through the planning file which is in the public domain. The Tribunal is satisfied that this is not personal data where it is not biographical ( i.e.their role is limited, administrative and not criticized) neither are they the focus of this part of the report. If however, their conduct is being judged in some way (even if it is ultimately approved) the Tribunal is satisfied that it is personal data. 3Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 8. The author of the report is not named in the draft that the Tribunal has, however Mr McCullen appears to have identified him and as such the author would appear to fall within section 1(1) of the DPA. Although he is not the focus of the report in that it is not about him, he does express his views and opinions within the report which is about his conclusions having undertaken the review of the files. As such the Tribunal is satisfied that it contains his personal data. Ground 3 - whether disclosure pursuant to the EIRs would breach any of the data protection principles. 9. Jane Baldwin’s planning application is made in her married name, although she works under her maiden name. This might be the type of additional information which the Tribunal considered unfair to disclose in this context if it provided more information than the planning process. However, the Tribunal notes that the email of 16th August 2008 is in the public domain. This is headed “Jane Baldwin’s planning application” and deals with a clerical error in the stamped signature upon a letter. It appears in the public planning file relating to her application. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the link between the “married” details of Jane Baldwin and her “professional” details is already in the public domain. 10. SHBC argue that Jane Baldwin was not aware of this report and that the disclosure of the analysis of a complaint about her would be unfair. The Tribunal notes that: <U+F0B7> Jane Baldwin is publicly accountable, <U+F0B7> The letter of 15th June 2007 is in the public domain and provides a very detailed response to Mr McCullen’s allegations. In particular it quotes the conclusions of this report insofar as they relate to Ms Baldwin in this context. <U+F0B7> This report exonerates her. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that there was no expectation of confidentiality at the relevant time (which was after the letter of 15th June 2007) in relation to the public consideration of complaints relating to any conflict between her employment and her planning application. 4Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 11. It is not apparent from the evidence before the Tribunal that the complainant’s complaints are fully in the public domain through the planning process or otherwise. References are made to representations from certain members of the public in the planning files that we have been provided with but they are not named. The planning files that are the subject of these complaints are not all before the Tribunal. There is no geographical nexus to the complaints (i.e. because of their location he could not be the next door neighbour to all of them) and cannot be identified that way. 12. The Tribunal does not consider that it is personal data to identify that the complainant was male. The size of the population is sufficient in this context that this will not identify the complainant. 13. The name of the applicants and their professional advisors relating to The Plant Centre and White Cottage Farm will all be identifiable by following the trail back to the planning file. This information is therefore already in the public domain. The “fresh” element is that a complaint has been made and the planning application reviewed. The Tribunal is satisfied that this additional level of information is not sufficient to make disclosure unfair. Any person making a planning application would expect that the merits of the application would be analyzed by the Council. There is no offer or guarantee of confidentiality relating to this; the planning process being public. Whilst this is not a part of the planning process in that a report such as this is not required under planning law, it is an exercise that could have been undertaken publicly during that process and the Tribunal is satisfied that disclosure in this context would not be unfair. 14. Mr McCullen also relies upon Schedule 2 DPA 1998 Sec 6(1) including his legitimate interest that his complaints are being dealt with appropriately. Mr McCullen asserts that he believed from the letter of 15th June 2007 that all his concerns had been reviewed by this planning expert, and apart from any overlap that there may be with this complainant’s complaints it is apparent that none of his concerns were directly considered in this report. The Tribunal has not been provided with the actual complaints made by the Complainant, but there is no evidence that what Mr McCullen asserts was his specific concern in relation to his “allegation 12” was ever considered in this report namely that “the chief Planner 5Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 [name] had misrepresented the planning history of the property in question to a planning committee in order to gain favourable planning consent for a colleague”. 15. Additionally from the letter of 15th June 2007 it states that: Allegation 10 – Jane Baldwin tried to purchase the Oaks Nursery at a reduced price (Notwithstanding the various professional views the Council has now received that [name] was acting as a professional and experience planner in adopting her approach to change of use)... 16. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the disputed information considered this allegation or formed any conclusions on this point. The Tribunal notes from the letter of 15th June 2007 that in the context of Allegation 11: “ that [name] tried to coerce the owner into submitting a “change of use” application, when a colleague had already determined that the classification was appropriate.” Reference was made to: “Brian Townley [Head of Built Environment] has previously had no involvement with this case in the past and was asked to look at these files to ascertain whether they had been handled professionally and appropriately. In essence he is satisfied that the advice given and the questions asked regarding the change of use enquiries were professionally handled.(p15 of 19)”. However, the Tribunal is satisfied that the letter of 15th June 2007 in the context of later reference to the disputed information and the quotation from it could give the misleading impression that this report had considered this allegation. Ground 4 regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs 17. SHBC allege that litigation privilege applies because Mr McCullen’s complaints amounted to negligence and/or criminal conduct on the part of SHBC’s officers and that this report was necessary for the purpose of criminal or civil litigation. SHBC further allege that the 6Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 dominant purpose of the document was to identify failings by Council employees and then commence criminal or disciplinary proceedings if necessary. 18. In relation to complaint (a) – the allegation is that the landscape and garden centre on this site is unauthorised and despite complaining and raising the issue with the chief executive it still remains unauthorised after 3 years. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the analysis of the files in this context is relevant in a disciplinary context. Whilst the report finds that there is a staff backlog, the report does not seek to determine where the fault lies or to attribute blame. As such the Tribunal is satisfied that the focus is not disciplinary but upon the complaint. 19. In relation to complaint (c) there is criticism inherent within the complaint of Council employees who are alleged to have got their decision wrong. However, there is no individual attribution of action. The reference is to “officers” who inspected the site, “building control staff” and “officers” who recommended conditional consent. Whilst discussion is had with “the Building Control Officer” this is in the context of obtaining a “professional opinion” and not by way of challenging or scrutinizing his actions. Again the Tribunal is not satisfied that the purpose or intended use of this part of the report was disciplinary. The public interest test 20. The Tribunal is also satisfied that the following factors support disclosure in the public interest: 21. Transparency and accountability in the planning process. It is in the public interest that planning law and the Council’s planning policies are applied fairly and appropriately and that the public are reassured that this is the case. Whilst the planning process itself is open, Ms Whelan acknowledged in the letter of 15th June 2007 that: “Because of the nature of the allegations regarding planning issues to do with [a Council Officer’s] private property and the Oaks Nursery, any investigation undertaken by officers of the Council would be unable to satisfy the perception of the public as being fair and impartial. As a consequence the planning issues were 7Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 examined by two different consultants. The first being an ex-local authority Chief Executive and Chief Planning Officer...” As the Tribunal has already noted, there is no evidence that the disputed information dealt with the “Oaks Nursery” which is adjacent to Jane Baldwin’s property but not the subject of either of the applications reviewed in the disputed information. 22. The Tribunal is also satisfied that it is in the public interest that information is available that allows individuals to understand decisions made by public authorities affecting their lives (in this case the planning decisions themselves and the reasoning behind the failure to uphold the complaints), and to assist them to challenge those decisions if applicable. The Tribunal is satisfied that in relation to White Cottage Farm, the response would allow the complainant and the wider public to understand the decision made. In relation to the Plant Centre: “some of the activities on this site are unauthorised at this point of time” and that “Most of the detailed work on examining application SU 05/206 is complete but it is part of the backlog of cases which staff are trying to clear”. is relevant in assisting the public to achieve a decision, or challenge a decision and participate in the planning process and highlighting the inefficiencies and problems then current within the planning department. 23. In favour of withholding the information i) Public authorities would be disadvantaged by the absence of a level playing field in that it might alert third parties to arguments that they had not considered or to weaknesses/strengths in their own arguments that they may not have considered. It is accepted that in relation to White Cottage farm the report concludes that some of the activities are unauthorised, but in the context of an outstanding planning application and the tone of the report it is not the Tribunal’s view that it is suggested that this is a serious problem. 24. In determining how much weight to give these factors, the Tribunal notes that apart from discussions with the Building Control Officer the report constitutes an administrative review 8Appeal Number: EA/2010/0034 of the publicly available planning files. This is not a case where witnesses might be less frank or evidence might disappear and as such the Tribunal is satisfied that “the chilling effect” has less relevance in that the conclusions are likely to be those that any expert (including one employed by the public) could come to. 25.

The Tribunal finds that the Information Commissioner (IC) was wrong in law in upholding the Nottingham City Council’s (the Council) Refusal Notice because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct and that the Decision Notice cannot stand. 1Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 The Tribunal substitutes a new Decision Notice requiring the disclosure of the following documents to Dr Peter Bowbrick (Dr Bowbrick) within 14 days of the date of this decision, namely a. from the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence following the December Hearing minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” also dated 22 July 2003; b. from the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence on 3 August 2006: i. an undated document of objection from a parent as redacted in disclosure to the Tribunal at pages 188 to 192 of the bundle; ii. a letter of objection from a Councillor dated 3 July 2003 at page 193 of the bundle; iii. a letter of objection from Ellis Guildford School and Sports College dated 16 July 2003 at page 194 of the bundle. B. The Tribunal further finds that: c. the Council failed to confirm within 20 working days of Dr. Bowbrick’s request that it held information falling within the scope of his request. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(a) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s. 10; d. the Council failed to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick within 20 working days of his request the information that it held that fell within the scope of his request and that was not subject to any exemption under the Act. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(b) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s.10. e. the Council failed to identify within 20 working days of the request the exemptions upon which it relied in respect of certain documents falling within the scope of Dr. Bowbrick’s request. It thereby failed to comply within its duty under s.17(1) of FOIA within the time limit prescribed by that section. C. The Tribunal further orders that Nottingham City Council shall pay the whole of Dr Bowbrick’s costs as taxed as a litigant in person. 2Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 D. In addition, because of the unsatisfactory way that the disclosures have taken place, the Tribunal recommends that the Information Commissioner uses his powers under s.48 FOIA to make a practice recommendation to Nottingham City Council specifying steps which in the Commissioner’s opinion the Council should take in order for it to conform with the codes of practice under ss.45 and 46 of FOIA. In relation to this recommendation we are mindful of the fact that Dr Bowbrick has made further requests of the Council and the Tribunal is anxious that these requests do not result in further prolonged litigation. We would suggest, therefore, that this exercise is undertaken expeditiously. Reasons for Decision Background 2. The initial request for information was made by Dr Peter Bowbrick (Dr Bowbrick) to Nottingham City Council (the Council) in an email to Mr Alan Stead (Mr Stead) a Service Manager and head of the team responsible for freedom of information at the Council on 8th January 2005 (the Request). The email was headed access to information request, Freedom of Information Act 2000, and asked for the following information to be provided: Bluecoat School Wollaton Park Site All documents, electronic and other, including minutes of meetings concerning the handing over of the former Margaret Glenn Bott School to Bluecoat. This should include enquiries from members of the public and responses to them. This should include details of who was consulted. All contracts and other agreements between any public body (including Government, Nottingham City Council and the LEA) and Bluecoat, including, for instance, 1. Contacts of sale, 2. Leases, 3. Maintenance agreements and 3Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 4. Agreements on the education of children Informal agreements as well as formal are required. Any agreements between Bluecoat School and the Council regarding the use of the land and buildings on the former Margaret Glen Bott site. 3. Dr Bowbrick offered to provide additional clarification of the request if required. This offer was not taken up. 4. Mr Tony McGovern (Mr McGovern) the Chief Risk Officer at the Council wrote to Dr Bowbrick on 7th February 2005 and referred to the request for information relating to the Bluecoat School Wollaton Park Site. The letter stated that the previously supplied information should answer the queries. It also stated that if not satisfied with the response, Dr Bowbrick could make a complaint and an information leaflet explaining the complaints procedure was enclosed. The letter also explained that if following a response to the complaint Dr Bowbrick remained dissatisfied, he could approach the IC. 5. On 8th February 2005 Dr Bowbrick both emailed and wrote to Mr McGovern stating that he had not received any information relating to his specific questions. On the same day Dr Bowbrick also wrote to the Customer and Information Services Division under the complaints procedure stating that he had made a freedom of information request and that he had been refused any information. 6. On 15th February 2005 Mr Tony Austin a Solicitor to the Council wrote to Dr Bowbrick informing him that schools are regarded as being separate public bodies under FOIA and would probably hold the information he had requested. The letter continued “Therefore the information you require is not held by the Local Authority other than that which has already been provided to you.” He was also referred to a number of steering committee reports which could be obtained from the Education Department. Finally it stated that information relating to future proposals for the school were in draft form and therefore subject to an exemption at Section 22 of FOIA. This letter also referred again to the complaints procedure and reference to the IC. From here in onwards we will refer to this letter as the ‘Refusal Notice’. 4Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 7. The information which had been provided was in response to a request made before FOIA came into effect and was a copy of the Scheme for Financing Schools in the City of Nottingham Local Authority. In the Tribunal’s view this information had little or no relevance to the Request. 8. The IC issued a decision notice on 5th July 2005 in effect upholding the Refusal Notice. A revised decision notice was issued on 1st August 2005 correcting the name of the public authority involved (the Decision Notice). The process before the Tribunal 9. Dr Bowbrick appealed to the Tribunal on 10th July 2005 and the Council was ordered to be joined as a party on 12th August 2005 (the Joinder Notice) together with the following direction “that the Nottingham City Council provide to the Tribunal all documents and other information in their possession, including minutes of council meetings, in relation to the closure of Margaret Glen Bott School, Wollaton Park, in 2004 and/or its merger with Nottingham Bluecoat School, Aspley Lane in 2004 by 29 August 2005, indicating which documents and information are covered by the exemption claimed in the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice date 5 July 2005.” 10. The Council did not comply with the direction by 29 August 2005. However at the Directions Hearing on 3 October 2005 (October Hearing) the Council appeared to be very helpful and as a result the Tribunal ordered “The Council agrees that between 3 October 2005 and 24 October 2005 it will use its best endeavours: a. To identify, in discussion with the Appellant, any documents in the possession of the Council falling within the scope of this request made under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and b. To provide to the Appellant any information that ought to have been provided to him in response to that request.” 11. Also at the October Hearing the matter of exempt information was dealt with. The Council was ordered, in effect, to identify any information for which it was claiming an exemption and then to disclose this to the Tribunal in confidence. The issue of exemptions and confidentiality is dealt with by the Tribunal in its Practice Direction of March 2006 and Ruling in Sugar v The Information Commissioner and the British Broadcasting Corporation (12 May 2006, Case 5Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 Number EA/2005/0032). This has necessitated the Tribunal having private exchanges with the Council, even though the Tribunal still needed to determine whether exemptions claimed before the Tribunal which had not been disclosed previously, could in fact still be claimed. This important issue is dealt with later in this decision. The confidential exchanges have taken place with the knowledge of the other parties but without disclosing to them the contents of such exchanges, which would otherwise defeat the object of providing for exemptions under FOIA. Again this issue is more specifically dealt with later in this decision. 12. As a result the October Hearing was stayed pending this exercise taking place in hopeful anticipation that this would lead to Dr Bowbrick being provided with the information he had requested. 13. At the October Hearing it was envisaged in exchanges between Dr Bowbrick and Mr Stead that Dr Bowbrick would visit the Council’s offices if necessary for several days to help identify the documents. This was recognised by Mr Stead’s email to Dr Bowbrick of 7th October 2005 (email of 7th October 2005). Although there were some email exchanges following the October Hearing, no meeting or face to face discussion took place and it would appear that the Council took the unilateral decision that it was unnecessary as is again evidenced by the email of 7th October 2005. The Tribunal notes that, in evidence before the Tribunal at the full hearing in June 2006, Mr Stead denied that it had been envisaged that Dr Bowbrick would visit the Council’s offices to help identify the information requested. This was not the recollection of the Chairman of this Tribunal, or as evidenced by the order, email exchanges and Dr Bowbrick in his evidence. 14. Around 20th October 2005 the Council sent information to Dr Bowbrick in relation to the order. On 23rd October 2005 Dr Bowbrick provided a detailed analysis of this information running to some 18 pages indicating what he regarded to be still missing and that he still wished to pursue the appeal as the information he had requested had not been provided. 15. The Council did not respond to this analysis and the Tribunal decided to reconvene the Directions Hearing on 9th December 2005 (December Hearing). A few days before the December Hearing the Council let it be known that it would be making further disclosures of approximately 1000 pages of information, but without giving a reasonable opportunity before 6Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the December Hearing for Dr Bowbrick to consider these disclosures. At the December Hearing Dr Bowbrick was ordered “By 31 January 2006…to lodge with the Tribunal, and serve on the other parties, his written response to the Council’s most recent disclosure of information, explaining: a. whether he considers that the Council has now made a full and proper response to his request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and b. if not, in what respects he maintains that the Council’s response is still defective.” 16. Dr Bowbrick carried out this exercise and by letter dated 15th January 2006 to the Tribunal indicated there were still substantial gaps in the information supplied, and that there had not be an adequate response to his original analysis of 23rd October 2005. 17. At the December Hearing both the IC and Council admitted that the Decision Notice could not stand in view of the disclosures which had already taken place, which amounted to approximately 1000 pages of information and there was further information for which the Council claimed exemptions under FOIA. These exemptions were being claimed for the first time before the Tribunal. They had not been raised in the Refusal Notice or during the IC’s investigation of Dr Bowbrick’s complaint. 18. Other directions were made in order for the case to be prepared for the full hearing which eventually took place between 27th and 29th June 2006 (the Full Hearing). The Council made a further disclosure in March 2006.. 19. Early on in the Full Hearing the parties were invited by the Tribunal to take the opportunity to agree among themselves what further information might be provided in response to the Request. They agreed to take up the opportunity and as a result the hearing was adjourned while these deliberations took place over approximately two days. What resulted was the production of a 36 numbered points document which the Council agreed to respond to under the terms of further directions dated 30th June 2006 (June Directions) and which also gave directions as to how the parties should respond to the Council’s response. 7Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 20. The Council responded to the 36 points providing further limited disclosures to Dr Bowbrick and claiming further exemptions in relation to new information discovered. Dr Bowbrick considered this response and again found it did not finally satisfy his Request. 21. As a result the Tribunal reconvened the Full Hearing on 11th September to make its determination based on the papers before it, the parties having agreed that there was no further need for an oral hearing at this stage of the proceedings. Jurisdictional point 22. At the commencement of the Full Hearing Mr Jones on behalf on the Council invited the Tribunal to substitute a decision notice that requires the Council to make a proper response to Dr Bowbrick’s request. He argued that Part V of FOIA restricts the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to an appeal against the decision notice served by the IC pursuant to s.50 FOIA, and that there is no jurisdiction to deal with any other matter and certainly not acts, omissions or decisions of a public authority which are not the subject of the decision notice. 23. He further argued that the appeal process provides a filter to enable issues to be narrowed and reduce the need for and length and expense of appeals further up the ladder. In this case he proposed that we should allow the appeal which would have the effect of setting aside the decision notice and leaving it to the IC to make a fresh decision. 24. The difficulty with the course proposed by Mr Jones is that any substitute request would in effect cover the disclosure that has been made so far to Dr Bowbrick and therefore the question as to whether there is any further information that should be disclosed would be left unresolved. Mr Jones says that this issue could be dealt with by going through, first of all, an internal review and then a complaint to the Commissioner, and then a further appeal to this Tribunal. So in effect the whole procedure would go back to square one. Mr Jones contended that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to take any other course. 25. The Tribunal does not accept his argument about jurisdiction. Under s.58(1) FOIA the Tribunal can “allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner."" The question in this appeal is what, if any, substitute notice the Tribunal could serve, and in order to answer that question, the Tribunal needs to address the question as to whether the Council holds any further information other than the information that it has 8Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 disclosed or the information that it has identified in relation to which it has claimed an exemption. Therefore the Tribunal needs to engage with two questions. Firstly, is Dr Bowbrick correct when he says that there is yet further information that he has identified that has not been supplied? Secondly, is he also correct when he says that to the extent that the Council has relied on exemptions, it cannot do so because it has raised these exemptions too late. The Tribunal needs to resolve those two questions in order to decide what substitute notice it should serve, should the Tribunal decide to do so. 26. Moreover s.50(4), provides for what the Commissioner should do in a case where he considers that the public authority has failed to communicate information. In such a case the decision notice must specify the steps which must be taken for complying with the requirement. In other words, the decision notice does not simply require the public authority to go back and have another go at complying with the Act. The Commissioner's decision notice would require the disclosure of specified information within a time period. Similarly where the Tribunal serves a substitute decision notice, the substitute decision notice needs to set out the information to be disclosed within a time period. Alternatively, the substitute decision notice might acknowledge that all the relevant information has been communicated, but has been done so late, or that the public authority had failed to comply with other procedural requirements of FOIA. 27. Mr Jones also seems to be submitting that the Tribunal may only review the facts on which the notice in question was based. He says what has happened since this appeal was brought cannot possibly be part of the facts on which the decision was based. However both the IC and the Council have accepted that the findings of fact of the Commissioner, that the Council did not hold any relevant information, cannot stand. The Tribunal may review that finding of fact under s.58(2) FOIA in the light of evidence that has emerged since the Commissioner's decision. We are not confined to looking at the evidence that was before the Commissioner. Part of the process of reviewing a finding of fact is deciding what finding of fact should be put in its place. Then the choice for the Tribunal is to substitute a finding of fact that the information held by the Council is the information that has since been disclosed or, alternatively, to substitute a finding of fact that the information held by the Council is the information that has since been disclosed and certain further information in addition. Depending on which of those two findings of fact that the Tribunal substitutes, this will then feed into the decision that the Tribunal makes about what substitute notice, if any, the Tribunal should make. 9Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 28. Returning to the scope of the Full Hearing there are three possible options. The first is that the Tribunal could find that there has now been compliance with the Act but it is very late and we will allow the appeal because the Commissioner's decision notice cannot stand because it is based on an error of fact, but we do not need to go any further because, albeit the request has been complied with late, the Council has done what it was required to do. The second option is to find that the Council may have done what it was required to do but we, the Tribunal, think that we should substitute a decision notice that makes clear in what respects the Council failed to comply with the Act. The third option is for the Tribunal to find that the Council has taken certain steps but it still has not fully complied, and in order fully to comply it has to take the following steps. 29. In order to choose between those three options, the Tribunal needs to ascertain, firstly, does the Council hold any further relevant information. Secondly, can the Council in principle rely on exemptions which it has only raised in the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal. Thirdly, if it can, are the particular exemptions that it has invoked, rightly invoked in the particular circumstances of this case. Whether the Decision Notice can stand 30. The IC and the Council have agreed the Decision Notice cannot stand. The Council admits that it did hold information the subject of the Request. The Refusal Notice was issued in breach of s.1 FOIA. The IC admits it was wrong in law in having upheld the Refusal Notice and dismissing Dr Bowbrick’s complaint under s.50 FOIA because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct. Under s.58(1)(a) we find the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. 31. The next matter for the Tribunal to decide is whether to allow the appeal or issue a revised decision notice under s.58(1) FOIA, and if so on what terms. The decision on which option to take depends on whether or not the Tribunal should order the Council to disclose further documents to Dr. Bowbrick. Therefore the Tribunal needs to consider whether the Council hold further documents falling within the Request that it ought now to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick. 32. We accept that despite a long drawn out process the Council has now made extensive attempts to locate the relevant information. These have been set out at length in response to direction orders, the witness statements prepared by the Council and evidence given by those witnesses at 10Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the Full Hearing, and in the detailed material prepared by the Council following that hearing. In the light of all of this material, which is now very extensive, the Tribunal concludes that the Council has now conducted the sort of investigations that it should have conducted at the outset, which would, in the Tribunal’s view, have avoided the lengthy litigation in this case. 33. We appreciate that Dr Bowbrick is still not satisfied with the Council’s investigations but we do not believe that if the Tribunal ordered, in effect, further investigations, bearing in mind the Tribunal has seen in confidence many other documents to which the Council has claimed an exemption that such investigations would result in further disclosures. The matter of exemptions is dealt with in detail below and the Tribunal does find that some of the documents claimed to be subject to exemptions should be disclosed. Can exemptions be claimed for the first time before the IC 34. The Council has supplied certain documents to the Tribunal in relation to which it claims exemption under FOIA. 35. The Council is relying on exemptions in this appeal, which are exemptions that it did not invoke either in its initial reply to Dr Bowbrick or in the course of the IC's investigation. Therefore the Tribunal needs to decide whether the Council is debarred from relying on those exemptions because they are only raised at this late stage, that is to say, following the appeal to the Tribunal. If the Council is debarred from relying on those exemptions, then there is no need to consider whether they have been properly invoked in relation to the disputed information. This is an important general question for the Tribunal in terms of the scope of the Tribunal's enquiry. 36. If the Council can rely in principle on exemptions claimed at this late stage, then the next matter for us to decide is whether the particular information in question falls within the particular exemptions relied on. The principal exemption now being claimed is that of legal professional privilege (LPP) under s.42 FOIA. The Council has provided certain information to the Tribunal only. As stated earlier in this decision there has been a process of confidential written exchanges between the Tribunal and the Council in order to properly determine whether the material put before us in confidence is caught by the exemption being claimed, and if so whether the public interest balance has been correctly carried out. Inevitably these exchanges have to be confidential because, if they are made public at this stage and disclose the content of the disputed information, that would pre-empt the very question that is at issue, which is whether 11Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 that disputed information should be disclosed to Dr Bowbrick or not. If an appellant finds out the content of the information from what is said at the Tribunal appeal, then the Tribunal appeal would be rendered futile. This is a problem that recurs time and again before this Tribunal given the nature of our jurisdiction and the questions that we are trying to resolve and why the Tribunal have issued a Practice Direction on confidential information and issued a ruling on the subject in Sugar (cited above). 37. In order to deal with that question of principle about exemptions a good starting point is to turn back to the language of FOIA. Under s.1(1) the general right of access to information held by public authorities falls into two parts. The right to be informed, whether the authority holds information of the description specified in the request; and then the right to have the information communicated. From the point of view of the public authority, there is a duty to confirm or deny which corresponds to s.1(1)(a) and a duty to communicate which corresponds to s.1(1)(b). 38. The duty to confirm or deny is something that does not play a major part either in most of the IC's decisions or in most of the appeals so far to the Tribunal, because the duty in itself is a very limited duty. It is not a duty to provide a list of documents that the public authority holds falling within the scope of the request. It is a duty to say whether the public authority holds any relevant information or not. So in most cases that duty is relatively easy to comply with. The real issue is in relation to what is the duty to communicate. In other words the duty that corresponds to s.1(1)(b); the right for the requester to have information communicated to him or her. That duty exists, except in circumstances where there is a relevant exemption. S.2 provides that that duty does not arise either in respect of information that falls within an absolute exemption or within a qualified exemption provided in the latter case that the balance of the public interest is in favour of maintaining the exemption rather than disclosure. 39. S.2 FOIA is framed in terms that the duty to communicate does not arise if certain provisions apply. It is not framed in terms that if a public authority contends that an exemption is applicable and that contention is upheld by the IC or the Tribunal, then the duty to communicate does not arise. S.2 says that if an exemption applies, the relevant duty does not arise. 40. However, there are also procedural duties on the public authority in respect of exemptions under ss. 10 and 17 of FOIA. S.10 sets the time limit for compliance with requests, in general not later than the 20th working day following receipt. S.17 requires that where a public authority is 12Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 relying on an exemption, then within the same timescale for complying with the s.10 duty, it has to notify the requester in essence that it is relying on an exemption and why the exemption applies, if that is not otherwise apparent. Where a qualified exemption is relied upon, the public authority also has to set out its reasons for claiming that the balance of the public interest is in favour of maintaining the exemption. 41. S.17(1) requires the public authority to provide the applicant with a notice containing certain information within the time limit in s.10(1). S.10(3) allows an extension of time where qualified exemptions are being claimed in order to apply the public interest test, but at the end states that ""this subsection does not affect the time by which any notice under section 17(1) is to be given."" This would appear to mean that public authorities have to give the s.17(1) notice within the time limit specified in s.10(1), namely by the 20th working day following receipt, but under s.10(3) a potential extension of time for disclosure is given in cases where there is a qualified exemption at stake, and in those cases the public authority has “until such time as is reasonable in the circumstances.” This means that authorities have at the most 20 working days to specify the exemptions that they rely on, but if they are relying on a qualified exemption, then they may be entitled to further reasonable time in order to decide where the balance of public interest lies and a further reasonable time to communicate the information in question, if the authority’s decision is that the information ought to be communicated. 42. If a public authority does not raise an exemption until after the s.17(1) time period, it is in breach of the provisions of the Act in respect to giving a proper notice because, in effect, it is giving part of its notice late. However FOIA does not say that that failure to specify the exemption within the 20 working day time limit means that the authority is disentitled thereafter from relying on the exemption in any way. If the intention of FOIA had been that the exemption could no longer apply to the information in such circumstances then it would have been expected that the Act would say this in very clear terms, because otherwise it is a very draconian consequence of the failure to comply with the statutory time limit. 43. Where there is a complaint to the IC under s.50 the Commissioner has various obligations. Specifically under s.50(4), where the IC decides that there has been a failure to communicate or a failure to confirm or deny, then the effect of s.50(4)(a) is that the decision notice issued by the Commissioner has to specify what the authority must do and the period within which those steps 13Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 must be taken. Similarly, if there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of ss. 11 or 17, the decision notice must specify what should be done and when it should be done. 44. The interesting point about s.50(4) is that it is treating a failure to communicate or confirm or deny and a failure to comply with the time limits in s.17 as being two separate issues. There is the issue in relation to compliance with the s.17 time limit. Then there is the issue of compliance with the duty to confirm or deny under s.50(4)(a). If there has not been compliance then the IC must specify steps to be taken to comply. What the Commissioner is looking at is whether the request has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 FOIA - s.50(1). If there has been a failure by the public authority to identify a particular exemption that it relies on and that exemption has not been identified until the Commissioner's investigation is underway, then there has been a failure to comply with s.17 and the Commissioner should record that, and if that failure is ongoing, the Commissioner should require steps to be taken to rectify it. 45. There is a separate question as to whether there has been a failure to comply, not just with s.17 but with the s.1 duty to communicate. In order to determine whether there is a failure to comply with that duty to communicate, the IC has to decide whether this is information in relation to which the duty to communicate arises. In order to decide that, the IC has to take into account any exemption claimed, notwithstanding that the exemption is raised later than it should have been done in the process. The Commissioner needs to look at the information, to look at the exemption that has been claimed, to ascertain whether the exemption is properly applicable or not. If it is, then the duty does not arise in respect of that information, and so the failure to communicate the information was not in itself a breach of the requirements of the Act. A differently constituted division of this Tribunal in Mitchell v The Information Commissioner (10 October 2005, Case Number EA/2005/0002 at paragraph 16), supported this reasoning, although not having to decide the point. 46. However the IC does not have a positive duty to look for exemptions that might have been claimed by the public authority, but have not been claimed by the authority. If a public authority fails to invoke a particular exemption before the IC, and the Commissioner orders disclosure of the information, the public authority cannot then come to this Tribunal and say it was an error of law for the Commissioner to fail to put forward on our behalf a particular exemption which we did not put forward on our own behalf. If the public authority raises an 14Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 exemption, the Commissioner needs to consider whether that exemption is applicable, but if the public authority does not raise an exemption, the Commissioner does not have a positive duty to look for exemptions on which the public authority might rely. 47. If the Tribunal were to find differently, then the whole basis of FOIA would be undermined. FOIA is not drafted to find ways to withhold information. 48. Moreover public authorities have discretion as to whether they wish to claim an exemption. Even if information could be exempt the authority does not have to invoke an exemption. In general, it is the public authority that is in a position to identify reasons why particular information may give rise to particular exemptions. It is the public authority that in the first instance is expected to carry out the balancing exercise between the public interest and disclosure and the public interest in maintaining an exemption. It is not the scheme of the Act that the Commissioner should have a general duty to consider the application of any possible exemption, even if not raised by the public authority. 49. The Commissioner, however, would be entitled to look for an appropriate exemption in some exceptional cases. This could happen where a public authority claims a particular exemption and the Commissioner considers that the authority has mis-identified the correct exemption. For example, there is a close relationship between the exemptions in s.30 (investigations) and s.31 (law enforcement). The information can only be within s.31 if it is outside s.30 and sometimes there is an issue as to where the particular information falls. 50. Another example would be where the exemption may have been claimed under the wrong jurisdiction and it would make sense to consider any similar exemption under the correct jurisdiction. This is what happened in Kirkaldie v The Information Commissioner (4 July 2006, Case Number EA/2006/0001) where a differently constituted division of this Tribunal found that the Commissioner had wrongly considered the complaint under FOIA when the request was for environmental information under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The public authority claimed the LLP exemption under s.42 FOIA, which the Tribunal held could, in effect, be considered under a similar exemption under Regulation 12(5) of the 2004 Regulations. 15Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 51. A further example of such an exceptional case could be where the personal data exemption is claimed under s.40. The IC is in the position of being the guardian of both the rights of data subjects under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and of the rights of people seeking information under FOIA. If the Commissioner considered that there was a s.40 issue in relation to the data protection rights of a party, but the public authority, for whatever reason, did not claim the exemption, it would be entirely appropriate for the Commissioner to consider this data protection issue because if this information is revealed, it may be a breach of the data protection rights of data subjects. Otherwise it would put the Commissioner in a very strange position where the Commissioner is responsible for both freedom of information compliance and data protection compliance. S.40 is designed to ensure that freedom of information operates without prejudice to the data protection rights of data subjects. Therefore it would be a very curious situation if the Commissioner had to forget about his data protection enforcement role when he had his freedom of information hat on. 52. The Tribunal would reiterate that there is no suggestion that there is a general duty on the Commissioner to seek potentially relevant exemptions if those had not been invoked by the public authority before the Commissioner. If there was a general duty on the Commissioner to seek relevant exemptions, then a public authority could sit back and do absolutely nothing during the Commissioner's investigation, making no submissions to the Commissioner as to why information was exempt, but then come to this Tribunal and argue that the Commissioner's decision is wrong in law because the Commissioner failed in his legal duty to seek relevant exemptions that might apply. Can exemptions be claimed for the first time before the Tribunal 53. We next need to consider the situation of the Tribunal in an appeal under s.57 FOIA. The Tribunal must consider whether a decision notice is not in accordance with law or involves a wrong exercise of discretion. If the answer to both question is no then the appeal must be dismissed: s.57(1). If the public authority appeals against an IC’s decision requiring disclosure, and the only basis for the appeal is that the Commissioner ought to have found that the information fell within a particular exemption, then if the exemption was not raised by the public authority in the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, then the appeal is bound to fail. There can be no basis for suggesting that the IC erred in law or wrongly exercised his discretion, merely by failing to raise the point on the public authority’s behalf. 16Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 54. However, the present case is different. In this case it is the complainant who appeals. It is accepted by the Council and the Commissioner that the Decision Notice cannot stand. The Tribunal thus has the choice between merely allowing the appeal, or substituting a revised Decision Notice. If the Tribunal does the latter then it needs to decide what should be the terms of the revised notice. In deciding whether there should be a revised notice, and if so on what terms, it is relevant for the Tribunal to take account of a claim by the public authority that an exemption applies in respect of particular information. The Tribunal is in effect exercising the powers of the Commissioner at this point. We ought not to ignore the public authority’s claim that an exemption applies, just as the Commissioner ought not to ignore a similar claim if it is raised during his investigation. If the claim is well-founded then the Tribunal ought not to order disclosure, just as in comparable circumstances the Commissioner ought not to order disclosure. 55. The consequences of any other approach to the Tribunal’s powers might well be seriously unjust. Mr Pitt-Payne provides the following hypothetical case. One of the items of information that falls within the scope of a particular request is a piece of legal advice. Unfortunately the public authority overlooks the existence of the advice until after an appeal has been lodged with the Information Tribunal arising out of the way in which the request was dealt with. The public authority discloses the existence of the advice but contends that it is exempt under s.42 FOIA. Must s.42 be disregarded merely because the existence of this particular item of information was previously overlooked? The Tribunal considers it is in a similar position to the Commissioner as set out above, namely that we are obliged to consider any exemption claimed, even if it is claimed for the first time before the Tribunal as in this case. 56. However the Tribunal finds, in the same way as for the IC, that it does not have a general duty to consider whether there are any relevant exemptions and to apply them if it considers that there might be, even if no party has raised any relevant exemptions. In a situation like the present case, where the public authority says there is a relevant exemption, the Tribunal needs to decide whether there is such an exemption, because that is a step on the way to deciding whether this Tribunal is going to order disclosure by way of variation of the decision notice, and if the Tribunal is going to make a substituted order then what will be the terms of that order. 57. The Tribunal then needs to decide, whether the particular exemptions relied upon in relation to the disputed information, are properly applicable. 17Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 Findings in relation to exempt information 58. The Tribunal has thoroughly reviewed the confidential information which has been disclosed to the Tribunal in this case principally in two tranches, one before the Full Hearing and one during the Full Hearing. The confidential disclosure not only identifies the document and the exemption claimed but also explains how the Council has applied the public interest test (PIT) in favour of non disclosure. The Tribunal comments that the two bundles of confidential information duplicate some documents which has made it confusing at times for the Tribunal to consider. 59. The Tribunal finds that all the confidential information with five exceptions is subject to the LPP exemption under s.42 FOIA. The exceptions include minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” which have been claimed to subject to LLP. This is clearly wrong and these documents should be disclosed. We understand from the evidence that these documents may have already been provided to Dr Bowbrick. The other exceptions relate to documents where another exemption has been claimed but without showing how the PIT has been applied by the Council. 60. In relation to the other confidential documents to which the LLP exemption has been claimed we are satisfied that the Council has applied the PIT correctly and that the Council is entitled to withhold the documents. 61. The Tribunal observes that whether an exemption applies depends on the nature of the information at issue and not on the behaviour of a public authority holding that information. The fact that an authority has failed to discharge its substantive obligations under the FOIA, in terms of identifying and providing information, does not alter the nature of the information it holds and the application of the exemptions must still be considered on the facts of each request. 62. The Tribunal observes that it has recently examined the s.42 exemption. In Bellamy v Information Commissioner and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (May 2006, Case Number EA/2005/0023) the Tribunal characterised LPP as ""a fundamental right at least insofar as the administration of justice is concerned"". Privilege can of course be waived, and the Tribunal can make a finding that it has in fact been waived, subject of course to the proviso that 18Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the embargoed material is legitimately the subject of a claim to LPP - see Kirkaldie (cited above) Non compliance with time limits 63. A differently constituted division of this Tribunal has already considered whether the time limits in the Act have teeth – see Harper v The Information Commissioner (15 November 2005, Case Number EA/2005/0001). A number of the early decision notices of the IC were decisions where a public authority had failed to comply with the s.10 time limit and recorded those failures but did not require any further action. If that is how such failures are handled by the IC why should a public authority that wants to delay matters not simply hold on to information until a complaint is made to the Commissioner? As soon as a complaint is made to the IC, the authority then discloses the information, it receives a decision notice, which is in effect a slap over the knuckles and nothing more and with no practical consequences. 64. In Harper we set out what the Commissioner can do with the public authority that is deliberately delaying compliance with the time limits in ss.10 and 17 in order to delay the moment when it has to give disclosure under the Act. Briefly, s.49 reports can be laid before Parliament in effect entitling the Commissioner to name and shame public authorities that behave in this way. Where there is a cynical or persistent or deliberate breach of time limits, the IC could serve an enforcement notice under s.52 requiring proper compliance with the time limits in the future, which could then lead to the failure being certified to the court under s.54 and dealt with as for a contempt of court. Finally under s.48, a recommendation as to good practice can be made which we will refer to again later in this decision. Tribunal’s finding in relation to the Decision Notice 65. Under s.58(1) FOIA where the Tribunal finds that decision notice is not in accordance with the law, the Tribunal has power to “allow an appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner.” As indicated above the Tribunal finds that the Decision Notice is wrong in law, which is accepted by both the Council and the IC because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct. 66. The Tribunal has already concluded above that the Council has now conducted the sort of investigations that it should have conducted at the outset and that as a result significant disclosures have taken place. The Tribunal considers that any further investigation is unlikely to 19Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 result in new disclosures and therefore has reluctantly decided to limit the extent of the revised decision notice as follows. Substituted Decision Notice 67. The Tribunal orders that the Council provide the following documents, for which exemption has been claimed, to Dr Bowbrick within 14 days of the date of this decision: a. From the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence following the December Hearing minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” also dated 22 July 2003; b. From the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence on 3 August 2006: i. An undated document of objection from a parent as redacted in disclosure to the Tribunal at pages 188 to 192 of the bundle; ii. A letter of objection from a Councillor dated 3 July 2003 at page 193 of the bundle; iii. A letter of objection from Ellis Guildford School and Sports College dated 16 July 2003 at page 194 of the bundle. 68. The Tribunal should make the point that we have not considered any information disclosed to us only in confidence by the Council which is dated after the date of the Request because it is not part of this appeal. 69. The Tribunal also makes the following findings: a. That the Council failed to confirm within 20 working days of Dr. Bowbrick’s request that it held information falling within the scope of his request. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(a) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s. 10; b. That the Council failed to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick within 20 working days of his request the information that it held that fell within the scope of his request and that was not subject to any exemption under the Act. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(b) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s.10. 20Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 c. That the Council failed to identify within 20 working days of the request the exemptions upon which it relied in respect of certain documents falling within the scope of Dr. Bowbrick’s request. It thereby failed to comply within its duty under s.17(1) of FOIA within the time limit prescribed by that section. 70. Because of the unsatisfactory way the disclosures have taken place, as is reflected in our findings on costs below, we would recommend that the IC uses its powers under s.48 FOIA to make a practice recommendation to the Council specifying steps which in the Commissioner’s opinion the Council should take in order for it conform with the codes of practice under ss.45 and 46 of FOIA. In relation to this recommendation we are mindful of the fact that Dr Bowbrick has made further requests of the Council and we are anxious that these requests do not result in further prolonged litigation. We would recommend that this exercise is undertaken expeditiously. Costs 71. During this case the Tribunal has had real difficulty in understanding how the Council could have issued the Refusal Notice in the form it did. It is difficult to imagine circumstances where a public authority transferring a school to another organisation holds no information relating to that transfer. This is why the Tribunal joined the Council to this appeal and not surprisingly soon after the October Hearing, information materialised. It took another directions hearing for further information to be provided and at this hearing yet further information has been disclosed. 72. What worries this Tribunal is that soon after the Request, Jeremy Lyn-Cook sent an internal memo in relation to information held by the Education Department only, to Mr Stead dated 25th January 2005 indicating that Dr Bowbrick’s “enquiry is very wide and could run into 6-7 lever arch files relating to the consultation on the closure of MGB and the expansion of Bluecoat.” He continued “it will probably take more than 2 days to extract information from the files and therefore, I think he needs to be more specific about what he wants.” There is no evidence that Mr Stead enquired of any other department at this stage. This indicates to us that the Council always knew that they held information relating to the Request. Dr Bowbrick on his own 21Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 initiative offered to help the Council locate the information but his offer was not pursued. What followed was the Refusal Notice stating, in effect, that no information was held. 73. Quite frankly the Tribunal is dismayed at the way the Request has been handled and the conduct of the Council since the commencement of this appeal. The Council appears to have misled Dr Bowbrick and then the IC during his investigation. 74. The Chairman of this Tribunal has sought assurances from the IC at the October Hearing that future complaints would be investigated with more diligence than this case and has received those assurances in a letter to the Chairman of the Tribunal dated 21st October 2005 and in the witness statement of Mr Gerrard Tracey, Assistant Commissioner, dated 28th February 2006 . Also from the moment that it was clear that the Council held information the subject of the Request the Commissioner has accepted that his Decision Notice could not stand and has co- operated with the Tribunal. 75. The same cannot be said of the Council following the Joinder Notice. The Council did not comply with the direction in the notice. Following the disclosures in October 2005 it did not respond to Dr Bowbrick’s analysis of the disclosure which clearly indicated that further investigation was necessary, which then necessitated holding the December Hearing. The Council then made further disclosure but not in a timely way so that it could be considered at that hearing, so a further response was required from Dr Bowbrick after the December Hearing. The Council did not seek to take any further action in relation to this response before the Full Hearing some 6 months later, when it did eventually properly co-operate through the good offices of its Counsel, Mr Jones, after which further disclosures have been made. In the meantime there have been substantial claims for exemption of information, the most recent being after the adjournment of the Full Hearing. In addition there has been duplication of disclosures, giving cause for confusion. It has taken nearly 21 months since Dr Bowbrick’s request to undertake anything like a proper investigation and only after various Tribunal orders and prompting. 76. Dr Bowbrick has applied for costs against both the IC and the Council. The Tribunal’s power to make a costs order is set out in rule 29 of the Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005 (""IT Rules""), which provide as follows: ""(1) In an appeal before the Tribunal … the Tribunal may make an order awarding costs - 22Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 (a) against the appellant and in favour of the Commissioner where it considers that the appeal was manifestly unreasonable; (b) against the Commissioner and in favour of the appellant where it considers that the disputed decision was manifestly unreasonable; (c) where it considers that a party has been responsible for frivolous, vexatious, improper or unreasonable action, or for any failure to comply with a direction or any delay which with diligence could have been avoided, against that party and in favour of any other. (2) The Tribunal shall not make an order under paragraph (1) above awarding costs against a party without first giving that party an opportunity of making representations against the making of the order. (3) An order under paragraph (1) may be to the party or parties in question to pay to the other party or parties either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by that party or parties in connection with the proceedings or the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed). (4) Any costs required by an order under this rule to be taxed may be taxed in the county court according to such of the scales prescribed by the county court rules for proceedings in the county court as shall be directed by the order."" 77. Costs are defined in rule 3(2) of the IT Rules to include ""fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration"". 78. The Tribunal can only award costs against a ""party"". Party is defined in rule 3(3) of the IT Rules to mean 'the appellant, or the Commissioner, or a person joined to an appeal in accordance with Rule 7 …"". The Council has been a party to the appeal proceedings following the Tribunal's rule 7 Joinder Notice at the outset of the proceedings. The Tribunal is therefore authorised to make a costs award against it as well as the IC. 79. Rule 29(1)(3) authorises the Tribunal to make an award of costs against a party and in favour of any other in three circumstances: (1) where ""it considers"" that the party has been ""responsible for frivolous, vexatious, improper or unreasonable action"" or; (2) for ""any failure to comply with a direction"" or; (3) for ""any delay which with diligence could have been avoided"". 80. On the facts of this case, the Council’s failure to conduct a reasonable search for documents and to consider and discharge its obligations under FOIA at the time the request was first submitted by Dr Bowbrick has, at the very least, ""caused delays which with diligence could have been 23Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 avoided"". The subsequent piecemeal provision of information in our view justifies further criticism of the Council’s behaviour. 81. The Council has clearly failed to “comply with a direction”. There have been a number of orders where it has failed to meet the date by which the order should have been complied with. 82. In relation to the first circumstance in rule 29(1)(3) this has, in analogous situations, been considered by tribunals with similar provisions to rule 29. The Financial Services and Markets Tribunal, in a written decision from April 2006 (Baldwin v FSA, Case Number Fin/2005/0011), stressed that it could and should be distinguished from an administrative court charged with applying the Wednesbury unreasonableness test (that is the test formulated for the purpose of determining whether a public authority has acted outside its statutory powers). According to Andrew Bartlett QC, Chairman of the FSMT, “the Tribunal, unlike the court in the Wednesbury case, is expressly directed by paragraph 13 to make its own judgment of what is reasonable: “(1) If the Tribunal considers that a party … has … acted unreasonably”. 83. The FSMT, following a review of the facts, concluded that, in its opinion, the investigation at issue in the proceedings had not been unreasonable and made no order for costs against the FSA. Its approach to the application of its power to award costs contained in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Schedule 13 paragraph 13 is summed up in its conclusion at paragraph 27 of the decision: “Taken analytically item by item, and with the benefit of hindsight, it might be possible to characterise some of the elements of conduct … as unreasonable. But we think it important in this case to keep in mind also the broader picture and not to over-emphasize the significance of any individual feature of the investigation. We also remind ourselves that a wrong view or approach is not necessarily an unreasonable view or approach …” 84. In an earlier case, a differently constituted FSMT appeared to have been guided by the basic, if elusive, principle of ""fairness"". In Davidson v the FSA (30 July 2004) (the notorious ""Plumber case""), the FSMT, although recognising that it could only make a costs order if a party acted unreasonably, noted that ""fairness"" had been a consideration in its review of the facts and its decision of how much the party should be ordered to pay. (There it made an order that the FSA pay 50% of the costs.) 85. The EAT has made costs orders against parties where it has determined that the party's conduct was unreasonable. For example, the EAT has awarded costs against an appellant where the facts indicated that the appellant delayed in withdrawing or abandoning proceedings, or proceeded with unmerited actions contrary to legal advice, or failed to fully engage with the proceedings once the proceedings had commenced. 86. The Tribunal finds that Council, through the offices of Mr Stead, purposefully chose not to carry out a proper investigation, despite being aware that there was a likelihood that the Education Department alone held substantial amounts of information in relation to the Request. 24Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 The Tribunal considers this amounts to ""improper or unreasonable action"". However we are mindful of the considerations taken by other tribunals as set out above in relation to similar powers. The Request was a very early request under FOIA and the Council was no doubt getting to grips with its obligations under the Act and therefore we are not prepared to go so far at to find that the action taken was also “frivolous or vexatious” under rule 29(1)(3). 87. In contrast the Tribunal finds that none of the circumstances set out under rule 29(1)(3) apply to the IC’s conduct. 88. In view of the above findings the Tribunal has decided not to make an order for costs against the IC, but that we will make a cost order against the Council in favour of Dr Bowbrick. 89. Rule 29 provides that the Tribunal can make an order that one party or parties pay ""the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed)"". The Tribunal therefore can direct that the public authority should pay only a portion or part of the costs if it, in its discretion, considers it appropriate to do so following its review of the evidence. Rule 29 requires that parties be given an opportunity to make representations on the award of costs before the Tribunal makes its order. It is open to the parties to agree on the amount of costs and there is no reason why the Tribunal should not encourage them to do so. The Tribunal has already given the opportunity for the parties to do this in the June Order and they have so obliged. The Tribunal has taken these representations into account in coming to its decision set out in the previous paragraph. The Tribunal considers that the parties are so far apart in relation to the amount of costs that there is no point in inviting them to seek agreement and that therefore the matter should go immediately for taxation. 90. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to make any finding on the amount of costs before it orders taxation but it may direct that the public authority should pay only a portion of the applicant’s costs. In the Davidson decision, [cited above], the FSMT first directed, following its review of the facts, that “fairness” required that the FSA pay only half of the applicant’s costs but it expressed no view as to the amount of such costs to be awarded preferring to leave it to be assessed on the standard basis by a costs official. 91. In this case the Tribunal directs that the Council should pay the whole of Dr Bowbrick’s costs. 92. On the issue of taxation, rule 29(4) provides that: “Any costs provided by an order under this rule to be taxed may be taxed in the county court according to such of the scales prescribed by the county court rules for proceedings in the county court as shall be directed by the order.” 93. The county court scales have been replaced by the CPR. CPR 47 sets out the procedure for detailed assessment of costs. According to CPR 47, proceedings are commenced when the receiving party serves on the paying party a notice of commencement and a copy of the bill of costs (CPR 47.6). The receiving party has three months from the date of the Tribunal's order to 25Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 commence proceedings (CPR 47.7). In addition, the costs recoverable by a LIP are set out in CPR 48.6 and as indicated below, these make provision for the recovery of financial loss. 94. The Tribunal directs that Dr Bowbrick’s costs be taxed as a litigant in person (LIP). 95. Alternatively according to rule 29(3), the Tribunal could have made an order: ""to the party or parties in question to pay to the other party or parties either (1) a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by that party or parties in connection with the proceedings; or (2) the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed)."" 96. The Tribunal has decided not to make such an order for a specified sum but for future guidance sets out the basis upon which such an award could be made and also other matters to take into account when considering an award for costs. 97. The Tribunal is authorised to order the payment of a ""specified"" or lump sum to the applicant but only in ""in respect of the costs incurred … in connection with the proceedings"". The limitation of the award to costs ""incurred in connection with the proceedings"" is important. ""The proceedings"" in this context means the appeal before the Tribunal and it does not automatically include costs incurred by the applicant as a result of the public authority's conduct prior to the proceedings or petitioning the IC prior to the commencement of the appeal. 98. This issue was also considered by the FSMT in Baldwin (cited above). The relevant provision in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 provides that "" … it may order [a party] … to pay … the costs and expenses incurred … in connection with the proceedings"". In this case the FSMT was asked to consider whether 'conduct' before the proceedings could be considered in the determination of costs against a party. The FSMT concluded that had the intention been to limit the conduct referred to in the course of the proceedings, the statutory wording would have said so expressly. It concluded that it was entitled to take account of conduct which took place before the reference was made and the proceedings commenced (paragraph 23 of the decision). However, the FSMT also noted at paragraph 26 that its: ""conclusion does not mean that conduct prior to the proceedings is necessarily relevant to the incidence of costs … to be relevant under paragraph 13(1), it must have some bearing on the proceedings. It follows from the very nature of the decision to be taken on costs that our judicial discretion must be exercised on the basis of facts connected with or leading up to the proceedings, as contrasted with conduct wholly unconnected with the proceedings"". 99 .Although rule 29 clearly provides that the Tribunal may order the payment of costs where the conduct of another party has been such that an award against it is merited, rule 3(2) defines costs to include fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration. There is no provision for ""punitive"" damages or other means of ""punishing"" the offending party. 26Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 100. Therefore, should the Tribunal elect to award a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by an applicant, it is clear that its order must relate to the categories of costs defined in rule 3(2) and as required by rule 29, and its order must be limited to those costs incurred by the applicant in connection with the proceedings. 101. The Tribunal should require an applicant to provide it with a schedule of costs incurred in connection with the proceedings which it can then use to inform its decision of what it considers to be an appropriate ""sum"" to award, given the specific circumstances of the case and with a view to ensuring a balanced and fair process for all parties. The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (""CPR"") requires litigants in person to evidence their costs and it would seem reasonable, and indeed fair in the circumstances, for the Tribunal to require some evidence of the applicant's costs in proceedings before it. In addition, the party against which costs are being sort has a right to make representations against the making of the order and the amount of such costs and this includes an opportunity to comment on an applicant’s schedule of costs.. 102. Rule 3(2) permits the Tribunal to include remuneration in its award of costs but it is not clear if it permits the Tribunal to compensate an applicant for lost earnings or to “remunerate” the applicant’s work in connection with the proceedings. The recent decision of the Costs Judge, Master Simons, in Knight v Maggioni (10 April 2006, Case Number 0503654) in an application for costs by a LIP, reaffirmed the position as set out in the CPR that an applicant claiming financial loss must quantify that loss with some degree of specificity. In this case, the applicant could not prove financial loss. He was therefore only compensated at a rate of £9.25 per hour for time spent preparing for and attending the proceedings, as prescribed by section 52 of the CPR Practice Direction about Costs Directions. Where it is exercising its discretion to award a specified sum to a party, the Tribunal is not bound by the provisions of the CPR but there is no reason why it cannot look to it as a guide to its own awards under rule 29, should it think it appropriate to make provision for remuneration in its costs award against a party.

"90","Procedural Refusal","Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2005/0032 Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) Preliminary Hearing heard Decision Promulgated at Procession House London on 14 and 15 June 2006 and at 46 Bedford Square London 29th August 2006 on 5 July, 2006 Before JOHN ANGEL Chairman Henry Fitzhugh and John Randall Lay Members Between STEVEN SUGAR Appellant And THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent And THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION Additional Party Representation: For the Appellant: in person For the Respondent: Mr Paul Nicholls For the Additional Party: Ms Monica Carrs-Frisk QC and Ms Kate Gallafent 1Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Decision At this preliminary hearing the Tribunal finds that at the time of the request made by Mr Sugar to the BBC for a copy of the Balen Report it was held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature. The Tribunal substitutes a partial decision notice to this effect and requires the parties, within 20 days of the date of this decision, to provide written submissions as to how they consider the Tribunal should now best dispose of the appeal. Reasons for Decision The preliminary issue before the Tribunal 1. On 21 March 2006 the Tribunal ordered that two preliminary issues be considered as follows: (a) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and if it found that it did have jurisdiction then the Tribunal would consider the second preliminary issue, namely (b) whether the Balen Report, the information requested by the Appellant under s1(1) the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) in this appeal, was held by the British Broadcasting Corporation (the BBC) for the purposes of journalism or for some other purpose within the meaning set out in Schedule I Part VI to FOIA. 2. The Tribunal already having found that it has jurisdiction, now turns to the second preliminary issue. 3. It should be noted that the Tribunal holds the Balen Report in confidence in accordance with an order of 21 March 2006. 2Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 The request for information 4. On 8 January 2005 Mr Steven Sugar (Mr Sugar) requested by letter to the BBC “a copy of the report by Mr Michael Balen regarding the BBC’s news coverage of the Middle East, in particular the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.” He continued “I understand from press comment about this report that it was provided to BBC management in the last few months of 2004”. Mr Balen’s actual name is Malcolm Balen (Mr Balen). 5. On 11 February 2005 Miss Liz Waite from Information Policy and Compliance BBC Freedom of Information department emailed Mr Sugar informing him that the information he requested was not covered by the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). She continued: “Information about BBC programmes, content and their production is not covered by the Act. The impartiality of our journalism is an important part of the production. (Schedule 1 of the Act says that the BBC is covered in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature).” 6. By email dated 11 February 2005 Mr Sugar asked the BBC to review its decision. The decision was upheld on 16 March 2005. 7. Mr Sugar complained to the Information Commissioner (IC) by letter dated 18 March 2005. The IC issued a provisional decision on 24 October 2005 (the Provisional Decision) indicating that the IC was inclined to conclude that the BBC was correct to have “applied the derogation” to the request. On 2 December 2005 the IC issued a final decision in relation to the request stating that : “(i) the Balen Report is held for the purpose of journalism, art or literature: and (ii) the BBC has correctly applied Part VI of Schedule 1 to the Act.” The statutory framework 8. S.1 FOIA sets out the general right of access to information held by public authorities. S.1(1) states (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority, is entitled – (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. 9. A “public authority” is defined in s.3 FOIA. S. 3(1) provides: 3Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 (1) In this Act ‘public authority’ means- (a) subject to section 4(4), any body which, any other person who, or the holder of any office which – (i) is listed in Schedule 1, or (ii) is designated by order under section 5, or (b) a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6. (Section 4(4) is not relevant to this appeal) 10. S. 7(1) of FOIA provides that: Where a public authority is listed in Schedule 1 only in relation to information of a specified description, nothing in Parts I to V of this Act applies to any other information held by the authority. 11. The BBC is listed in Part VI of Schedule 1 to FOIA, as follows: The British Broadcasting Corporation, in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature. 12. The parties agree that the particular derogation with which this appeal is concerned is that of “journalism”. Journalism 13. FOIA does not define “journalism”. The Oxford English Dictionary provides a number of meanings, for example: • Journalism: the activity or profession of being a journalist; the business or practice of writing and producing newspapers. • Journalist: a person who writes for newspapers or magazines or prepares news to be broadcast on radio or television; a person employed to write or, edit, or report for, a newspaper, journal, or newscast. 14. Mr Maurice Asielue (Mr Asielue), the Senior Complaints Resolution Manager of the IC in the Provisional Decision provides a well considered approach to the meaning of the derogation. He states: 4Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 It is the Commissioner’s view that the ultimate purpose of the derogation is to protect journalistic, artistic and literary integrity by carving out a creative and journalist space for programme makers to produce programmes free from the interference and scrutiny of the public. This position is consistent with the Human Rights Act 1998, as it could be argued that the invasion of this space is a restriction on the programme maker’s ability to exercise free speech. This ultimate purpose is referred to in this letter as the “Creative Journalistic Purpose”. 15. Mr Asielue acknowledges that a source for a definition of the derogation is the “special purposes” under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) which we consider later in this decision. 16. The Provisional Decision interprets the meaning of the derogation “broadly to include all types of output which the BBC produces and broadcasts.” However the Commissioner’s view is that “the derogation is not meant to exclude the more strategic, management and logistic activities of programme-makers from the remit of the Act, except where these activities: (a) deal with the sustenance, promotion and development of the Creative Journalistic Purpose that the derogation is meant to protect: and (b) involve the actual utilisation of creative journalistic, artistic or literary skills.” 17. In this case we have heard different arguments from the parties as to the meaning of “journalism”. In order to illuminate these competing arguments we set out the background to the legislation. Background to the legislation 18. The White Paper, ‘Your Right to Know’, was published in December 1997. It sets out the purpose of FOIA as follows: “This White Paper explains our proposals for meeting another key pledge – to legislate for freedom of information, bringing about more open Government. The traditional culture of secrecy will only be broken down by giving people in the United Kingdom the legal right to know. This fundamental and vital change in the relationship between government and governed is at the heart of this White Paper.” (Prime Minister’s preface) 5Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 19. With the White Paper, the government also published a background paper setting out the key issues which had been considered in the preparation of the White Paper. These were the issues which were considered by the relevant cabinet committee, CRP (FOI), and on which decisions were taken before publication of the White Paper. The cabinet committee considered whether the public service broadcasters (PSBs) should be covered by any proposed Act and stated: “Public Service Broadcasters: the BBC, Channel 4 and S4C are public corporations that operate to a defined remit specified in the Royal Charter (BBC) and legislation (Channel 4 and S4C). All three operate independently of Government editorially and to the greatest extent possible in economic and regulatory terms. It might be regarded as anomalous for them to be within the scope of the FOI legislation when the private media (Channels 3 and 5, cable and satellite channels, the Internet, the press and freelances of all sorts) would not.” 20. From the beginning of the legislative process, the government had considered the position of the PSBs in relation to their editorial independence and competitive position with other broadcasters. When the White Paper was published, however, the BBC, Channel 4 and S4C were included as bodies to whom the Act would apply without any qualification. This decision was explained, some time after the event, in a letter of 9th September 2003 to Rosemary Jay of Masons solicitors from the Information Rights Division of the Department of Constitutional Affairs (the Jay Letter). The letter said: “The conclusion reached was that, subject to the exemptions in the act, the public function carried [by] public service broadcasters meant that they should be publicly accountable, and therefore should be covered by the FOI Act.” (Word in square brackets added by the Tribunal to make sense of the sentence.) 21. On 19 May 1998, the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration published a third report on the White Paper. The report commented on the inclusion of the PSBs (at para 45) as follows; 6Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 The public service broadcasters—the BBC, Channel 4 and S4C will come under the Act. As the White Paper says, ""it might be regarded as anomalous for them to be within the scope of the Freedom of Information legislation when the private media ... would not"". As the Guild of Editors say, their inclusions raise some difficult questions in relation to their newsgathering activities. (They may well argue that other information they hold should be withheld on commercial confidentiality grounds: this is dealt with below, paras. 58 to 66). It is unclear if sources of information could be protected under any of the ""specified interests"" in the White Paper. We recommend that the Government should make this point clear in their response to this Report. 22. On 21 July 1998, the government’s response to the Select Committee’s report was published. The government responded to the Select Committee’s comment on the PSBs inclusion in the Act (at para. 19) as follows: “The Government is clear about the need to ensure that Freedom of Information does not diminish freedom of expression, and the rights of the media under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Government believes that the structure of ""Gateway"" provisions (including barriers to premature disclosure of information due to be published at a future date) together with the specified interests, should provide a good degree of protection for the necessary interests of public service broadcasters. In particular, the ""information supplied in confidence"" specified interest should protect confidential sources of information to journalists, while personal information within the data protection law will be covered by the particular protection given to information held for journalistic purposes. The Government will however, consider carefully as it moves towards publication of a draft FOI Bill, whether anything further is needed to ensure a satisfactory approach to the issue of investigative journalism which the Committee has raised. Broadcasting and other media organisations will of course have an opportunity to comment on the draft Bill after it has been published. 7Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 23. One broadcaster took an early opportunity to comment. On 10 June 1998, Jan Tomalin, Head of Legal and Compliance at Channel 4, wrote to the government minister, Lord Williams of Mostyn, about the effect of FOIA on PSBs. She explained Channel 4 was concerned that FOIA would: “undermine programme-making and hence the steps taken by the Government to ensure that, on Data Protection and Human Rights, the door is not open to prior restraint and other inroads on legitimate free expression.” 24. She went on to say: “We have asked that any freedom of information right which requires Channel 4 to disclose material collected for journalistic purposes be given the most careful scrutiny.” 25. On 25 September 1998, Lord Williams replied to Channel 4 to reiterate that the BBC and Channel 4 would be subject to FOIA because they should be publicly accountable. In response to Channel 4’s point on ‘material collected for journalistic purposes’. Lord Williams said: “I am clear that the Freedom of Information Act must not diminish freedom of expression and the rights of the media under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The proposed ‘Gateway’ provisions and the specified interests should provide the protection needed.” It should be noted that most of these latter provisions and interests have become exemptions under FOIA. 26. It is clear from this exchange that the government recognised the need to consider the impact of Article 10 ECHR in relation to PSBs. For completeness we set out Article 10 ECHR: Article 10 – Freedom of expression 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 8Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. 27. A draft FOI Bill was published in May 1999. It did not expressly include the BBC in its coverage leaving that to be dealt with by statutory instrument, as with other public authorities. 28. On 21 October 1999, an internal BBC memo written by David Fawcett (Mr Fawcett), a Senior Adviser Policy Development, confirmed that several BBC representatives, including himself, had met Home Office officials to continue discussions on the draft Bill. The memo reports on the BBC’s understanding of the outcome of the meeting, and records, in particular the following points made by Home Office officials: “2. As you will recall, setting aside our dismay as journalists at a particularly restricted FOI regime, our position on the draft legislation was: • We accepted that the BBC as a public body should fall within FOI • We were concerned, however, to ensure a distinction between our public functions (equivalent to those of the ITC) and our private functions (like those of other broadcasters or journalists). The draft Bill seemed to provide the vehicle for making this distinction. • If we did not achieve this general protection, we would have to rely on a series of individual exemptions and exclusions in the draft Bill, on which we sought assurance and in some cases suggested improvements in the drafting. • We wanted adequate protection for the free and frank exchange of internal advice and deliberation, similar to that afforded to Whitehall 3. We reiterated these points at the meeting. The main points in response were: • Yes, the BBC would be designated as a public authority for the purposes of FOI 9Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 • But no, the Home Office did not intend to distinguish between our public and private functions – we were not alone in this (see, for example, Health Authorities who “compete” in the health care market), and Ministers were steadfastly refusing to open the floodgates. We were left in no doubt that it was not worth our while pressing this further – far better to focus on areas where concessions were possible. • The Home Office believed that the various exemptions/exceptions in the draft Bill did provide sufficient protection for each of the areas in which we had specific concerns – including our competitive position, protection of our sources etc • The Bill’s provisions were intended to give us the same level of protection for “free and frank exchange” as Whitehall. 4. In addition, officials made two very significant offers: • To seriously consider including in the Bill a specific exemption for “material held for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes”, for which there is a precedent in Data Protection law. This would be a very great prize for us, in the absence of a general distinction between public/private. At a stroke it would exclude most of our day-to-day activities in programmes and journalism. Officials felt that this was a very realistic suggestion, which Ministers could adopt without opening the public/private floodgates • To support the designation of the Board of Governors as a “responsible person” under the legislation for the purposes of deciding what the BBC information would be considered to threaten “free and frank exchanges” or effective conduct of our affairs if released. This was a completely unexpected offer – we had it on our wish list, but barely hoped we would get a positive response. 5. These are the headline points – and the overall picture is now very satisfactory indeed if we can ensure it is delivered.” [Underlining and bold in original] 29. Mr Fawcett followed up the meeting in a letter to Lee Hughes at the Home Office of 22 October 1999. Mr Fawcett accepted that the BBC should be covered by the Act but expressed the BBC’s concern that the Act 10Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 “should not jeopardise the carrying out of our day-to-day functions as a public service broadcaster and journalistic organisation. In both respects, the BBC, though a public body, operates in a competitive marketplace in which ill-timed disclosure of information could seriously affect our ability to fulfil the objects set for us by our Royal Charter. At our meeting, we sought assurances that the way in which the legislation is implemented would recognise the need for confidentiality across much of our day-to-day activities.” 30. Mr Fawcett suggested that the proposed exemption for information intended to be published would not, by itself, be adequate. He expressed concern at: “ having to rely on provisions such as this to protect us from having to provide programme material to the public (or our competitors) on demand. We do not believe that such material should be classed as ‘information’ for the purposes of the Act. Relying on general provisions which do not recognise the special nature of programme material is bound to be unsatisfactory. Here, for example, the clause would enable us to refuse to provide material which we intended eventually to publish. But it would arguably not cover programme material which is not transmitted – for example Out- takes, which may or may not be being held ‘with a view to publication’. We cannot see what public interest would be served by requiring us to make such material available”. 31. He went on to say: “As argued at the meeting, in the absence of a general exemption for our private broadcasting and programme making functions, we would favour instead a solution tailored to these particular circumstances, whereby any information would be exempt from disclosure if it was being held for ‘journalistic, literary or artistic purposes’. This follows the formulation of section 32 of the DPA. We would press strongly for such a provision, and would welcome an early indication of whether Ministers are likely to find it acceptable.” 32. Mr Fawcett also reiterated the argument for the BBC to be included in what has since become s.36 FOIA exemption (prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs) by providing that it 11Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 should cover “any other public authority” and not just government departments. It should be noted that the BBC (through its Governors, sitting as a Board or individually) has been designated as “qualified persons” under the exemption. 33. On 25 October 1999, Mr Hughes replied to Mr Fawcett sending him an advance copy of Schedule I to the Bill and in his letter explained that the BBC had been designated as a public authority “otherwise than in respect of information held for the purposes of journalism, artistic purpose or literary purpose”. 34. The Bill in this form was presented to Parliament on 18 November 1999 and was unchanged, in respect of the derogation, during the Bill’s passage through Parliament and was enacted on 30 November 2000, in this respect, as originally drafted. 35. After publication of the Bill, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was requested by a Japanese broadcaster to ‘expand on the definition of journalism, art or literature’ and to explain why this was excluded from the scope of the Bill. In a letter to the DCMS dated 13 January 2000 (HO Letter), the Home Office said: “The Government has sought to ensure that by including them [the public service broadcasters] in the Bill does not place them at an unfair disadvantage to their commercial rivals. The Bill therefore provides that the inclusion of the public service broadcasters does not relate to information held for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes. The intention behind this limitation is to protect the resource constituted by information gathered by the public service broadcasters for the purpose of programme making. Section 32 of the DPA makes similar provision. Information held by the public service broadcasters in relation to their operation, administration, management, policies etc is covered by the Bill.” 12Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Association with data protection laws 36. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) makes specific provision for “the special purposes …of journalism” (s.3 DPA). It is clear that this provision was included in the DPA in order to ensure compliance with the Article 10 ECHR. This can be seen from the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the DP Directive) upon which the DPA was based. 37. Recital 37 to the DP Directive states that ‘the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or purposes of literary or artistic expression… should qualify for exemption…in so far as necessary to reconcile the fundamental rights of individuals with freedom of information and notably the right to receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in Article 10…’ Article 9 of the DP Directive states: Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations… for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression. It should be noted that exemptions or derogations were only permitted if they were ‘necessary’ to achieve Article 10 compliance. 38. In Goodwin v. United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 123 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), considered the protection of journalists' sources and the extent to which it was acceptable under the ECHR for the English courts to have ordered a journalist to reveal her sources. The ECHR explained the importance of protecting journalists' sources in the following terms (para 39): Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom, as is reflected in the laws and the professional codes of conduct in a number of Contracting States and is affirmed in several international instruments on journalistic freedoms (see, 13Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 amongst others, the Resolution on Journalistic Freedoms and Human Rights, adopted at the 4th European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy (Prague, 7-8 December 1994) and Resolution on the Confidentiality of Journalistic' Sources by the European parliament, 18 January 1994, Official Journal of the European Communities No. C44/34). Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected. Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom, such a measure cannot be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest. 39. The DPA implemented an exemption under s.32(1) for “personal data which are processed only for the special purposes….if - (a) the processing is undertaken with a view to the publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material, (b) the data controller reasonably believes that, having regard in particular to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication would be in the public interest, and (c) the data controller reasonably believes that, in all the circumstances, compliance with that provision is incompatible with the special purposes.” 40. Under s.32(6) the DPA defines the term “publish” as making journalistic, literary and artistic material available to the public or a section of the public. 41. The DPA makes further provisions under s.32(4)-(5) to enable a court to stay proceedings brought against a data controller under other provisions of the DPA if it appears to the court, or 14Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 if the data controller claims, that the processing which is the subject of the proceedings is being carried out for the special purposes and to publication by the data controller (See Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1373 - Lord Phillips, at para. 121). The intention behind this sub-section appears to be to prevent so-called “gagging” orders intended to restrain freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. 42. Mr Nicholls argues that there is a difference between the BBC’s derogation under Schedule 1 FOIA and s.32 DPA, although both are concerned to protect the right to freedom of expression. Under the DPA there is a countervailing interest which needs to be borne in mind and that is the interest in the privacy of the data subject under Article 8 ECHR. Therefore, the right to free expression recognised by s.32, is curtailed by a competing right to privacy. Hence it is personal data processed only for these special purposes, which are exempt from the DPA's various provisions. Under FOIA there are no countervailing interests in relation to the BBC and its position in determining whether it is subject to FOIA. There is an interest similar to that under the DPA in protecting the Article 10 right to freedom of expression. But there is no countervailing interest under Article 8 which falls to limit that freedom. 43. Mr Nicholls finally submits that the scope of the meaning of journalism under the DPA is different from that under FOIA. The exemption under the DPA applies only where information is held ‘solely’ for the purposes of journalism. The derogation under FOIA does not require that the sole purpose for which the information is held is journalism. Hansard 44. Mr Sugar referred the Tribunal to passages in Hansard. Until Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593, the courts denied themselves reference to Hansard for the purposes of interpreting legislation. That case permitted reference but only subject to strictly controlled conditions which are set out in the speech of Lord Browne Wilkinson which is reported at page 634. He said: “ My Lords, I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter of law, there are sound reasons for making a limited modification to the existing rule (subject to strict safeguards) unless there are constitutional or practical reasons which outweigh them. In my judgment, subject to the questions of the privileges of the House of Commons, 15Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity. Even in such cases references in court to Parliamentary material should only be permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words. In the case of statements made in Parliament, as at present advised, I cannot foresee that any statement other than the statement of the Minister or other promoter of the Bill is likely to meet these criteria.” 45. Mr Sugar submitted that references to Hansard were not admissible, although pointing us to a number of passages from Hansard, should we take a different view. We agree that the material referred to us from Hansard does not satisfy the criteria set out in Pepper v Hart and therefore we have not sought to take the Hansard references into account. Background to the Balen Report 46. Richard Sambrook (Mr Sambrook), Director of News at the BBC in 2003, provided the context in which Mr Balen joined the BBC, in evidence to the Tribunal as follows: “In mid-autumn 2003, the BBC was under close scrutiny from lobby groups in relation to its coverage of the Middle East. This scrutiny came from a variety of sources, including pro-Arab and pro-Israeli groups and leading members of the Jewish community. I received a significant amount of correspondence on the subject. Due to the other demands of my job, I was not able personally to engage with these groups to the extent that I would have liked, but considered that it was important for BBC News to do so to a greater extent. I thought it would be useful to have a senior journalist with sound editorial judgment who was able to spend time talking to these groups and engage them in the discussion. This would reflect the BBC’s recognition that the lobby groups’ views 16Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 were important and worthy of being taken seriously, allowing us to better understand the merits of their arguments and, where appropriate, act on them”. It should be noted that Mr Sambrook had a very senior role at the BBC responsible for a large number of employees. 47. Subsequently, Mr Sambrook hired Mr Balen. Mr Sambrook said in evidence: “I discussed the idea with him initially because I knew that he was available and I had worked with him in the past and had a great deal of respect for him, and once I established that he would be interested in the role I discussed it with Mark Byford, who was then the Director of the World Service, because clearly that is the other important dimension of the BBC journalism, the international journalism” [Transcript 15th June p11]. 48. In relation to the appointment Mr Sambrook explained: “I think there were two aspects to employing Malcolm Balen which were unusual: one was to bring somebody in with a particular focus in that way, which I do not think we have done before. We often had asked for reviews of our coverage and had had intensive periods of reviewing aspects of coverage, not just the Middle East, but politics and business and many other things as well, but the normal pattern would be to second an editor into looking at that for a period of time. Indeed, when Malcolm was editor of The Nine O’Clock News I think he was seconded in that way for periods of time to do particular reports. But it was unusual to bring somebody in certainly. But one of the reasons I decided to do that I believed it would be a benefit to have somebody focused purely on that and was not also having to manage programme teams and manage bureau and so on as well. I thought there would be a benefit to having not only the concentrated attention, but somebody who was, if you like, free from those other pressures. I think the other unusual aspect of it was that from the very beginning I believed it was right that this role should have an external focus as well, because there was a high level of lobbying and concern and complaint, and therefore I thought it 17Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 appropriate and responsible of us to actively engage with that and take a view about whether those were justified or not” [Transcript 15th June p8-9]. 49. Mr Balen signed a contract on 17 October 2003 to work as “Middle East Consultant in News” from 1 November 2003 to 31 October 2004. Mr Balen’s duties and responsibilities were not specified in his contract, and in evidence to the Tribunal, he explained that his role at entry was “not clearly defined”. In evidence to the Tribunal Mr Sambrook explained: “I think it is quite important to understand that the role was originally envisaged as a support to me as Director of News, and somebody who could simply pay attention and advise me personally on the rights and wrongs of some of the complaints, but also take a view, as I say, across a period of time about our coverage and come up with some thoughts about how we strengthen our coverage going forward. So from that point of view it was not a formal position in the sense of an editorship would be, or a senior managerial responsibility, which is why it was configured as a senior editorial adviser. Malcolm, of course, is very well known and respected within BBC News, so I knew he would be able to build strong relationships with programme editors and so on as well. But it was very much an experiment. …….. it was an unusual appointment, we had not done it this way before, so it was an experiment to some extent, and I think Malcolm and I decided we would agree the broad areas and broadly how it might work, but see how it evolved over the first few months and redefine it as we went along”.[Transcript 15th June p12-13] 50. Mr Balen was later referred as an “adviser”. Mr Sambrook explained this change in evidence to the Tribunal: “He was concerned, and we did have a discussion, that he should be clearly positioned as separate from the programme teams and programme management, yes. Whether or not ‘consultant’ and ‘advisor’ reflect that independence, or there is a difference to the extent to which they reflect that independence, you know, I mean I do not think people judge. But I think the issue was much more that he was going to be positioned as not 18Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 having line management responsibilities, and we believed that although contractually – as I have said before, the basis of the BBC contract was to contract him as a consultant – he was ‘consultant’, we felt ‘adviser’ more properly reflected the role he was playing within the organization” [Transcript 15th June p17-18]. 51. Mr Balen was introduced to BBC staff by emails sent by Mr Mark Byford (Mr Byford) the then Director of World Service and Mr Sambrook. These emails exemplify further the lack of specificity of Mr Balen’s day-to-day role. On 31 October 2003 Mr Sambrook sent the following email to his News Leadership Group: “I’m pleased to say that Malcolm Balen will be rejoining BBC as a senior editorial advisor working for me and to Mark Byford on Middle East coverage. This is a particularly difficult and sensitive area for all broadcasters where we are subject to significant pressure and complaints from all parties. We believe BBC News will benefit from the dedicated attention of a senior and highly experienced editorial figure who can help manage the pressures on us and advise us on the complexities of the current situation. He will support us in continuing to deliver strong, accurate and independent journalism on Middle East affairs. Malcolm’s experience as a senior programme editor at BBC, ITN and Channel 4 will be invaluable in this role”. 52. Mr Byford sent an email on 3 November 2003 to his team stating that “For information, Malcolm will be helping to co-ordinate and advise on all ME coverage including our own”, together with a copy of Mr Sambrook’s email of 31 October 2003. 53. For approximately the first four months of Mr Balen’s appointment he delivered fortnightly or monthly reports to Mr Sambrook, and he addressed some external complaints about BBC coverage of the Middle East and met with internal editors and journalists to discuss Middle East coverage. 54. From about February 2004 Mr Balen’s main focus became the production of a report which he worked on for approximately six months. He explained in evidence: 19Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 “I was concerned in my report to do two things: one was to examine the pattern of the complaints against the BBC and, if you like, examine the coverage that I was reviewing through the filter of those complaints, to see whether I thought the complaints were justified or not, not individual complaints but the pattern of them. I was also examining, over time, a considerable amount of BBC output to see what it added up to over time, how those individual decisions, journalistic decisions, on a daily basis, what they amounted to in their totality”. [Transcript 15th June p99-100] 55. Mr Balen admitted that he had no idea how Mr Sambrook intended to use the report and explained: “To be honest, I did not really have an expectation. The idea of the report grew, I think Richard probably mentioned it verbally to me when I rejoined the BBC and I do remember him saying, it was either late-2003 or early-2004, reminding me he did want a report. We decided, as I sort of looked at coverage, it was easier to handle if it was a written report … As far as I was concerned, I was writing this report for Richard and I did not know what was going to happen to it. As such, the recommendations that I framed, I framed them in what I might term ‘quite a soft way.’ He did not ask me for recommendations. I felt the natural conclusion of the report was that there should be recommendations. I did not feel it was my place as somebody who had just come into the BBC as a one year contract to act as Senior Editorial Adviser. I did not feel it was my role to be didactic in what I was saying. They were just simply possibilities that he might wish to explore… To be honest, there was an awful lot of work involved in doing the report. While I say it acquired mythological status, I do stand by my work and did do a lot of work on it and I was busy doing that rather than contemplating what might happen to it when I finished it”. [Transcript 15th June p113-15] 56. Mr Sambrook received a draft of the Balen Report in June 2004 and by email to Mr Balen dated 18 June said “Your report is terrific by the way.” On 5 July 2004, Mr Balen sent by email a later draft of the report to Mr Byford, indicating “it should be ready in a week or so”. 20Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Changes in management and the creation of the Journalism Board 57. In January 2004 the “Report of the Enquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Death of Dr. David Kelly C.M.G.” (The Hutton Report) was published. On 28 January 2004, the chairman of the BBC, Gavyn Davies resigned and Greg Dyke, the Director General, tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the Board of Governors. Eventually a new Director General, Mark Thompson (Mr Thompson) was appointed in June 2004 and soon embarked on reorganization. Mr Byford, had already been appointed Deputy Director-General in January 2004. Around August 2004, Mr Sambrook was appointed Director of World Service and Global News. Helen Boaden (Ms Boaden) replaced Mr Sambrook as Director of News and Mr Balen began reporting to her. 58. In addition to the Board of Governors and the Executive Board, Mr Thompson set up a newly- formed Journalism Board with Mr Byford as Chairman and Mr Sambrook as a member. Other members included Ms Boaden, Pat Loughrey, Director of Nations & Regions – responsible for all journalism in BBC local news across England and national news within Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and Stephen Whittle, Controller of Editorial Policy. These were all senior managers within the BBC. 59. Mr Whittle described the remit of the Journalism Board in his evidence as follows: “Between us, we were responsible for setting the strategy and values as well as overseeing journalism across all areas of the BBC’s output, including the UK-wide television and radio services, news online, national and regional news programmes, local radio, the World Service and BBC World, the BBC’s international facing commercial channels”. The Balen Report 60. One of the matters considered by the Journalism Board soon after its establishment was the Balen Report. Mr Byford had originally wanted the report discussed at the Board in September 2004. Mr Balen’s report was eventually considered at the 9 November 2004 Journalism Board meeting. From a number of emails in early November 2004, it becomes clear that the report was common knowledge and in circulation amongst the Journalism Board members. In relation to the purpose for which the 21Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Report was being considered by the Board, Mr Balen commented in evidence that “it did go to the Journalism Board as part of a wider strategy review of the Middle East from which several decisions flowed”. 61. Mr Balen was subsequently requested to assist in implementing recommendations made in the report. In evidence to the Tribunal, he explains, “All of these [recommendations] were directed towards improving the BBC’s journalism and programme content”. 62. Immediately following the 9 November 2004 meeting Mr Byford emailed Journalism Board members as follows: “Following our very good discussion at the Journalism Board today on our Middle East coverage and on Malcolm’s report, can I summarise where we are. We will now take forward a number of strands of work which we will then bring together for approval at the Journalism Board as soon as possible in the New Year [late January/early February]… All these strands can be brought together in a paper ‘Taking Forward BBC Coverage of the Middle East’ in January/February, which should be set in the context of the Governors 2004/5 objective: ‘Ensure the BBC meets the highest standards of independence, impartiality and honesty in its journalism and implements recommendations on training, editorial control and complaints handling.’ We are then likely to take forward this amalgam of all our work on the Middle East to Executive Board and Board of Governors in February within this framework, Richard Addy to co- ordinate the overall progress on the strands and the drawing up of this paper”. 63. The Taking Forward paper was eventually presented to the Journalism Board on 9 February 2005. Progress on the implementation of enumerated strands was considered at Board meetings on 17 March 2004, 7 April 2004, 26 May 2005 and 1 November 2005. 64. Mr Balen explained “the initiative stemming from my report” in evidence at the Tribunal hearing as, 22Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 “The establishing of the post of Middle East Editor, reviewing the BBC’s analysis capability, developing a key facts guide, auditing the use of on air Middle East experts and developing BBC training” [Transcript 15th June p 99]. 65. The Tribunal has seen the confidential Taking Forward progress documents and understands that significant changes at the BBC resulted. A very publicized change, for example, is the May 2005 announcement of the recruitment of a Middle East Editor. Jeremy Bowen was appointed to the post in August 2005. Other uses of the Balen Report 66. Around June 2005, Mr Byford commissioned a news gathering strategy paper from Ms Boaden and Mr Sambrook; they used the Balen Report as a source. Mr Sambrook explained the remit of this paper in evidence at the Tribunal hearing: “It was simply another constituent of a broad look at all the BBC’s coverage and casting forward what our future resources would be required in the future, in what was clearly going to be a very major issue in a major region of the world for reporting for years to come. So in this look across the Middle East, we absolutely considered Malcolm’s report, but we also, as I have said earlier, considered the way that the events were developing in Iraq” [Transcript 15th June p58]. 67. Mr Sambrook explained that the Balen Report was “only one element” of a “wider discussion about the Middle East” [Transcript 15th June p59]. . 68. In mid 2005 the BBC Board of Governors appointed Sir Quentin Thomas as chairman of a panel, to undertake an external independent review of BBC reporting in the Middle East. His final document, the “Report of the Independent Panel for the BBC Governors on Impartiality of BBC Coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict” (The Thomas Report), was published in May 2006. 69. Sir Quentin sought a copy of the Balen Report in order to complete his assigned independent analysis of the BBC’s Middle East reporting. On 22 June 2005 Lea Sellers (Ms Sellers) of the BBC 23Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Governance Unit sought access to the Balen Report on behalf of Sir Quentin; Ms Sellers remained unsuccessful through August 2005, as emails presented to the Tribunal show. On 3 November 2005 Sir Quentin requested a copy of the Balen Report from Mr Thompson. A copy was provided on 28 November 2005. Sir Quentin was specifically asked to keep “these management papers” confidential. Ms Boaden commented in an email to Richard Hutt copied to Mr Byford, Mr Balen and Ms Sellers: “I am very happy for Sir Quentin Thomas and his panel to have access to the full Balen Report and any background material associated with it. However, this is conditional on the report remaining confidential to the Impartiality Panel. The report was commissioned from Malcolm Balen by Richard Sambrook on an entirely confidential basis and I do not want the letter or the spirit of that commitment be broken”. 70. In a letter dated 28 November 2005, Mr Byford informed Sir Quentin that the BBC had since established the post of Middle East Editor, reviewed the BBC’s analysis capability, developed a Key Facts Guide, audited the use of experts, and developed training. 71. The Thomas Report mentions Balen twice in the main report, referring to Mr Balen as a “Senior Editorial Adviser”, and noting that Thomas enquiry was supplied with the Balen Report “which was prepared for BBC Management”. In the Thomas Report, the Balen Report is mentioned under the heading of “Earlier Reviews”: “Balen Report: the Panel was given, in response to a request, an unpublished internal report prepared for BBC Management by Senior Editorial Adviser on the Middle East Malcolm Balen in 2003. This was helpful to us but we say no more about it as it was given to us on confidential terms. A number of recommendations have been implemented” 72. As we understand it Mr Balen continues to review the BBC output on a regular basis. Arguments on the meaning of ‘journalism’ 24Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 73. The parties and their representatives made extensive arguments before the Tribunal as to the meaning of “journalism” under FOIA. The main arguments are summarised as follows. 74. Mr Sugar makes a number of submissions on the meaning of journalism. We have attempted to set these out briefly as follows. 75. Firstly he submits that the derogation applies only to journalists’ source material, scripts, recordings and other material collected or created for the direct purpose of making a programme and that the Balen Report does not fall within this class of material. 76. Alternatively he submits that information about editorial questions arising in relation to a programme in preparation may also be covered by the derogation. However, information about editorial matters arising in relation to programmes already transmitted (or to a whole class of programmes to be transmitted) is not within the derogation. He continues that in so far as the Balen Report is information about programmes that had already been transmitted, it is not covered by the derogation. 77. He also argues that journalism should be distinguished from the management of journalism and that, in effect, the latter usually will not be caught by the derogation. He further argues that words for ‘for the purposes of’ in the derogation cannot mean ‘for the direct or indirect purposes of’ and must mean only ‘for the direct purposes of’ say journalism. 78. He submits the purpose of the derogation is to protect BBC journalists from interference with their public watchdog functions as guaranteed by Article 10 of the ECHR and no further. 79. In effect he argues for a narrow definition of ‘journalism’ and that the legislative background supports this contention. 80. In contrast the IC argues that a broader definition of the derogation should be applied. 25Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 81. Mr Nicholls submits that the starting point is to put the derogations, namely journalism, art and literature, in a permissible legal context. In this respect he accepts that both the DPA and the ECHR are relevant, particularly as they relate to freedom of speech. They are the permissible legal background for the Tribunal to take into account, and not the detailed legislative history prescribed by Mr Sugar which he says is excluded under Pepper v Hart. 82. Mr Nicholls maintains that if an extravagantly broad view of the derogation were taken, and because nearly everything that the BBC does is concerned with journalism, art or literature, then it would not be difficult to argue that all information held by the BBC is held for those purposes. He concedes this is too broad a view, and is not the one which the IC puts forward. 83. However he submits that the reason that that extravagant view is not right is that there are two limitations which are implicit in the words of Schedule 1. First, that in order for the BBC not to be treated as a public authority bound by the Act, the information must be directly linked to a journalistic purpose and therefore remote links are insufficient. Secondly, that journalism, must be the dominant purpose for which the information is held. This issue of dominant purpose is dealt with later in this decision. 84. Therefore, he contends, as a matter of law, that you cannot argue that an element of journalism being present in the information held cannot preclude the BBC from being subject to the Act, even if correct as a matter of logic. He continues that journalism is a function or a process of gathering, analysing and conveying news to people. Therefore, prima facie, anything held for the purposes of that function or process is held for the purposes of journalism. 85. In relation to content or output reviews he argues that a review of news which had been broadcast, which is undertaken in order to improve future broadcasting has a direct link to programme content. Therefore, it is not simply a matter of looking retrospectively as Mr Sugar argues. It has ongoing implications of continuous improvement, and is part of the BBC’s Charter obligations. So a link between an output review and programme content is an indication that the information is held for the purposes of journalism. 26Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 86. Mr Nicholls submits it is important to recognize that the concept of journalism, like that of art and literature, is broad. It is not a concept to which it is easy to draw precise boundaries. Mr Sugar argues the derogation only applies to a journalist's sources, scripts, recordings and materials collected for programmes. Mr Nicolls argues that that this contention is wrong for three reasons. Firstly, such a list inevitably gives rise to the hard cases. It makes it difficult to know how to categorize editorial reviews, particularly if they are designed for the purposes of looking at journalism going forward, developing ideas for new programmes, decisions on editorial lines and so forth. These are all matters which, he argues, are self-evidently journalism but may be rather difficult to squeeze into Mr Sugar's restrictive analysis. 87. The second problem, he argues, is that the approach involves rewriting Schedule 1, because it replaces the broad concept of journalism with narrower elements which it is difficult to suggest exhausts the concept of journalism. 88. His third argument is that if the legislature had wanted to go down this prescriptive route, there is a precedent for it to do so. S.10 Contempt of Court Act specifically protects journalist's sources. If the legislature had wanted to protect journalists' sources and the other matters which Mr Sugar has identified, it could have built upon the Contempt of Court Act precedent. It did not do that but used the broader concept of journalism. 89. In relation to the distinction which Mr Sugar sought to draw between journalism and the management of journalism, Mr Nicholls argues that this is not a legitimate distinction and that the management of journalism is an inextricable part of journalism. He contends that you can identify management issues which are not in any way related to journalism, such as, staffing issues, redundancy, pay rises, health and safety matters, environmental and property issues and so forth. However he does not accept as a proposition that where the subject matter in question is journalism that it makes any difference who is involved in the management chain. It does not matter where in the management chain decisions are taken, if they are taken about journalism, even if this extends to the Board of Governors. 27Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 90. This argument, he says, recognizes that the BBC has at its core certain obligations relating to its journalism, for example, the obligation of impartiality. If the Board of Governors were to lay down guidelines to ensure that the BBC adhered to its obligations of impartiality, those would be directly related to its journalism. Mr Asielue referred in the Provisional Decision to carving out a creative and journalistic space in which the BBC could exercise its rights of free speech, without public interference. This can also apply to management activity. 91. Ms Carrs-Frisk argues that the terms “journalism, art and literature” are very broad and not defined in FOIA. The most obvious source of these words is in the DPA where the so called “special purposes” in s.3 use the same words and like FOIA the DPA contains no definition of the words. 92. This means, she argues, that one must give the words their plain and ordinary meaning, whilst bearing in mind what appears to have been the statutory purpose behind their use, namely to protect freedom of expression and the rights of the media under Article 10 of ECHR and so as not to place PSBs at an unfair advantage compared to their commercial rivals. 93. On this basis she continues the IC was correct to conclude in the Provisional Decision that journalism includes “all types of output which the BBC produces and broadcasts”. She maintains that the word includes not only journalistic output or content or product or expression but also the activity of journalism. The Tribunal’s finding on the meaning of “journalism” 94. The Tribunal wishes to give “journalism” its natural meaning as intended by Parliament. We need to do this so that we can decide this appeal, and if possible provide guidance to PSBs, those requesting information from them and the IC in relation to the scope of this part of the derogation. We recognise that the derogation was largely introduced in order to protect freedom of expression as espoused by Article 10 ECHR. 95. FOIA includes the BBC “in respect of information held for purposes other than journalism, art or literature”. The Tribunal has to determine two matters concerning this limited application of FOIA to 28Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 the BBC. The first is what does “journalism” mean for the purposes of the Act. The second is whether, on the date on which Mr Sugar made his request, the Balen Report was held for the purposes of journalism or for some other purpose. We have set out above the main arguments of the parties on the first matter and a considerable amount of evidence and background information relating to both matters. 96. On a broad definition, it could be argued that all of the activities of the BBC are for the purposes of journalism, art and literature, as these are broad descriptions of a substantial part of its broadcast output. This is the position taken by some of the BBC’s witnesses including Mr Sambrook. 97. The BBC agrees that the words “journalism, art, or literature” should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. Mr Sambrook in evidence as to what this means starts off by saying: “I think I would characterise ""journalism"" as the process or discipline of collecting, verifying, analysing and presenting information about current events or issues.” [Transcript June 15, p. 80 lines 7-18] 98. This would appear to provide for a fairly narrow definition of journalism. However, Ms Francesca Unsworth (Head of News Gathering for BBC News) in evidence considered that the decision to create a new post of Middle East Editor was part of journalism and that you “cannot divide the managerial function from the journalistic function” in relation to the appointment [Transcript June 14 p. 135 lines 10-16]: 99. Mr Sambrook expressed the same view, despite his earlier statement [Transcript June 15, pp.48-49, lines 19-25, 1-23] “I think the difficulty is in the BBC -- if I can just make a general point first -- is that actually unlike newspapers which are generally organised where you have an editor and a managing director and the editorial and management functions are separated to quite a senior level, that is not the case in the BBC. From programme editor upwards, journalistic and managerial functions are mixed. … There are clearly issues which are purely journalistic and some issues that are purely managerial. … most of the decisions 29Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 that are taken there are driven journalistically because in the end, our business is about broadcast news and broadcast journalism, …[Transcript June 15, pp.78-79, lines 19-25, 1-7] 100. Later he said in evidence “I think one of the recurring themes of this tribunal is that I think it is very difficult to separate management and journalism as cleanly as that. And questions about how you make those selections, the resources that are available to you to make selections, might be characterised on the one hand as management, but they are absolutely core to journalism and determine both the quality, the nature and the character of journalism.” [ Transcript June 15 pp. 82-83, lines 14-25, 1-2] 101. It would appear from this evidence that the BBC believes that the ordinary meaning of journalism is such that it permeates all levels of management to the extent that the largest part of what is done by that management is journalism and therefore covered by the derogation. This would have the effect of excluding most of the BBC’s management information from the remit of FOIA. 102. However, if a very broad definition was intended, there would be little point in including the BBC in Schedule 1, Part VI of FOIA. The BBC could have been omitted altogether from the scope of the Act. 103. On a narrow definition, journalism might be limited to the generation of specific journalistic output, that is, material that is published or broadcast. If that view is taken, protection of materials prior to broadcast could be covered by the FOIA exemption in s.22 (information intended for future publication), protection of journalistic sources could be covered by the exemption in s.41 (information provided in confidence), information of interest to commercial competitors could be covered by the exemption in s.43 (commercial interests) and internal editorial reviews could be covered by s.36 (prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs). If a very narrow definition was intended, provision for a limited application of FOIA to the BBC would not have been required. 30Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 104. It was argued before the Tribunal that a line should be drawn between journalism and the management of journalism. The Tribunal does not find this a helpful distinction, nor is it one that is capable of reasonably precise definition. “Management” can be exercised at many levels. The management of a front-line journalist by a more senior journalist is, arguably, directly for the purpose of journalism. Management at a strategic or directing level may have an impact on journalism but is, arguably, too remote from the journalistic function to be said to be for the purpose of journalism, as opposed to the overall direction of the organisation. 105. Having considered all the evidence and arguments we find a more useful distinction may be between functional journalism, and the direction of policy, strategy and resources that provide the framework within which the operations of a PSB take place. 106. In relation to functional journalism we find that it covers collecting or gathering, writing, editing and presenting material for publication, and reviewing that material. In order to further understand functional journalism the Tribunal considers the following three elements constitute functional journalism. 107. The first is the collecting or gathering, writing and verifying of materials for publication. 108. The second is editorial. This involves the exercise of judgement on issues such as: • the selection, prioritisation and timing of matters for broadcast or publication, • the analysis of, and review of individual programmes, • the provision of context and background to such programmes. 109. The third is the maintenance and enhancement of the standards and quality of journalism (particularly with respect to accuracy, balance and completeness). This may involve the training and development of individual journalists, the mentoring of less experienced journalists by more experienced colleagues, professional supervision and guidance, and reviews of the standards and quality of particular areas of programme making. 31Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 110. In the Provisional Decision Mr Asielue, described the derogation as protecting “journalistic, artistic and literary integrity by carving out a creative and journalistic space for programme makers to produce programmes free from the interference and scrutiny of the public”. The Tribunal accepts the argument that the derogation was intended to establish a “journalistic space”, but considers some closer understanding of that space is required. The three elements described above of collecting or gathering, editing and quality assuring material for journalistic output appear to the Tribunal to be the ordinary meaning of “journalism” which makes sense of the derogation. 111. We note that our approach is consistent with that set out in the HO Letter, referred to above, although we do not rely on the letter as supporting our view. It will be recalled that the letter was intended to assist DCMS in answering a request for information from a Japanese broadcaster regarding the treatment of PSBs under the (then) Freedom of Information Bill. Stephen Earl (Mr Earl), from the Freedom of Information Unit of the Home Office, said that the Government had sought not to place the PSBs “at an unfair disadvantage to their commercial rivals”, hence the decision to limit the application of the legislation to information other than that held for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes. 112. Similarly we note that our approach is consistent with Mr Earl’s view that: “The intention behind this limitation is to protect the resource constituted by information gathered by the public service broadcasters for the purpose of programme making.” Mr Earl’s letter clarified also those matters not intended to be covered by what became the derogation. He said: “Information held by the public service broadcasters in relation to their operation, administration, management, policies etc is covered by the Bill.” However we do not rely on Mr Earl’s view. 113. The Tribunal accepts that “information gathered … for the purpose of programme making” is a reasonable starting point for a definition of what falls within the “creative and journalistic space” referred to in the Provisional Decision. The Tribunal considers it self-evident that the news gathering and editorial functions (the first two legs of the Tribunal’s definition set out above) fall within the “journalistic space” and constitute a part of the “information gathered … for the purpose of programme making”. Some further consideration of the third, quality assurance leg is required, as this is of particular relevance to the nature of the Balen Report. 32Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 114. It makes sense to us that an integral part of programme making is striving continuously to improve performance, and that measures are in place to assure and enhance quality. This is why the Tribunal includes within the ordinary meaning of journalism the third leg relating to quality assurance. 115. As stated earlier in this decision, the Tribunal was informed in the evidence of Mr Sambrook that ‘output reviews’ were undertaken of areas of the BBC’s broadcasting. These were said to enable senior journalists to reflect on the quality and balance of output. Mr Sambrook told the Tribunal that such reviews were a “primary means of influencing journalism”. In his evidence, Mr Balen told the Tribunal that he regarded his report as being very much of the nature of an ‘output review’. The Tribunal has had the benefit of reading the Balen Report, and the nature of the bulk of the material contained within it is consistent with Mr Balen’s description. 116. Self-critical review and analysis of output is a necessary part of safeguarding and enhancing quality. The necessary frankness of such internal analysis would be damaged if it were to be written in an anodyne fashion, as would be likely to be the case if it were potentially disclosable to a rival broadcaster. 117. In our view, output reviews, including the bulk of the material in the Balen Report, are produced for the purposes of journalism, and will be generally within the scope of the derogation. As such, if held solely for that purpose, they would be outside the remit of FOIA. However, it is possible that some information may be held by the BBC for more than one purpose, and may be held for different purposes at different times. Multiple purposes 118. What happens if the information the subject of a request is held by the BBC for both journalistic and non-journalistic, art and literature purposes? Clearly many requests will cover a number of purposes, in and outside the derogation. 33Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 119. Mr Sugar submits that the wording of the derogation is clear. It includes within the Act information held by the BBC for purposes other than those of journalism. If information is held for a non-journalistic purpose it is held for a purpose other than the purposes of journalism. As a matter of language, it is simply irrelevant that the information is also held for a journalistic purpose. 120. He argues the derogation could have been expressed so as to exclude from the Act information held by the BBC for the purposes of journalism whether or not it was also held for a non-journalistic purpose. The language which would have expressed this would have been to define the BBC as a public authority ‘in respect of information not held for the purposes of journalism etc’. On this wording, if information was held for the purposes of journalism, it would be outside the Act whether or not it was also held for other purposes. 121. He submits that as a matter of language if information is held for a non-journalistic purpose then it is within the scope of the Act. It is simply irrelevant that it may also be held for a journalistic purpose. 122. Ms Carrs-Frisk on behalf of the BBC argues that information may often be held for more than one purpose, and the purposes may vary in significance. But the intention behind the designation (as she refers to the derogation) of the BBC in Schedule 1 to FOIA is plainly to draw a dividing line between information which is and is not subject to FOIA. This suggests that the derogation should be interpreted either so that the BBC is a public authority in relation to information which is exclusively held for purposes other than journalism, etc (“non-journalistic purposes”), or so that the BBC is a public authority where the dominant (albeit not necessarily exclusive) purpose for which it is held is non-journalistic. 123. She continues it is clearly arguable that exclusivity is the test. However she submits that the most sensible approach (which Parliament is likely to have intended) is to consider whether the dominant purpose of holding the information is non-journalistic. Another way of posing the same question is to ask whether the information is predominantly held for non-journalistic, or journalistic, purposes. This approach is consistent with the test applied by the Courts in considering whether a 34Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 document created for multiple purposes is covered by litigation privilege (see Waugh v British Railways Board [1980] AC 521). 124. The Tribunal agrees that the dominant purpose test is the test that Parliament is likely to have intended. However we find that there is a difference between a dominant purpose test in relation to the “creation” of a document, as in Waugh, and a dominant purpose test in relation to the “holding” of the document which is the criterion under FOIA. Clearly whereas the purpose(s) for which a document is created is set in time, the purposes for which a document is held can change over time. Therefore the application of a dominant purpose test under FOIA will relate to the purpose(s) for which the information was held at the time the request was received by the public authority and not at the time the information was created. 125. A document that is primarily an output review may be held for more than one purpose. Such a review might disclose a weakness in news gathering. If the review was a factor taken into account by an editor in deciding to run a story from an area of news gathering strength, rather than one from an area of relative weakness, that in our view would be a purely journalistic decision, and the information would be held for the purposes of journalism. However, if the review was used to support a case for additional financial or staffing resources to enable the weakness to be corrected, or to make a case for additional resources to be allocated to one area rather than another, it would then be held for other purposes and would lie outside the derogation. 126. At the highest level, the BBC Governors exercise responsibilities laid upon them by the Charter. The Tribunal was told that the objectives of the Governors for the period in question (2004/5) included ensuring that the BBC meets the highest standards of independence, impartiality and honesty in its journalism. It is easy to see that the content of an output review particularly if it contained suggestions or recommendations dealing with these standards, as the Balen Report does, could assist the Governors in the discharge of that responsibility. If an output review was to be used in that way, then in our view it would be held for the purpose of governance, in addition to any other purpose for which it might be held. 35Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 127. In his evidence, Mr Sambrook said that he had engaged Mr Balen because he “wanted a private, informal view of our journalism from someone whose judgement I trusted”. Had the matter ended there, the Tribunal would have had little difficulty in concluding that Mr Balen’s work was “journalistic” under the definition provided above. 128. However, the matter did not end there. Mr Balen wrote his work up as a formal report entitled “Reporting the Middle East” which was submitted to the BBC’s Journalism Board as paper JB(04) 40 on 9th November 2004. The Journalism Board, as we have already established, is a very senior body within the BBC, chaired by the Deputy Director General. The functions of the Journalism Board were described to the Tribunal by Mr Whittle. 129. He described the work of his Department as including the production of editorial guidelines for the BBC as a whole. The Tribunal was told that the guidelines include provisions on bias, accuracy, impartiality and other issues relating to programme standards and journalistic integrity. A current version of the guidelines was “approved for publication by the Board of Governors” in April 2005. This approval by the Governors is a clear indication that the document, and related policy work at this level, related as much to the discharge by the Governors of their responsibilities under the Charter as to the purposes of functional journalism. 130. Against this background, Mr Whittle described the establishment of the Journalism Board by the Director General in 2004. It consisted of those senior executives who “were responsible for setting the strategy and values as well as overseeing journalism across all areas of the BBC’s output”. The Tribunal considers that these oversight and strategic responsibilities are not within the “creative and journalistic space” that is protected by the derogation. Furthermore, they have a clear relationship to the exercise of the overall responsibilities of the Governors. 131. Mr Whittle’s evidence records the consideration by the Journalism Board of the Balen Report. He said “The review itself was relevant to the strategic editorial oversight of programme making the Board was expected to have. It enabled the Board to consider what improvements if any it needed to make to the BBC’s coverage.” He went on to say: “The report also stimulated the Board into 36Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 commissioning additional journalistic tools to assist in coverage of the area to have an impact on the way that news editors treated a story.” 132. Mr Whittle regarded the Balen Report as having been prepared for the purposes of BBC journalism. The Tribunal considers that when the Report was considered by the Journalism Board, the purposes it supported were of a policy and strategic nature, related to the overall allocation of resources, and to the discharge by the Governors, through the senior executives of the BBC, of their Charter responsibilities. 133. The Tribunal is clear that, when originally commissioned, Mr Balen’s work was for predominantly journalistic purposes. It formed a part of the third leg of the meaning of journalism that the Tribunal has adopted, in that it was primarily an output review intended to assure and enhance quality. However, when elevated to the Journalism Board on 9th November 2004, as a formal report, it was being used for, and hence was held for, wider purposes of strategic policy and resource allocation, which lie outside the scope of the derogation. 134. There were significant consequences arising from the consideration by the Journalism Board of the Balen Report, not least the allocation of resources to appoint a Middle East Editor, in the person of Mr Jeremy Bowen. In Mr Byford’s letter to Sir Quentin Thomas of 28 November 2005 he stated that: “The initiatives have included establishing the post of Middle East Editor; reviewing our analysis capability; developing a Key Facts guide; auditing the use of on air ‘Middle East experts’; developing our training.” 135. The seniority of the Journalism Board, and the strategic and resource consequences of its consideration of the Report, lead the Tribunal to the view that, from 9th November 2004 the dominant purpose for which the information was held lay outside the scope of the derogation. 37Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Tribunal’s findings 136. The Tribunal finds that at the date the request was received by the BBC the dominant purpose for which the Balen Report was held was for purposes other than those of journalism, art and literature. Mr Sugar made his request for information on 8th January 2005. At that date the dominant purpose for which the information was held lay outside the derogation. The BBC was wrong to rely on the derogation in refusing to provide information and the IC was wrong to uphold that decision. 137. Our finding in relation to the derogation is supported by the fact that the BBC has available to it a number of exemptions under FOIA to enable it to further protect its commercial position in relation to private media rivals, in addition to the derogation. These exemptions are principally set out in paragraph 103 above. 138. Our finding means that the request was a valid request under s.1 FOIA and the Balen Report was held for a purpose within the remit of FOIA. This decides the second preliminary issue in this case. 139. The Tribunal invites submissions from the parties on how Mr Sugar’s request should now be dealt with following this decision. The Tribunal considers there may be several possible options. Clearly, the effect of the Tribunal’s decision is that the BBC should now consider the request under the provisions of Parts I to IV of FOIA. The BBC might then send Mr Sugar a copy of the Balen Report, or issue a refusal notice under s.17 FOIA, or provide Mr Sugar with a redacted version of the Balen Report and issue a refusal notice in relation to the redacted parts. If the BBC issues a refusal notice then what is the process by which any exemptions claimed can be challenged by Mr Sugar? Should such challenge be considered by the IC in the first instance or dealt with by the Tribunal at a full hearing of this appeal? What time limits should be applied to this exercise? 140. The Tribunal invites the parties to provide written submissions to the Tribunal as to how the matter should be dealt with from here onwards, within 20 days of the date of this decision, and to indicate whether there is agreement between the parties or some of them as to the way forward. Also the parties should indicate whether they are content for the Tribunal to decide on the next steps based on their written submissions or would wish to present the submissions to the Tribunal at a hearing convened for the purpose. 38Appeal number: EA/2005/0032 Signed Date 29th August 2006 John Angel Chairman 39"
"91","Substantive Refusal","IN THE INFORMATION TRIBUNAL (NATIONAL SECURITY APPEALS PANEL) BETWEEN - PETER HITCHENS Appellant -AND- SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent DECISION 1. We were appointed members of the Data Protection Tribunal (now renamed the Information Tribunal) under section 6(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”) and designated by the Lord Chancellor to hear national security appeals pursuant to Schedule 6 paragraph 2(1). This appeal was brought by Peter Hitchens (“the Appellant”) under section 28(4) of the Act. Jurisdiction 2. The Security Service (“the Service” is a data controller who processes personal data within the scope of the Act. “Processes includes “holds” (section 1(1)). Section 7 of the Act requires data controllers to respond to requests made by individuals for information as to whether their personal data are being processed (section 7(1)(a)) and, if they are, to have them described and communicated to them (section 7(1)(b-c)). 3. By section 28, personal data are exempt from these, and other, provisions of the Act “if the exemption from that provision is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security” (section 28(1)). 4. When a data controller fails to comply with a request made in accordance with the Act, the individual may apply to the Court for an order that he shall comply with therequest (section 7(9)). An application to the Court, in a case where the data controller relies upon the national security exemption, is regulated by further provisions of section 28. By section 28(2), “a certificate signed by a Minister of the Crown certifying that exemption ……… is or at any time was required for the purpose there mentioned in respect of any personal data shall be conclusive evidence of that fact”. 5. An individual who is “directly affected” by the Minister’s Certificate may challenge it by appealing to this panel of the Information Tribunal, under section 28(4) of the Act. The powers of the Tribunal on such an appeal are set out in section 28(5) – “(5) If on an appeal under subsection (4), the Tribunal finds that, applying the principles applied by the court on an application for judicial review, the Minister did not have reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate, the Tribunal may allow the appeal and quash the certificate.” 6. A second branch of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in national security cases, under section 28(6) of the Act, is not relevant to its jurisdiction in this appeal. Background 7. By its Decision in Baker v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1 October 2001, reported in [2001] UKHRR 1275], the Tribunal quashed a Certificate issued by the Respondent dated 22 July 2000 relating to personal data processed by the Security Service. 8. The Respondent issued a revised form of Certificate relating to personal data processed by the Service, dated 10 December 2001 (hereinafter “the Certificate”). 9. The Appellant challenges the validity of the Certificate by this appeal under section 28(4) of the Act (paragraph 5 above). Facts 10. By letter dated 16 January 2002 the Appellant made a formal request “under the Data Protection Act 1998, Section Seven, to a) ask if the Security Service processes data about me and b) to ask to see such data as soon as may be arranged”. 11. The Service replied by letter dated 24 January 2002 enclosing an Application Form, which the Appellant completed and returned on 1 February 2002. He stated that he was born on 28 October 1951 and gave his place of birth (Sliema, Malta GC) and his current and previous addresses, as required by the Form. In response to the question – “DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA THAT YOU BELIEVE WE MAY HOLD ON YOU” he replied –“1970 – 1975 ACTIVITY AS MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISTS, MAINLY IN YORK 1970-73”. 12. The Service replied by letter dated 03 April 2002 that it holds no data about the Appellant in any of the three categories which it has notified to the Information Commissioner (these are staff administration, building security CCTV and commercial agreements), and continued “3. Any other personal data held by the Security Service is exempt from the notification and subject access provisions of [the Act] to the extent that such exemption is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security, as provided for in section 28(1) of the Act. It has been determined that the Security Service holds no personal data to which you are entitled to have access. This response should not be taken to imply that the Security Service does or does not hold any data about you.” 14. This was a form of the non-committal NCND (“neither confirm nor deny”) response, the validity of which, in appropriate cases, was not challenged in the Baker appeal, nor is it challenged by the Appellant in this appeal (see paragraph 33 below). 15. The letter concluded “Yours sincerely ……………..For Data Controller” and was subscribed only by a manuscript “squiggle” which could not be described as a signature. The Appeal 16. The Appellant gave notice of appeal by letter dated 19 June 2002. He is a journalist, and his grounds of appeal should be quoted in full – “My request was for files held on my activities as an extreme left-wing student in the early 1970s, mainly while I was at the University of York between 1970 and 1973. As it happens I think it would have been quite legitimate for the Security Service to keep an eye on the organisation to which I then belonged, a Marxist grouplet called the International Socialists. I already have a fair idea who its informants were in our organisation, and have no intention of disclosing their identity or publicising it. My aim is purely to know what, if anything, is in these records, mainly because I feel I am entitled to know the details of such records as a matter of natural justice. Since I am no longer a revolutionary Marxist, and the politics of this country have been utterly transformed in the intervening period, and it is most unlikely that any individual mentioned in these files still holds a sensitive position of any kind, I can see no argument for withholding these files from me. I would, if asked, be quite happy to co-operate with the Security Service to ensure that no sensitive information was accidentally disclosed. Theirresponse, however, is simple blank refusal …… covered by the meaningless and hard-to-justify claim that this is “safeguarding national security”. I think the Security Service needs to do better than this to justify secrecy over files almost 30 years old concerning my own youthful follies and their attempts to monitor them.” 17. The Respondent’s Notice included “A. Summary of circumstances relating to the issue of the certificate and the reasons for doing so” and a copy of the Certificate dated 10 December 2001. Also annexed was the document referenced DPA/S28/TSS/2- REASONS referred to in the Certificate, paragraph 2. The Respondent’s grounds were stated as follows – “11. The Appellant challenges the “neither confirm nor deny” policy itself. The Security Service’s exemption from section 7(1)(a) of [the Act] exists in order to allow it to operate that policy. The reasonableness and lawfulness in general of the “neither confirm nor deny” policy, and the lawfulness in general of a certificate permitting the operation of that policy, was upheld in [Baker v SSHD]. This point is a mere attempt to reargue this. 12. Further or in the alternative, the Respondent submits that he had reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate, which are outlined in the Reasons Document (Annex C).” 18. The Appellant wrote to the Tribunal Secretary amplifying his grounds of appeal, by letter dated 10 September 2002. He made three main points – (1) the terms letter from the Service to him dated 3 April 2002 was in almost identical terms to those of the letter to Norman Baker MP dated 11 August 2000. “Spot the difference. One letter was written BEFORE the quashing of the Home Secretary’s certificate dated July 22, 2000…….the second was written AFTER that decision….we might expect to see a substantive difference in the Security Service’s response to request made before and after this event. However, the two letters merely say the same thing in a different way.” The only difference was that the Service claimed, in the letter to him to have given individual consideration to his particular request, not relying merely on a blanket exemption as it had don in the early case; (2) his individual circumstances are such that there can be no possible damage to national security in either acknowledging the existence of any files held onhim, or stating that no files exist, or in letting him examine those files under certain conditions; and (3) he has strong anecdotal reasons to believe that some such files do exist. 19. The Respondent informed the Tribunal that he did not intend to lodge any Amended response to this letter. The Certificate and Reasons 20. These documents are annexed to this Decision. Passages of particular relevance to the parties’ submissions can be summarised as follows – Certificate Personal data processing in performance of the functions of the Security Service described in Section 1 of the Security Service Act 1989 as amended by the Security Service Act 1990 is exempted from inter alia section 7 of the Act, “all for the purpose of safeguarding national security, provided that: “(I) no data shall be exempt from the provisions of section 7(1)(a) …… if the Security Service, after considering any request by a data subject for access to relevant personal data, determines that adherence to the principle of neither confirming nor denying whether the Security Service holds data about an individual is not required for the purpose of safeguarding national security; (ii) no data shall be exempt from the provisions of section 7(1)(b) (c) or (d) …..if the Security Service, after considering any request by a data subject for access to relevant personal data, determines that non-communication of such data or any description of such data is not required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.” The exemption does not include the fourth data protection principle (“Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date” – Schedule 1 part 1 para. 4 of the Act). The Reasons The Reasons are summarised in the Certificate, as follows – “2.1 The work of the security and intelligence agencies of the Crown requires secrecy. 2.2 The general principle of neither confirming nor denying whether the Security Service possesses data about an individual …………… is an essential part of that secrecy.2.3 In dealing with subject access requests under [the Act], the Security Service will examine each individual request to determine: (i) whether adherence to that general principle is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security; and (ii) in the event that such adherence is not required, whether to and to what extent the non-communication of any data or any description of data is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 2.4 ………………………………………………………………………” The Reasons also include the following – “5. The need for and use of the “neither confirm nor deny” policy 5.1 ……….Put simply, the policy is a way to preserve the secrecy described above by giving a vague and non-committal answer. 5.3 ……….To ask whether the Security Service holds personal data on an individual often amounts to asking whether there is or has been an investigation. 5.4 ……….By logical extension, the policy must apply even if no investigation has taken place. If the Security Service said when it did not hold information on a particular person, inevitably over time those on whom it did not hold information would be able incrementally to deduce that fact…………… 5.5 If individuals intent on damaging national security could confirm that they were not the subjects of interest to the Security Service, then they could undertake their activities with increased confidence and vigour………… 5.6 Conversely, confirmation to individuals that they are subjects of interest may create or fuel suspicions that associates of theirs are assisting the Security Service…….” 6. The safeguards and statutory controls that exist on the activities of the Security Service 6.1.1 Legal constraints placed on the Security Service and its work ….. by Parliament through: iii The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This law governs the interception of communications, thecarrying out of surveillance and the use of “covert human intelligence sources” eg undercover officers or agents. 6.1.9 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 also set up the Investigatory Powers Tribunal…… 7. Non-Data-Protection-Act Remedies 7.1 Anyone who feels aggrieved by anything which he or she believes the Security Service has done in relation to them or their property may complain to the independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal………………There is no bar to what Tribunal members can see when looking into a complaint………………” 8. The test that should be used to balance the need to safeguard national security and purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 8.2…….the Home Secretary has balanced the need to safeguard natinal security against the purposes and entitlements conferred by the DPA………………..” Evidence 21. The Respondent relied on (1) a Witness Statement by A J Tester, a civil servant of the Home Office; he produced a Witness Statement, with enclosures, that he made in connection with the Baker appeal, and confirmed that the Security Service asked the Home Secretary to sign a new certificate “whose terms took account of that decision”: and (2) two statements by an unnamed Security Service witness, who described the operational duties and needs of the Service and justified the “neither confirm nor deny” policy adopted by it. He also produced evidence of corresponding laws and practices in other jurisdictions. Public Hearing 22. The hearing of the appeal to place on Tuesday 4 March 2003. At the Appellant’s request, and with the Respondent’s consent, the Tribunal directed that the hearing should take place in public, pursuant to rule 23(1) of The Data Protection Tribunal (National Security Appeals) Rules 2000. An application by the Appellant that he should have leave to tape record the hearing was refused, but Court Reporters produced a transcript in the usual way.Submissions 23. The Appellant spoke to a written Submission in which he amplified the argument set out in his appeal letter (paragraph 16 above). He stated that his object was to view, under whatever conditions were regarded as sensible, the Security Service files relating to him when he was at University, files which he was certain existed. He was an extreme left-wing student and would be disappointed if he was not under surveillance at that time. Even the identities of the officers and agents involved were fairly obvious, and he approved of what they were doing. He challenged the Respondent to explain how the national security could be imperilled, today, by confirming to him that a 30-year old file recording his activities then does exist. 24. He referred to a recent newspaper report that Cabinet documents were released on 1 January 2003 under the “30-year rule” which stated that the Prime Minister in 1972, Edward Heath, asked the Security Service to “spy on school agitators” at a time when certain persons were suspected of fomenting student unrest; one of the suspected persons was named in the report. If this could be published now, he asked, how could the national security be harmed by revealing whether he was under surveillance, as he believed that he was, at about the same time? 25. He added that his political outlook now is diametrically different from the Marxist views he held at University. “There is no continuity………..I’m a conservative journalist, not a student Marxist.” 26. As for the Respondent’s arguments that responding to his request might reveal methods of surveillance which ought to be kept secret in the interest of national security, he answered in terms of a dilemma: either the methods were traditional and timeless, so that no harm could result from revealing what they were, or they were technical, in which case the techniques must certainly be outdated. 27. He related his own position to that of his contemporaries who occupy high offices of state in the present government, and he referred to questions asked in Parliament as to whether the Security Service has records of surveillance carried out on them about thirty years ago. 28. He recognised that the issues for this Tribunal is whether to Respondent’s Certificate is valid, but he contended that the Security Service could not be relied upon to exercise the power delegated to it by the Respondent reasonably. His case demonstrated, he submitted, that the position is no different under the new (10.12.01) Certificate fromwhat it was under its predecessor, which the Tribunal quashed in Baker. For the same reasons, this Certificate ought to be quashed also. 29. Mr Robin Tam, counsel for the Respondent, reminded us that we were concerned only with the validity of the Certificate, not with its application or operation in the individual case. He submitted that the Appellant’s complaints should be taken to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal which, as the Respondent had accepted in correspondence following the Gosling appeal, has jurisdiction to entertain them. 30. Members of the Tribunal referred to the fact that when broad discretionary powers are delegated it is often the case that rules or guidelines are established which are binding on the delegatee. This tends to promote greater transparency and permits a more effective review of his decisions. Mr Tam submitted that it would not be possible to lay down guidelines based on the age of a file, and that detailed criteria are unnecessary and would be inappropriate. Certain guidelines have been agreed, it appears, between the Service and the Public Records Office regarding the destruction of records which the Service no longer requires, but in the present context the test of harm to national security “is precise enough and one cannot really do much more than that”. 31. He further submitted that, as the Service is the relevant data controller, delegating the responsibility for responding the requests for information to him was I accordance with the requirements of the Act, and he returned to his principal submission, that any complaint about individual decisions made by the Service should properly be taken to the IPT. 32. In summary, the Service is in the best position to judge what national security requires, and the correct approach in law is to entrust decision of this sort to them: Rehman v SSHD [2001] 3 WLR 877. Mr Tam also referred to us the decision of Mr Justice David in Ewing (20 December 2002 unreported). 33. In reply, the Appellant submitted (1) that it had not been suggested to him previously that he should take his complaint to the IPT; (2) he does not challenge the policy of NCND replies generally, but only its application to the present case where the relevant events, as he sees them, took place 30 years ago, they are no longer of any political relevance, and there are no grounds for suggesting that he has done anything since then which might call for surveillance by the Service; and (3) that the release of Cabinet papers (paragraph 24 above) was inconsistent with the Service’s reliance on the national security exemption in the present case.34. We are grateful both to the Appellant and to Mr Tam for their concise and helpful submissions. Discussion 35. Mr Tam is correct in his submission that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 28(4) of the Act is limited to determining whether the respondent had reasonable grounds for issuing the Certificate dated 10 December 2001. We are not directly concerned with the issue whether the Security Services’ response to the Appellant’s request was justified in this particular case. 36. This does not mean, however, that the facts of the case are not relevant to the issue under section 28(4). The Appellant’s underlying submission is that a certificate which enables the Security Services to invoke “national security” in a case where that claim is manifestly unreasonable and excessive, as he says that it is in his case, cannot be said to have been issued on reasonable grounds. The result, he says, is absurd, and the Certificate which permits it must be regarded as unreasonable. 37. We can focus this submission on the situation which arises when the national security exemption is relied upon in relation to a request under section 7(1)(a) of the Act, and the NCND reply is given. Among the Respondent’s published Reasons is the following broad statement – “If the Security Service said when it did not hold information on a particular person inevitably over time those on whom it did hold information would be able incrementally to deduce that fact.” (paragraph 5.4). 38. The Reasons also confirm that this approach is used to justify a non-committal answer, except when the fact that the Services hold relevant data has already been published, or when the Services themselves are willing to acknowledge it – “5.7 There are circumstances when the neither confirm nor deny policy is not used. Usually when it has been officially confirmed that the Security Service had undertaken an investigation, for example when a terrorist has been prosecuted, or when the interests of national security require a disclosure.” 39. The Appellant therefore is justified in his comment that in practice the revised form of Certificate is likely to have exactly the same effect as the original form which the Tribunal quashed in Baker. Although the revised form requires an exercise of discretion by the Security Services in every case, it permits the NCND reply even in a case where a definite response to a particular request would not itself be directly harmful to nationalsecurity, because of the possible inference that might then be drawn in other cases where the NCND reply was given. 40. We find it difficult to accept that the NCND reply can always be justified on this ground, because of a matter of commonsense it may be thought that there are some cases where a definite response would not enable any inference to be drawn in other cases. The Appellant’s case at first sight could be an example of this, if his belief that he cannot have been the subject of surveillance or data processing by the Secret Services during the past thirty years is correct. But even this example shows how readily an inference might be drawn. If he and a university contemporary both made requests under section 7(1)(a) for records which, if they exist, are more than thirty years old, a NCND reply in one case but not the other might suggest that more recent data are held in that case alone. This would be so, even if NCND replies were given in both cases regarding more recent data. 41. However, despite our intuitive view, we have not been able to formulate any definition of those cases, possibly rare, where a definite reply could be given, as a general rule, without a potential risk to national security by reason of inferences which might be drawn in other cases. It seems inevitable that the decision in individual cases must be left to the Security Services themselves. The question is whether the Respondent had reasonable grounds for issuing the Certificate in a form which leaves the assessment of “national security” entirely to them. 42. It has not been argued in this or in the related appeal by Tony Gosling that the Respondent was required by the Act to make this decision himself in every case, or to put it another way, that he was not entitled to delegate the power of decision making to the data controller concerned, though Mr Gosling came close to this when he submitted that it ought not to be delegated to the Security Services, who become ‘judge and jury in their own cause’. He contended that the decision should be entrusted to some “independent adjudicator”, whom understandably he could not identify more precisely. But we remind ourselves that we have to interpret and apply the Act as it stands, and it is no part of our function to consider what other and possibly better scheme Parliament might have established. 43. On the other hand, we also reject Mr Tam’s submission that delegating the power to decide whether an exemption applies to the data controller is consistent with other provisions of the Act, specifically section 7(4). There, the data controller’s decision is subject to review by the Court (section 7(9). The issue raised by this appeal is whetherthe Respondent had reasonable grounds for delegating the power to the Security Services when they were the data controller in question, and there is no corresponding provision for an appeal or review. 44. This leads to the question whether, if the Certificate is valid, such decisions made by the Security Services are subject to control and supervision under the Act. This Tribunal has no power to review individual cases under section 28(4) (paragraph 35 above). Its jurisdiction under section 28(6) is not relevant where a NCND reply is given to a request under section 7(1)(a) of the Act, because by definition no personal data are identified. An application to the Court under section 28(9) would be met by the Certificate, which would stand as conclusive evidence under section 28(2). The only possible course for the applicant would be to bring proceedings against the Security Services for judicial review of their decision in the particular case. It seems unlikely that Parliament intended this in a case where national security considerations arise, having regard to the fact that this Tribunal was created for such cases under section 28. However, the limited scope of section 28 may have that possibly unintended effect. 45. It is in these circumstances that the Respondent places much reliance on the fact that the Security Services are subject to supervision and control by state agencies and bodies other than the Courts. He refers in particular to the Investigatory Power Tribunal (“IPT”) established by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. For the reasons given in our Decision in Mr Gosling’s appeal, we hold that – (1) the jurisdiction of the IPT is defined widely enough to include a complaint that the Security Services were not justified in claiming that a NCND response was necessary to safeguard national security in the particular case (though we are doubtful whether Parliament intended that it should routinely decide matters of this sort); and (2) delegating to the Security Services the power of deciding these issues of national security is lawful and consistent with decisions of English and European Courts. Relevant pages of the Gosling Appeal Decision are attached hereto as Annex A. 46. The Tribunal has also considered whether the Certificate ought reasonably to include express restrictions on the exercise of the power delegated to officials in the Security Service. Among the possibilities are –(1) express guidelines as to what factors are relevant and should be taken into account by the decision-maker; (2) a requirement that the decision shall be made by an official of certain seniority; (3) the Certificate might contain an expanded definition of “national security”; and (4) the Certificate might be worded so that there is a presumption against using the NCND reply, rather than expressing it s a proviso to an instruction that generally does apply. 47. We do not regard either (2) or (3) as practicable or useful, and in relation to (3) we should add that we have been unable to find any judicial definition of “national security”, even in those cases where the Courts have considered the extent of their powers to review executive decisions of that kind. Nor do we consider that (4) would be likely to have more than a cosmetic effect, though that alone may be regarded as a worthwhile improvement if the Certificate is re-issued at some future date. 48. As regards (1), we are aware of the corresponding Certificate dated 8 December 2001 issued by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in respect of the SIS and GCHQ. That Certificate was accompanied not only by a statement of the Minister’s Reasons, as here, but also by a document headed “GCHQ Arrangements” which, as we understand the position, is in the public domain. This document sets out clearly both the Minister’s policy in relation to requests made under section 7 of the Act ad the procedure to be followed by GCHQ when responding to them. These further instructions, in our view, are certainly desirable, but the question we have to consider in this appeal is whether the Respondent acted unreasonably in issuing the Certificate unaccompanied by an “Arrangements “ document of that sort. We have concluded that he did not. It seems to us that, in the context of Security Service operations, such guidelines to be useful would have to be reasonably specific, yet they would have to cover a wide range of possible situations where a decision was required. We have noted above the difficulty of attempting to define “national security “ more precisely, and the “GCHQ Arrangements” document does not attempt to do this. Moreover, there would be no means of ensuring that guidelines were complied with, except by complaining to the IPT or (possibly) applying to the Court for judicial review. (Such application could be refused on the ground that the IPT provides a sufficient safeguard against abuse). Conclusions49. We conclude that the Respondent had reasonable grounds for issuing the Certificate dated 10 December 2001. Our primary reason is that an unjustified claim to give a NCND response or to withhold personal data on national security grounds can be made the subject of a complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. 50. We have jurisdiction to rule on whether a NCND response by the Security Services given in accordance with the Certificate was justified in any particular case. The Data Protection Act, in our view, does not provide any means of challenging the Security Services’ decision, either before this Tribunal or before the Courts. It appears to us that the appropriate statutory method of challenging the Security Services’ decision in an individual case is by making a complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. 51. The appeal therefore is dismissed. Further Comment 52. In this case, as in Gosling, the Appellant rightly complains that the letter of response from the Security Services was effectively unsigned. It was subscribed by a “squiggle” which does not identify the writer and which cannot, in our view, be regarded as a signature. 53. This unfortunate factor does not appear to be relevant to the present appeal, but it should not go unrecorded. (Signed) Sir Anthony Evans (President) James Goudie Q.C. Kenneth Parker Q.C. Dated 4 August 2003Annex A Gosling v Secretary of State for the Home Department (pages 14-25)(a) Delegation to the Security Services. 33. Mr. Tam pressed the following argument upon us. He submitted that the Service was best placed, through its experience and expertise, to make the relevant decisions. It is true that the courts in the United Kingdom have traditionally accorded a high degree of deference to the executive on matters affecting national security, the high water mark perhaps being the Zamora [1916] 2 AC 77, where Lord Parker said: “Those who are responsible for the national security must be the sole judge of what the national security requires. It would be obviously undesirable that such matters should be made the subject of evidence in a court of law or otherwise discussed in public” 34. The Zamora was cited in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] 1 AC 374 (“CCSU”) where Lord Scarman put the matter as follows:- “The point of principle in the appeal is as to the duty of the court when in proceedings properly brought before it a question arises as to what is required in the interest of national security. The question may arise in ordinary litigation between private persons as to their private rights and obligations: and it can arise, as in this case, in proceedings for judicial review of a decision by a public authority. The question can take one of several forms. It may be a question of fact which Parliament has left to the court to determine: see for an example section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. It may arise for consideration as a factor in the exercise of an executive discretionary power. But, however it arises, it is a matter to be considered by the court in the circumstances and context of the case. Though there are limits dictated by law and common sense which the court must observe in dealing with the question, the court does not abdicate its judicial function. If the question arises as a factor to be considered in reviewing the exercise of discretionary power, evidence is also needed so that the court may determine whether it should intervene to correct excess or abuse of the power…….My Lords, I conclude, therefore, that where a question as to the interest of national security arises in judicial proceedings the court has to act on evidence. In some cases a judge or jury is required by law to be satisfied that the interest is proved to exist: in others, the interest is a factor to be considered in the review of the exercise of an executive discretionary power. Once the factual basis is established by evidence so that the court is satisfied that the interest of national security is a relevant factor to be considered in the determination of the case, the court will accept the opinion of the Crown or its responsible officer as to what is required to meet it, unless it is possible to show that the opinion was one which no reasonable minister advising the Crown could in the circumstances reasonably have held. There is no abdication of the judicial function, but there is a common sense limitation recognised by the judges as to what is justiciable: and the limitation is entirely consistent with the general development of the modern case law of judicial review.” (404 EG, 406 GH – 407A) 35. In CCSU Lord Diplock stated his view trenchantly: “National security is the responsibility of the executive government, what action is needed to protect its interests is, as the cases cited by my learned friend, Lord Roskill, establish and common sense itself dictates, a matter upon which those upon whom the responsibility rests, and not the courts of justice, must have the last word. It is par excellence a non-justiciable question. The judicial process is totally inept to deal with the sort of problems which it involves” (at 412 EF); see also Lord Fraser at 410G – 403B; Lord Roskill at 420B – 421G. 36. The reluctance of the courts to “second guess” the executive when questions of national security have been in issue has been a feature in more recent cases. In R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Cheblak [1991] 1 WLR 890 the applicant challenged a notice of intended deportation given by the Home Secretary on the grounds that his deportation “would be conducive to the public good for reasons of national security”. The Home Office stated that the applicant’s known links with an organisation which it was believed could taketerrorist action against Western targets in support of the Iraqi regime made his presence in the United Kingdom an unacceptable security risk; and an affidavit sworn on behalf of the Home Secretary stated that further details could not be disclosed because it would be an unacceptable risk to national security to do so. 37. Lord Donaldson MR, in rejecting the application, said: “ … the exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts in cases involving national security is necessarily restricted, not by an unwillingness to act in protection of the rights of individuals or any lack of independence of the Executive, but by the nature of the subject matter. National security is the exclusive responsibility of the Executive and, as Lord Diplock said in CCSU: “It is par excellence a non- justiciable question”” (at 902 gh); see also Beldam L.J. at 912d (“the statement that to give further information might jeopardize national security is one that the court is bound to accept”) and Nolan L.J. at 916b (“the practical result …. Is that the Secretary of State acting in good faith, is effectively protected not only from the risk of appeal, but from the risk of a writ of habeas corpus”. 38. Similarly, in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p. Chahal [1995] 1 WLR 526 the Home Secretary served a deportation notice on the applicant which stated that for reasons of a political nature, namely the international fight against terrorism, his continued presence in the United Kingdom would not be conducive to the public good. During the course of his judgment Staughton L.J. said: “But we cannot determine whether the Secretary of State was right, after the report of the advisory panel, to reach those conclusions. Nor can we review the evidence. That was explained by Dillon L.J. in NHS v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [1998] Imm AR 389 at 395 and by Geoffrey Lane L.J. in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p. Hosenball [1977] I WLR 766 at 783. We have to accept that the evidence justifies those conclusions” (at 531 ef) and later:“… we do not have the evidence on which the Secretary of State considers him a risk to national security, for the reasons already indicated. So we cannot balance the threat [sc. to the applicant’s life] on the one hand against the risk on the other” (at 535 d); cf Neill L.J. at 543 d (“the court has the right to scrutinise a claim that a person should be deported in the interests of national security but in practice this scrutiny may be defective or incomplete if all the relevant facts are not before the Court”) and at 545 b (“on the facts of this case the grounds of national security relied on by the Secretary of State cannot be challenged”). 39. In a somewhat different context in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte McQuillan [1995] 4 All ER 400 the applicant challenged exclusion orders against him under section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 prohibiting him from being in or entering Great Britain on the ground that he was or had been involved in acts of terrorism. An assistant secretary of the Home Office deposed that it was not possible for the applicant, nor was it ever possible for any person against whom such an order was made, to be informed in greater detail of the reasons why the order had been made. Sedley J. was clearly troubled by the lack of judicial control but felt constrained by authority to hold that national security was sufficient to preclude any inquiry by the court into the rationality of the decision and the decision had to be accepted by the court without further scrutiny. 40. This traditional approach of the United Kingdom courts has not, however, met complete approval from the European Court of Human Rights or the Court of Justice of the European Union. Chahal (see paragraph 38 above) found its way to Strasbourg (Chahal v. United Kingdom (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 413), and the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 5(4) of the Convention. The Court recalled that because national security was involved, the domestic courts were not in a position to review whether the decisions to detain the applicant and to keep him in detention were justified on national security grounds (paragraph 130). In an important passage the Court said: “The Court recognises that the use of confidential material may be unavoidable where national security is at stake. This does not mean, however, that thenational authorities can be free from effective control by the domestic courts whenever they choose to assert that national security and terrorism are involved. The court attaches significance to the fact that … in Canada a more effective form of judicial control has been developed in cases of this type. This example illustrates that there are techniques which can be employed which both accommodate legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice (paragraph 131, our emphasis). 41. The Court repeated this formulation in Tinnelly & Sons Ltd v. United Kingdom (1999) 27 E.H.R.R. 249 where the applicant alleged unlawful religious discrimination in the allocation of a public contract and was met by a conclusive ministerial certificate under section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 that the decision not to grant the applicant the contract in question was an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or the protection of public safety or order. 42. The Court in Tinnelly continued as follows: “The introduction of a procedure, regardless of the framework used, which would allow an adjudicator or tribunal fully satisfying the Article 6(1) requirements of independence and impartiality to examine in complete cognizance of all relevant evidence, documentary or other, the merits of the submissions of both sides, may indeed serve to enhance public confidence. The Court observes in addition that McCollum J. [the judge in Northern Ireland] was unable under the present arrangements to dispel his own doubts about certain disturbing features of the Tinnelly case since he, like Tinnelly and the Fair Employment Agency, was precluded from having cognizance of all relevant material in the possession of NIE, the respondent in the proceedings instituted by Tinnelly under the 1976 Act. This situation cannot be said to be conductive to public confidence in the administration of justice” (paragraph 78). 43. In European Community law the most notable case remains Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Case 222/84) [1986] ECR 1651where the applicant, a former woman member of the RUC Reserve, alleged unlawful sexual discrimination and was met by a conclusive ministerial certificate that the act of refusing to offer the applicant further employment in the RUC Reserve was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security and protecting public safety and public order. As to the certificate, the Court of Justice held: “19. By virtue of Art 6 of Directive 76/207 [the equal treatment Directive], interpreted in the light of the general principle stated above, all persons have the right to obtain an effective remedy in a competent court against measures which they consider to be contrary to the principle of equal treatment for men and women laid down in the directive. It is for the member states to ensure effective judicial control as regards compliance with the applicable provisions of Community law and of national legislation intended to give effect to the rights for which the directive provides. 20. A provision which, like Art 53(2) of the 1976 order, requires a certificate such as the one in question in the present case to be treated as conclusive evidence that the conditions for derogating from the principle of equal treatment are fulfilled allows the competent authority to deprive an individual of the possibility of asserting by judicial process the rights conferred by the directive. Such a provision is therefore contrary to the principle of effective judicial control laid down in Art 6 of the directive” (see also R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Gallagher [1996] 1 C.M.L.R. 557, in contrast to McQuillan above). 44. We are fully conscious of the different contexts in which Chahal, Tinnelly and Johnston were decided. Chahal concerned the right not to be unlawfully detained in custody, and Tinnelly and Johnston concerned the right not to be discriminated against on sexual or religious grounds. However, we discern in the European jurisprudence a broader principle to the effect that claims to national security should, save perhaps in the most exceptional and extreme circumstances, be subject to some process of independent scrutiny, even if that process cannot perforce be as intense as might be expected in other situations, and even if a highdegree of deference must continue properly to be accorded to the judgment of the executive, particularly to those within the executive who have long experience and unrivalled expertise in what is arguably the most delicate function of government. This principle is underpinned by the need in a modern democratic society to give fair and proportionate weight to the protected rights or interests of individuals (whether in freedom of person, rights against impermissible discrimination or rights to private life), even in situations where issues of national security are in play; and the principle is also supported by the aim of promoting public confidence in the results that are produced by the chosen procedures. 45. We observe also that Parliament responded to Chahal by enacting the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 which established the Special Immigration Appeals Commission with jurisdiction in cases where the Home Secretary decides to deport a person in the public interest and on national security grounds. The working of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission shows that a form of independent scrutiny is feasible even in relation to national security. 46. It might be objected that any independent checking of the application to a particular case of the certificate which we are considering could lead to such an intense scrutiny that it would itself be detrimental to national security. We do not find such an objection convincing, particularly in the light of the authoritative guidance recently given by the House of Lords on the role appropriate to an independent body assessing claims to national security: Secretary of State for the Home Department v. Rehman [2001] 3 WLR 877 47. In the words of Lord Hoffman: “This brings me to the limitations in the appellate process. First, the commission is not the primary decision-maker. Not only is the decision entrusted to the Home Secretary but he also has the advantage of a wide range of advice from people with day-to-day involvement in security matters which the commission, despite its specialist membership, cannot match. Secondly, as I have just beensaying, the question at issue in this case does not involve a Yes or No answer as to whether it is more likely than not that someone has done something but an evaluation of risk. In such questions an appellate body traditionally allows a considerable margin to the primary decision-maker. Even if the appellate body prefers a different view, it should not ordinarily interfere with a case in which it considers that the view of the Home Secretary is one which could reasonably be entertained. Such restraint may not be necessary in relation to every issue which the commission has to decide …. But I think it is required in relation to the question of whether a deportation is in the interests of national security …. …. The need for restraint flows from a commonsense recognition of the nature of the issue and the differences in the decision-making process and responsibilities of the Home Secretary and the commission” (at 896). See also Lord Slynn at 886; Lord Steyn at 889, and the application of these principles in A v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2003) 2 WLR 564, especially per Lord Woolf CJ at para. 40 and Brooke L.J. at paras. 66-81. 48. In the light of the European jurisprudence to which we have referred, and the Parliamentary response to Chahal, we have serious doubts whether Parliament could have intended that the Service itself would exclusively, without any form of independent scrutiny, determine the application to particular cases of the NCND policy in the kind of circumstances that we have described at paras 30 and 31 above. That doubt is strengthened when we bear in mind the powerful European dimension to the Act which we explained in Baker (see, in particular, paragraphs 50-64): the Act gives effect to the European Community Data Protection Directive, made by the European Parliament and the Council on 24 October 1995, and that Directive in turn gives substance and amplifies inter alia the rights recognised in Art 8 (respect for private life) of the 1950 Convention, now of course given further effect to in UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. (b) The Investigatory Powers Tribunal49. During the course of his submissions Mr. Tam referred to the powers of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (established under section 65 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, “RIPA”). The Investigatory Powers Tribunal deals with a wide range of complaints that may be made about the exercise of powers under RIPA. Tribunals of this kind were previously established under the Interception of Communications Act 1985, the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. These different tribunals are now combined into a single tribunal, with Lord Justice Mummery as its current president. The tribunal is the appropriate forum for dealing with complaints concerned with “conduct” by the intelligence services which relate to the complainant, his or her property or his or her communications. 50. In the light of our concerns in respect of the exclusive decision-making power conferred on the Service by the provisos in the certificate, we asked Mr. Tam whether the respondent accepted that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider any complaint which an individual might wish to make about the giving to him by the Service of an NCND response to a data subject access request made by him. At the hearing Mr. Tam was unable either to confirm or deny whether the respondent did so accept. However, in a subsequent note he made clear the position of the respondent, as follows:- “The Investigatory Powers Tribunal does have jurisdiction to consider any such complaint. Depending on the terms of the complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, such jurisdiction will arise under one or other, or both, of the following provisions:- (a) section 65(2)(b) and 65(4) of the 2000 Act, in that the giving of an NCND response by the Security Service is conduct in relation to that person, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider a complaint by that person if he is aggrieved by such conduct; and (b) section 65(2)(a) of the 2000 Act, in that the giving of an NCND response by the Security Service is an act of a public authority which would be unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 if it isincompatible with a Convention right, and the Tribunal is the only appropriate forum in which a person who claims to be a victim of any unlawful act may bring proceedings against the Security Service to make such a claim.” 51. Jurisdiction cannot, of course, be conferred on the Investigatory Powers Tribunal by agreement or by concession made by the Security Services, let alone the respondent to this appeal. We must, therefore, reach a view as to whether Mr. Tam’s interpretation of section 65 on behalf of the respondent is sustainable. 52. Looking at section 65(5)(a), it would appear at first sight that the unqualified expression “conduct” is wide enough to include conduct of the Security Services in handling requests for personal data under the Act, particularly as section 65(5)(b) – (c) continue by describing more specifically types of conduct that are subject to earlier provisions of RIPA. However, applying general principles of statutory interpretation “conduct” has to be interpreted in the light of the purposes of RIPA. These purposes are accurately set out in the long title as: “To make provision for and about the interception of communications, the acquisition and disclosure of data relating to communications, the carrying out of surveillance, the use of covert human intelligence sources and the acquisition of the means by which electronic data protected by encryption or passwords may be decrypted or accessed …” 53. This description would suggest that “conduct” for the purpose of RIPA has a narrower scope and relates to the matters specifically regulated by RIPA. The “surveillance” falling within Part II of RIPA and hence caught by section 65(5)(b) would appear not to include all forms of surveillance; and it may be that the expression “conduct” in section 65(5)(a) is simply intended to ensure that all forms of surveillance may be made the subject of complaint and of adjudication by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. On this view, “conduct” in this respect must relate to activities of “surveillance”.54. However, even if this narrower construction of “conduct” were correct, and quite apart from the other activities included in the long title, “surveillance” – a matter falling within the scope of RIPA, as the long title shows – is itself fairly widely described in section 48(2) as including: “(a) monitoring, observing or listening to persons, their movements, their conversations or their other activities or communications; (b) recording anything monitored, observed or listened to in the course of surveillance;” (our emphasis) 55. A person seeking personal information from the Security Services could well do so either to discover in the first instance whether he had been the subject of “surveillance”, as broadly understood; or, if he believed that he had been the subject of such surveillance, to discover what had been recorded about him. An NCND answer to a request would, therefore, appear, even if somewhat indirectly, to touch on conduct relating to surveillance; and, even on a narrow construction of “conduct”, the giving of an NCND response would appear to fall within section 65(5)(a). Furthermore, a person confronted with a NCND response may well be in a position to frame proceedings against the Security Services that the action is not compatible with, for example, Article 8 of the Convention. Such proceedings would then fall within section 65(2)(a). 56. Therefore we conclude that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal does have the jurisdiction which Mr. Tam accepted. Furthermore, we believe that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is the body best placed to determine any specific complaint that the Service has applied the provisos to the certificate in a manner that is manifestly unjustified. That Tribunal is presided over by a distinguished senior judge and has the appropriate expertise to investigate a complaint of this nature. In terms of the European jurisprudence to which we have referred, the Tribunal is independent and has the authority to call for evidence and explanation even in matters affecting national security, within the guidelines now laid down by the House of Lords in Rehman. However, we reiterate that, in the absence of the jurisdiction now conceded by the respondent, we would have hadreservations as to whether the procedure contemplated by the provisos to the certificate accorded with the important principle which we have discerned from the European jurisprudence and which we believe is applicable to the present statutory context. (b) Re: Ewing 57. For the sake of completion we should add that Mr. Tam drew our attention to Re: Terence Patrick Ewing (judgment of 20 December 2002, unreported) in which Davis J., in the context of an application to the High Court by a “vexatious litigant” for leave to appeal to this Tribunal, concluded that there were no arguable grounds for holding that the certificate of 10 December 2001 was unlawful (see, in particular, paragraphs 60-65). The applicant in that case did not advance the point that has concerned us in this appeal, and Davis J., was not therefore called upon to deal with it. We believe, therefore, that we should deal fully with the point, as we have done, rather than treating ourselves as bound by the conclusion that he reached in the absence of submissions on the relevant issue. 58. For these reasons, we dismiss the appeal.Annex B Certificate and ‘Reasons Document’ issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department on 10 December 2001ANNEX A Certificate reference:- DPA/s28/TSS/2 SECTION 28 DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998 ______________________________________________ CERTIFICATE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE ______________________________________________ 1. Whereas: (i) by section 28(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act “) it is provided that personal data are exempt from any of the provisions of :- (a) the data protection principles; (b) Parts II, III and V; and (c) section 55 of the Act if the exemption from that provision is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security; (ii) by subsection 28(2) it is provided that a certificate signed by a Minister of the Crown certifying that the exemption from all or any of the provisions mentioned in subsection 28(1) is or at any time was required for the purpose there mentioned in respect of any personal data shall be conclusive evidence of that fact; (iii) by subsection 28(3), it is provided that a certificate under subsection 28(2) may identify the personal data to which it applies by means of a general description and may be expressed to have prospective effect. 2. And considering the potentially serious adverse repercussions for the national security of the United Kingdom if the exemptions hereafter identified were not available. And for the reasons set out in document referenced DPA/S28/TSS/2-REASONS, in summary that: 2.1 The work of the security and intelligence agencies of the Crown requires secrecy. 2.2 The general principle of neither confirming nor denying whether the Security Service processes data about an individual, or whether others are processing personal data for, on behalf of with a view to assist or in relation to the functions of the Security Service, is an essential part of that secrecy. 2.3 In dealing with subject access requests under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Security Service will examine each individual request to determine: i) whether adherence to that general principle is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security; and ii) in the event that such adherence is not required, whether and to what extent the non- communication of any data or any description of data is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 2.4 The very nature of the work of the Security Service requires exemption on national security grounds from those parts of the Act that would prevent it, for example,passing data outside the European Economic Area and that would allow access to the Security Service’s premises by third parties. 3. Now, therefore, I, the Right Honourable David Blunkett MP, being a Minister of the Crown who is a member of the Cabinet, in exercise of the powers conferred by the said section 28(2) do issue this certificate and certify as follows:- 3.1 that any personal data that are processed by the Security Service as described in Column 1 of Part A in the table below are and shall continue to be required to be exempt from those provisions of the Act that are set out in Column 2 of Part A; 3.2 that any personal data that are processed by any other person or body (in circumstances where that data processing comprises or includes the retention or disclosure of data by that other person or body for or to the Security Service) in the course of data processing operations carried out for, on behalf of or at the request of the Security Service or in relation to the functions of the Security Service of the Security Service Act 1989 as described in Column 1 of Part B in the table below are and shall continue to be exempt from those provisions of the Act that are set out in Column 2 of Part B; 3.3 that any personal data that are processed by any other person or body (other than a government department, agency or non-departmental public body) in the course of data processing operations following the data’s disclosure to that person or body by the Security Service in accordance with section 2(2)(a) of the Security Service Act 1989 as described in Column 1 of Part B in the table below are and shall continue to be exempt from those provisions of the Act that are set out in Column 2 of Part B; 3.4. that any personal data that are processed by the Security Service for the purposes set out in Column 1 of Part C in the table below are and shall continue to be required to be exempt from those provisions of the Act that are set out in Column 2 of Part C below; and 3.5. that any personal data that are processed by the Security Service as described in Column 1 of Part D of the table below are and shall continue to be required to be exempt from those provisions of the Act that are set out in Column 2 of Part D below all for the purpose of safeguarding national security, provided that: (i) no data shall be exempt from the provisions of section 7(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 1998 if the Security Service, after considering any request by a data subject for access to relevant personal data, determines that adherence to the principle of neither confirming nor denying whether the Security Service holds data about an individual is not required for the purpose of safeguarding national security; (ii) no data shall be exempt from the provisions of section 7(1)(b), (c) or (d) of the Data Protection Act 1998 if the Security Service, after considering any request by a data subject for access to relevant personal data, determines that non-communication of such data or any description of such data is not required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 4.

Introduction 1.1. The section 28 certificate, document reference DPA/S28/TSS/2, was signed by the Home Secretary following a request made to him by the Security Service. This document explains the reasons he did so. It is made public to allay concerns that anyone may have about the use by the Security Service of the data protection national security exemption that exists under section 28 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 1.2. Before signing the certificate the Home Secretary considered the following factors: i. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), its national security exemptions, and role of the National Security Panel of the Information Tribunal (the ""Tribunal""). ii. The functions of the Security Service and its primary role in the protection of national security. iii. Why secrecy is essential to the work of the Security Service and the damage or potential damage that can be done to national security when secrecy is compromised. iv. The need and use of the neither-confirm-nor-deny policy. v. The Tribunal determination in the appeal by Norman Baker MP against a s28 certificate signed by the previous Home Secretary covering personal data that the Security Service may have processed. vi. The safeguards and statutory controls that exist on the activities of the Security Service. vii. The non-DPA remedies open to anyone who feels aggrieved by anything which he or she believes the Service has done in relation to them or their property. viii. The test that should be used to balance the need to safeguard national security and purposes of the DPA. ix. The form and scope of the certificate. x. The checks, procedures and reporting obligations placed on the Security Service as conditions of their use of the certificate. xi. Other points on the Security Service’s need for use of exemptions under the Data Protection Act 1998.These factors are explained below. 1.3. While this document gives as full as possible account of the reasons why the Home Secretary signed the certificate, it must be remembered that there are other considerations not set out here. These considerations arise from the Home Secretary’s personal detailed knowledge of the secret work of the Security Service. Obviously, these considerations cannot be made public. 1.4. This document focuses on the use of the national security exemption from the entitlement of an individual, under section 7 of the DPA, to be told by a data controller whether or not that data controller holds personal data on that individual and, if held, provide information on the data being held. Almost inevitably, a subject access request will be the first step for anyone concerned by the possibility of the Security Service processing personal data on them. The Security Service is seen to be a data controller. 2. The Data Protection Act 1998, its national security exemptions, and role of the Tribunal 2.1.The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) came into force on 1 March 2000. The DPA made new provisions for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals, including the obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such information. 2.2. Section 7 of the DPA, created a general entitlement for an individual to ask and be told by anyone who decides on purposes of processing personal data whether personal data on them is being processed, which includes being held, and if it is, be told certain information about that data. The entitlement to ask and be told in this way is known as “subject access”. The main rationale for subject access is so an individual can satisfy himself or herself as to what, if any, personal data is being processed about them, that any processing is done for a proper purpose, that the data is accurate, and to whom the data may be disclosed. If dissatisfied with the outcome of their request, the individual can then take corrective action. 2.3. The DPA recognises that there are certain circumstances when it would be inappropriate to comply with certain of the DPA’s provisions, and so provides several exemptions. One, at DPA section 28, exempts personal data from a number of provisions, including those of subject access, if the exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 2.4. DPA section 28 also provides that a Cabinet Minister may sign a certificate as conclusive evidence of the need for the use of the national security exemption. The certificate may identify the personal data to which it applies by means of a general description and may cover personal data processed after the date the certificate came into effect. Such a certificate will channel appeals against that certificate or its coverage to the National Security Panel of the Information Tribunal (the Tribunal) for consideration and determination. 2.5. The Tribunal considers appeals against a section 28 certificate by applying the principles used by the court on a judicial review. If the Tribunal determines the Minister did not have reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate or the actions in issuing the certificate were not proportionate for the purpose, the Tribunal may quash the certificate. 3. The functions of the Security Service and its primary role in the protection of national security.3.1. The functions of the Security Service are set down in law – the Security Service Acts 1989 and 1996. It has three functions: protect national security, safeguard the economic well- being of the United Kingdom against threats posed outside of the British Islands, and - following the 1996 Act – support law enforcement agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime. The 1996 Act defines such crime. The 1989 Act places the Security Service under the authority of the Secretary of State. 3.2. A booklet – MI5, The Security Service – explains in some detail the work of the Security Service. As the Service’s Director General summarised in his introduction to the booklet, the Security Service’s tasks are both to investigate and to counter covertly organised threats to the UK such as terrorism and espionage. The booklet explains that the Government decided that the Service should use its know-how, gained from their national security work, in support of law enforcement agencies in combating serious crime. This led to the 1996 Act. The booklet is available from the HMSO. Similar information is also available on the Security Service’s Internet web site. The address is: http://www.securityservice.gov.uk. 3.3. The work of the Security Service is vital in safeguarding the national security of the United Kingdom. Intelligence successes relating to national security can, and have: · Saved the lives of British nationals and other persons; · Prevented the spread of weapons of mass destruction; · Thwarted those who would overthrow or undermine the United Kingdom's parliamentary democracy through terrorism and other means; and · Countered the actions of foreign powers intent in damaging the interests of the country. 3.4. Members of the Security Service have no powers to question or arrest anyone, or demand entry into premises or demand to search anyone or anything. They are not like police or customs officers. 4. Why secrecy is essential to the work of the Security Service and damage and potential damage that can be done to national security when secrecy is compromised. 4.1. Secrecy is essential to the work of the Security Service. Many individuals who co- operate with the Service –such as agents - only do so under guarantee of complete confidentiality and anonymity. If their identity became known not only would it jeopardise the work in hand and their future co-operation but also it would put them at personal risk. Such a risk is not fanciful, as a large part of the Security Service's work comprises the investigation of terrorists. Clearly, the same risks apply to members of the Security Service itself. 4.2. Secrecy is also essential because the Security Service undertakes investigations covertly. The Service’s effectiveness lies in its ability to obtain and exploit secret intelligence, which those under investigation may go to some lengths to keep hidden. As well as the use of agents mentioned above, sources of secret intelligence include:a. the interception of communications, b. eavesdropping, and c. surveillance. Clearly, such techniques lose much if not all of their effectiveness if it is known when and how they are used. 4.3. So, if an individual were to become aware that they were subject to a Security Service investigation, they could not only take steps to thwart it but also attempt to discover, and perhaps reveal, the methods of investigation used, or the identities of the Security Service officers, or agents involved in such methods of investigation. Compromise of methods or personnel affects both the individual investigation and potentially all other such investigations as the risk of deploying such methods and personnel is increased. Similarly, increased knowledge of methods of investigation deployed by the Security Service, and other agencies, would greatly assist those such as terrorists, spies, and serious criminals in planning their activities, so as to the reduce the likelihood of detection or interference. 4.4. Ultimately, the undermining of the effectiveness of the Security Service could result in the loss of, or a reduction in, the deterrence of those who may be tempted to damage national security. In addition, it could also result in the loss of, or a reduction in, the reputation of the Security Service itself. This could lead to a reduction in the co-operation that the Security Service actively receives from individuals and organisations both at home and abroad and also to an impairment of the ability of the Security Service itself to recruit staff. Anything that weakens the effectiveness of the Security Service weakens the UK’s ability to safeguard national security. 5. The need for and use of the “neither confirm nor deny” policy. 5.1. It has been the policy of successive governments neither to confirm nor to deny suggestions put to them on the work of the intelligence and security agencies including the Security Service. Put simply, the policy is a way to preserve the secrecy described above by giving a vague and non-committal answer. 5.2. The need for such a policy and Parliament's acceptance of this is reflected in legislation. Such legislation includes the Security Service Act 1989, which places a duty on the Director General to ensure that no information is disclosed by the Service except so far as necessary for the proper discharge of its functions. It also includes the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. The 1989 Act makes it unlawful for a member of the Security Service to make any unauthorised disclosure of information held by virtue of their work, or make any such disclosure purporting to be on such information or one intended to be take as such. It also includes the predecessor to the current Data Protection Act, namely the Data Protection Act 1984. The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, Second Edition 1997, gives ""information whose disclosure would harm national security"" as a category of information that is exempt from the provisions of the Code. 5.3. The Government applies the policy to Security Service investigations and to suggestions of whether a particular individual or group is or has been under investigation. To ask whether the Security Service holds personal data on an individual often amounts to asking whether there is or has been an investigation.5.4. By logical extension, the policy must apply even if no investigation has taken place. If the Security Service said when it did not hold information on a particular person, inevitably over time those on whom it did hold information would be able incrementally to deduce that fact. Not least because they would not receive the same assurance given to others. 5.5. If individuals intent on damaging national security could confirm that they were not subjects of interest to the Security Service, then they could undertake their activities with increased confidence and vigour. Another complexity would be the handling of cases where the Service had confirmed no interest in an individual or group but subsequently it took an interest. Would the Security Service be obliged to tell the earlier enquirer that the circumstances had changed? In any event, the response to repeat requests would reveal the change in circumstances. In either case, damage is done not only in the way described in section 4, but also the timing of the change would be helpful to those under investigation. For example, a terrorist may work out what he or she had done at that time to give themselves away. If so, they, and others they told, could avoid such actions in the future - ultimately, this would help them in carrying out their acts of terror. 5.6. Conversely, confirmation to individuals that they are subjects of interest may create or fuel suspicions that associates of theirs are assisting the Security Service. The consequences of this could be harm to those who are in fact providing assistance, harm to those wrongly suspected of such assistance; and eventually in either case harm to the work of the Security Service in that the potential of personal harm to such persons would act as a strong deterrent to anyone assisting the Security Service, both in the investigation in question and in any other. 5.7. There are circumstances when the neither confirm nor deny policy is not used. Usually when it has been officially confirmed that the Security Service had undertaken an investigation, for example when a terrorist had been prosecuted, or when the interests of national security require a disclosure. 6. The safeguards and statutory controls that exist on the activities of the Security Service. 6.1. By their very nature, the Security Service’s covert investigations are intrusive into the privacy of individuals. For this reason, there a number of constraints, oversight arrangements and safeguards placed on the Security Service. These include: 6.1.1. Legal constraints placed on the Security Service and its work, or its Director General, by Parliament through: i. the Security Service Acts 1989 and 1996, ii. the Intelligence Services Act 1994, and iii. the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This law governs the interception of communications, the carrying out of surveillance and the use of “covert human intelligence sources”, eg undercover officers or agents. 6.1.2. Oversight by the Home Secretary. This in turn includes : i. regular meetings with the Director General; ii. visits to Thames House to talk with staff there;iii. advice from officials who are in daily contact with the Security Service; iv. personal authorisation of warranted activity under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and Intelligence Services Act 1994; v. scrutiny of the Director-General's statutory Annual Report; vi. scrutiny of the Security Service Annual Performance and Priority Report; vii. calling for other reports where necessary; viii. giving evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee, considering their reports, and participating in Commons’ debates on their reports; ix. scrutiny of the reports of the independent Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners who see everything relevant to their function. 6.1.3. Oversight by the Intelligence and Security Committee. This is an independent committee of members of both Houses of Parliament established under the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Its terms of reference are the same as most parliamentary departmental select committees. The Committee has its own Investigator who can look into and expand on the detail of evidence given to the Committee. 6.1.4. Oversight by the independent Intelligence Services Commissioner. This role was created by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and combines the previous roles of the Security Service Act Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Act Commissioner. The Commissioner must hold or have held a high judicial office. As stated above, the Commissioner sees all information relevant to his or her functions. 6.1.5. Oversight by the independent Interception Commissioner. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 created this role although there had been a previous Commissioner under the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The Commissioner must hold or have held a high judicial office. He or she too sees all information relevant to his or her functions. 6.1.6. The Security Service’s performance, plans and priorities are subject to external scrutiny by a senior Whitehall Committee known as JIC (the Joint Intelligence Committee). The resultant report is subject to approval by senior Ministers. 6.1.7. Oversight, in financial matters, by the National Audit Office. 6.1.8. Significantly in the context of data protection, the Security Service Act 1989 places duties on the Security Service’s Director General concerning the obtaining and disclosure of information. The Director General must “ensure that arrangements are in place for securing that no information is obtained by the Service except so far as necessary for the proper discharge of its functionsor disclosed by it except so far as necessary for that purpose or for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime”. 6.1.9. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 also set up the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. This is described below. 7. Non-Data-Protection-Act Remedies 7.1. Anyone who feels aggrieved by anything which he or she believes the Security Service has done in relation to them or their property may complain to the independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The Tribunal will also hear claims relating to the Security Service under the Human Rights Act. Created under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Tribunal replaces the earlier Security Service Tribunal. Members of the Tribunal must qualify as lawyers. A duty to co-operate with the Tribunal is placed on everyone holding office under the Crown – this includes all members of the Security Service. There is no bar to what Tribunal members can see when looking into a complaint. If the Tribunal upholds the complaint, it can award compensation or make any other order that it sees fit. The address of the Tribunal is: PO Box 33220, LONDON SW1H 9ZQ. 8. The test that should be used to balance the need to safeguard national security and purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. 8.1. The DPA section 28 states “personal data are exempt … if the exemption … is required for the purpose for safeguarding national security”. However, the term national security is not defined. Both domestic and European courts have accepted that the Government has significant discretion in what constitutes national security. In addition, when considering safeguarding national security the courts have accepted 1 that it is proper to take a precautionary approach. That is, it is not necessary only to consider circumstances where actual harm has or will occur to national security, but also to consider preventing harm occurring and avoiding the risk of harm occurring. 8.2. Even so, the Home Secretary has balanced the need to safeguard national security against the purposes and entitlements conferred by the DPA. The risk to national security through the compromise of the work of the Security Service has been covered above. This was balanced against the factors below: i. the consequences of an individual not knowing whether the Security Service processes personal data on them arising from a covert investigation; ii. if processed, an individual not knowing the purpose why it is processed; iii. if processed, an individual not knowing whether the data is accurate; iv. if processed, to whom the data may be disclosed; v. the consequences of, for practical purposes, denying an individual of the opportunity to challenge the purpose for processing, the accuracy of data and opportunity to challenge to whom the data may be disclosed; 1 The House of Lord’s Judgement of 11 October in the appeal of Shafiq Ur Rehman against deportation, Secretary of State for the Home Department (11 October 2001 [2001] UKHL47).vi. the consequences to national security of the individual not correcting inaccurate personal data on him or her; and vii. the consequences of the Information Commissioner or the courts not having a role in examining the use of the national security exemption in regard to DPA provisions. 8.3. In weighing the above factors, the Home Secretary took account of legal constraints and controls placed on the Security Service, the lack of Security Service executive powers and that their investigations in all but rare cases are kept secret. 9. The form and scope of the certificate. 9.1. The certificate has taken account of the determination of the National Security Panel of the Information in the appeal by Norman Baker MP against the previous certificate signed on behalf of the Security Service. 9.2. As expressly permitted by the DPA, the certificate identifies personal data by general description and it covers personal data processed after the date the certificate came into effect. A general description certificate reflects the primary function of the Security Service, set out in law, to protect national security. Otherwise, an individual certificate would be required for every appeal against the Security Service’s use of the national security exemption. It should be noted that in the vast majority of cases the Service will need to use the exemption to preserve the neither confirm nor deny policy or to limit the extent of disclosure. The administrative burden of ad hoc certificates, taken together with the fact that only Cabinet Ministers may sign such certificates, were also factors taken into consideration for the form and scope of the certificate. 9.3. The terms of the certificate were drafted to reflect the functions of the Security Service and the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. A proportionate approach was adopted; careful consideration was given to the range of exemptions truly required in respect of each of the different categories of personal data, so that only the necessary exemptions were certified in respect of each category. 9.4. In particular, in line with the comments of the Tribunal, the neither confirm nor deny principle is preserved, subject to some exceptions. For example, it is not to possible to sustain the principle in respect to former employees of the Security Service. Even so, it may still be necessary, to safeguard national security, to withhold information about personal data that may have been processed. 9.5. The Home Secretary was aware that the personal data covered by the certificate might have been, or might be being, processed by the Security Service in the exercise of its function to support law enforcement agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime. However, again in line with the policy of successive governments, the Home Secretary took the view that the complete separation of the national security and serious crime functions of the Security Service was impossible. The work of the Security Service in respect of any individual may often be carried out simultaneously under both of these functions. 9.6. The methodology, operating techniques, and resources of the Security Service are common to all three of its functions. It would be impossible to maintain a ""neither confirm nor deny"" approach to personal data processed under the Security Service's national security function if that approach were not adopted to personal data obtained under the serious crimefunction. Carefully directed or persistent enquiries made by an individual in respect of the serious crime function of the Security Service would lead to a grave risk of revealing whether the Security Service processed data in respect of that individual under its national security function. Therefore, the Home Secretary considered that exemption of all such personal data was required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. The same reasoning of course applies to the Security Service's other function of safeguarding the economic well-being of the country. 9.7. The certificate gives notice of the checks, procedures and reporting obligations placed on the Security Service as condition of their use of the certificate. These obligations are linked for the first time to the certificate in light of the Tribunal’s determination mentioned in paragraph 9.1 above. The obligations ensure that while its terms are widely drawn that the Security Service will only use the national security exemption when necessary. 10. The checks, procedures and reporting obligations placed on the Security Service as condition of their use of the certificate. 10.1. The checks, procedures and reporting obligations on the Security Service are set out in the certificate, document reference DPA/S28/TSS/2. The Home Secretary also considered the Security Service arrangements for dealing with DPA subject access requests as set out in their internal protocol document. 10.2. In summary, the obligations require the Security Service to examine each subject access application and, for the purposes of safeguarding national security,: i. decide the whether the use of the neither confirm nor deny approach is necessary, ii. otherwise decide to what extent the national security exemption is still necessary; and iii. to report back to the Home Secretary on the working of these arrangements. 11. Other points on the Security Service’s need for use of exemptions under the Data Protection Act 1998. 11.1. When signing the certificate, the Home Secretary noted that other DPA exemptions might well also apply to the personal data covered by the certificate. 11.2. In addition, the signing of this certificate did not exclude the possible necessity of signing other national security certificates relating to personal data processed by the Security Service. 12. Conclusion 12.1. Having considered the factors above and given his knowledge of the secret work of the Security Service, the Home Secretary decided it was right for him to sign the certificate as requested by the Security Service."
"210","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0179/A Heard at Birmingham Combined Court On 30 October 2019 and 30 January 2020 Before JUDGE HOLMES ANNE CHAFER JOHN RANDALL Between JULIAN SAUNDERS Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and SANDWELL METROPOLITAN BOROUGH COUNCIL Second Respondent Appearances: Appellant : In Person First Respondent: Written Submissions Second Respondent: Mr Robin Hopkins, Counsel DECISION AND REASONS 1. The Tribunal allows the appeal, the Decision Notice, no. FS50738692, dated 30 April 2019 is revoked, and the following Decision is substituted in its place: 1.The public authority was entitled to withhold the requested information pursuant to s.40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as the same constituted personal data, the processing of which would not be in accordance with the data protection principles, and which it was not in the public interest to disclose. 12. The public authority, further , was entitled to withhold the requested information pursuant to s.31(1)(g) and s.31(2)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as to disclose the same would be likely to prejudice the public authority in exercising its function of carrying out an investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person had been responsible for conduct which was improper, and which it was not in the public interest to disclose, and no further action is required from the public authority. REASONS 2. In this appeal the Appellant , Julian Saunders, appeals against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner on 30 April 2019, in which she determined that (save for a delay in responding to the complaint) the public authority, Sandwell MBC (“Sandwell” or “the Council”) , had correctly applied s.30(1)(b) of the FOIA, and had correctly withheld the requested information. 3. The Appellant appealed the Decision Notice by a Notice of Appeal dated 26 May 2019. In the Notice the Appellant indicated that he required a Decision after a hearing. He filed further grounds of appeal, entitled “Possible ICO Bias” on 2 July 2019 4. The Commissioner filed her response to the appeal on 5 July 2019. She was content for a hearing on paper and was content to rely upon written representations. 5. The Tribunal issued case management directions on 20 June 2019. It directed that Sandwell be joined as Second Respondent and made directions for that party to file a response. Sandwell did so on 17 July 2019. Further Directions were given by the Registrar on 20 September 2019 (amended on 27 September 2019). She directed that closed material be held pursuant to rule 14(6), and recorded what had been received by the Tribunal, and considered what the Panel was to be permitted to see in the redacted material. The hearing date of 30 October 2019 was notified to the parties in these Directions. 6. The Appellant attended the appeal in person. The Commissioner did not appear at the hearing but submitted written submissions in the appeal. The Second Respondent was represented by Mr Hopkins of Counsel. There were two Hearing bundles, one open (in two parts), and one closed. References to page numbers are to the pages in the open bundle, which follow sequentially across the two parts. 7. The Tribunal started to hear the appeal on 30 October 2019. The Appellant made his submissions first but did not give evidence. The Second Respondent made submissions in the afternoon of the hearing, and called David Stevens, the Interim Chief Executive of Sandwell. He gave evidence in open session, 2when he was cross – examined by the Appellant and gave further evidence then in closed session. 8. That took the Tribunal to the end of the hearing day, so it adjourned, part heard, resuming in open session on 30 January 2020. In the interim, a gist of the closed session was prepared, approved by the Tribunal, and provided to the Appellant. The Tribunal resumed the hearing on 30 January 2020, when final submissions were heard. 9. The Judge apologises for the delay in promulgation, occasioned initially by pressure of judicial business, and more latterly, by the restrictions occasioned by the Covid – 19 emergency which has limited access to judicial premises and resources. The Decision Notice. 10. The Decision Notice that is the subject of this appeal is dated 30 April 2019 (No. FS50738692), and relates to the Appellant’s FOIA request of 30 January 2018, given the reference no. FS – Case – 76135478 by Sandwell [pages 39 to 40 of the bundle]. The Background. 11. The background to the request made by the Appellant which gives rise to this appeal is that the Appellant is the author of a blog “the sandwellskidder”, in which he comments upon the actions and conduct of Sandwell as a local authority, and local political issues. 12. On or about 24 January 2018 the Council suspended seven secretaries in the Cabinet secretariat of the Council, following concerns that had been raised that there had been a “leak” , a breach of confidentiality, in relation to a meeting of the Ethics and Standards Sub Committee that was to take place that day in relation to a Councillor, and indeed, did take place that day. An application was made that the meeting be postponed. The issue was that there had been a pre-meeting discussion the day before the Sub – Committee meeting, which had come to the attention of the Councillor’s representative, and was the subject of complaint that this was a secret “briefing” , which could have had the purpose or effect of compromising the Sub – Committee meeting the following day. 13. The suspensions were carried out that day, or over the next two days. Subsequently it came to light that none of the secretaries was responsible for the leak, and the decision was made to lift their suspensions. That occurred on, it seems, 31 January 2018. 314. The Appellant made his FOIA request that day, in these terms [page 39 of the bundle]: “Today Darren Carter has written to members saying ’the suspension of employees in the Cabinet Secretariat was taken by Council Managers on HR advice’ and that “the suspensions have been lifted”. The said “Council Managers” can have no presumption of anonymity in respect of such a serious act. Documents identifying lower status employees should be disclosed but with their identities suitably redacted. 1. What offence are the seven employees alleged to have committed? 2. How did “Council Managers” become aware of the alleged offence? What evidence did they obtain before taking the extreme measure of suspension? 3. Please disclose all documentation with regard to the investigation from outset to conclusion including all emails, file notes and any other documentation arising in connection with this whole affair including the request for HR advice and the advice given. 4. Identify the Council Managers involved in this affair and their individual involvement in the same. 5. When was suspension lifted and why? Were all seven employees allowed to return to their positions without sanction? If not why not? “ 15. The Appellant’s request was acknowledged that day and given the reference FS-Case-67027833 by the Council. The Appellant added to his request a further request later the same day in which he made reference to the suspensions being carried out by Stuart Taylor, and he sought the contract of employment or other delegated authority permitting him to act in the manner that he did. 16. The Council’s response to the request was not provided until 23 March 2018 [pages 41 to 42 of the bundle]. The requested information was withheld as exempt by virtue of s.30(1)(a) and (b), investigations, and s.40(2), personal data. The council went on to state that under the s.30(1) exemption it would not be in the public interest to release information which is the subject of internal investigations. In relation to s.40(2, release of this personal information not constitute a fair processing of the data and therefore would be a breach of the first principle within the Data Protection Act 1998. The response went on to state that the right to privacy outweighed any public interest in release of the information. 17. The Appellant was advised of his right to seek an internal review, and thereafter of his right to complain to the Commissioner. 418. The Appellant did seek an internal review, on 20 May 2018 [page 43 of the bundle]. In his application he said this: “Council employees are regularly named in SMBC documents and reports. They have no reasonable expectation of anonymity when doing the normal job they are paid for by us taxpayers save where security or other issues require. It is senior managers involved in this fiasco and it needs to be said what the (false) allegations were and who made the decision to suspend the seven in the absence of Jan Britton and, seemingly, other persons at Director level. Stuart Taylor is already identified in this saga. He is an employee way below Director level and it seems inconceivable that he has been given the delegated power to suspend seven secretaries. Did he have the requisite delegated powers to take such drastic action? Today I have received confirmation that the seven secretaries had [sc. “been”] innocent of the allegations against them that led to their suspension. Further they have received compensation but subject to them signing confidentiality clauses. Tis is wholly unacceptable and it is clearly in the public interest that the truth about what happened here is disclosed not least because some sort of disciplinary action is required against the “Council Managers” who made such a catastrophic decision based on false evidence. The taxpayer as had to pay for this shambles and deserves to know the truth . I await the internal review.” 19. The Council conducted the review, on 10 July 2018 [pages 44 to 46 of the bundle]. The Council repeated the Appellant’s original request and confirmed that the information requested was held. It asserted, however, that it was exempt pursuant to s.30(1) of the FOIA as it was incorporated into an investigation undertaken by the Council and was therefore covered by that section. 20. The review then went on to apply the public interest test. The reviewer stated the Council’s belief that , whilst there was a requirement for openness and transparency , there remained times when information collected during internal investigations were not placed in the public domain, as by doing so would prejudice future investigations as people would be less willing to provide information if they knew it would be disclosed into a public forum. 21. Further, the Council considered that all but Q4 raised by the Appellant constituted personal information and this would not be disclosed on the basis of s.40(2) of the FOIA. 22. By way of summary of the provisions that the Council were relying upon, they were: 5Freedom of Information Act 2000 30 Investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities (1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it has at any time been held by the authority for the purposes of– (a) any investigation which the public authority has a duty to conduct with a view to it being ascertained– (i) whether a person should be charged with an offence, or (ii) whether a person charged with an offence is guilty of it, (b) any investigation which is conducted by the authority and in the circumstances may lead to a decision by the authority to institute criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct, or (c) any criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct. (2) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if– (a) it was obtained or recorded by the authority for the purposes of its functions relating to– (i) investigations falling within subsection (1)(a) or (b), (ii) criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct, And, in relation to personal data: 40 Personal information (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which does not fall within subsection (1), and (b) the first, second or third condition below is satisfied. (3A) The first condition is that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act— (a) would contravene any of the data protection principles, or The ICO’s investigation. 623. The Appellant complained to the ICO on 13 April 2018 [page 47 of the bundle], and his complaint was assigned reference no. FS50738692 in a response from the ICO dated 16 May 2018 [page 47 of the bundle]. The Appellant wrote further to the ICO on 21 May 2018 [page 49 of the bundle] to say that he had originally applied for an internal review, and had applied for another one, which he was monitoring. 24. The ICO informed Sandwell of the complaint by writing to Sandwell on 16 July 2018 [pages 51 to 52 of the bundle]. An Investigating Officer (“IO”) was then allocated the investigation of the complaint. On 24 July 2019 he asked Sandwell to provide him with a copy of withheld information, together with any further arguments that Sandwell wished to advance in support of the application of sections 30(1) and 40(2) of the FOIA. 25. After some delay, Sandwell replied to the ICO on 22 August 2018 [pages 58 to 59 of the bundle, in redacted form] . The unredacted version appears in the closed material. There is very little in the way of redaction and the Council’s arguments can be discerned and understood perfectly well without the need for sight of the redacted details. 26. On 3 September 2018 the IO wrote to Stuart Taylor [page 60 of the bundle] asking him when the file note, which was amongst the withheld material, was prepared, pointing out that if it was after 31 January 2018 it fell outside the scope of the request. Stuart Taylor replied on 5 September 2018 [page 61 of the bundle] saying that the file note was prepared on 30 January. He also made reference to the suspension letters, a sample of which he enclosed in unredacted form. He went on to say how the only other written information held was the email from the person who alerted the Council to the situation which led to the suspensions. He also informed the ICO of his impending departure from the Council, and provided a new contact, Mr Philip Tart. 27. On 7 September 2018 the IO wrote to Mr Tart [page 62 of the bundle] asking for more information and making reference to hyperlinks to press articles in which the suspensions were already in the public domain. He asked, in the light of this, if the Council would be prepared to disclose a redacted version of the information. 28. Maria Price it was, in fact, who replied to the ICO on 19 September 2018 [pages 63 to 65 of the bundle]. In this email, redacted in the open bundle, she provided further information, in relation to the five specific questions raised in the request. She referred to the only records being the “letters of dismissal” (inaccurate, of course, as the employees were suspended not dismissed) , and went on to provide the information sought by the ICO. She went on to explain the Council’s application of s.30 of FOIA, both s.30(1a) (i) and (ii) and s.30(1b). She referred to the Council’s authority to undertake investigations against officers for a variety of reasons. She also went on to refer to s.30(2)(a)(i) as 7exempting this information from disclosure. She referred to the Commissioner’s published guidance on s.30. 29. She said the Council was acting “under the Employment Rights Act 1996”, as well as the common law duty of confidentiality. She also referred to s.40 of the FOIA, in particular s.40(3(a)(i)(ii). She went on to say that the Council was of the opinion that disclosing anything in relation to the Cabinet Secretaries would personally identify them as individuals, and there was a real concern that disclosing the information would, in all likelihood cause significant distress to the individuals concerned. 30. The IO wrote to the Appellant on 20 September 2018 [page 66 of the bundle], informing him of the response that he had received from the Council, and asking if there was any further information that was in the public domain, apart from the article in the Express and Star which had been referred to. 31. The Appellant replied on 13 October 2018 [page 67 of the bundle]. In this email he said that he had not been able to locate any other public information but had written about all this in his own blog. He went on to summarise the events of the suspension and its lifting and who the Council had stated had taken the decision. He went on the refer to the fact that six of the seven had received compensation, but one, whom he named, had not. 32. The ICO responded on 3 December 218 indicating that a Decision Notice would soon be issued, but on 15 January 2019 wrote further to the Council [page 69 of the bundle] asking for more details of the Council’s case on the s.30 exemption. Maria Price of the Council replied on 8 February 2019 [pages 71 to 72 of the bundle]. She clarified the position and referred to the Council having a duty under the Employment Rights Act 1996 to ensure that if and when allegations are raised about employees they are properly investigated. She confirmed the sequence of events, and how the investigations were conducted as part of the employer’s disciplinary process. She went on to say how the Council had a duty to ensure that its employees act properly and to investigate employees suspected of disciplinary or criminal offences. 33. In relation to the three criteria for s.30(1)(b) , reference was made to the Council’s powers under s.1 of the Localism Act 2011, and s.222 of the Local Government Act 1972 , under which it had power to institute and conduct any criminal proceedings , which in this instance would potentially have been for interference with the Standards regime for an elected member. The IC’s Decision Notice. 34. The Decision Notice was sent to the Appellant and the Council on 30 April 2019 [pages 1 to 7 of the bundle]. 835. The Commissioner found that s.30(1) was engaged. The Council’s position was rehearsed, and, in relation to its power to prosecute, accepted by the Commissioner. She accepted that the requested information related to an investigation which fell within s.30(1)(b) of the FOIA, and was accordingly exempt, subject to the public interest test. 36. In applying that test (at paras. 26 to 34 of the Decision Notice), the Commissioner, whilst recognising the public interest in promoting openness and transparency, concluded that, whilst the fact of the suspensions and the subsequent reinstatements was in the public domain, the reasons why, and the persons responsible, were not. 37. She recognised the need for protection of a safe space to allow internal investigations in relation to matters in which criminal proceedings may be contemplated. She also recognised the need to prevent the inhibition of participants in the investigatory process because of fear that their comments may be subsequently made pubic via the FOIA. She therefore concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. 38. As she held that the s.30 exemption was made out, she did not go on to consider the s.40(2) grounds also advanced by the Council. 39. She did, however, acknowledge that the Council had been in breach of the requirement to respond to the request within 20 working days, and had thereby breached s.10 of the FOIA. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal, and submissions. 40. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal are in the bundle [pages 15 to 19]. 41. In essence, the Appellant , after setting out his concerns that there had been wrongdoing in relation to the initial pre – meeting, which the Council wished to cover – up, and there was never any potential for criminal proceedings, he then goes through the public interest test as applied by the Commissioner, and advances his arguments as to why the decision was wrong, and why the public interest favours , consistently with the presumption , disclosure. These Grounds were elaborated upon in the appeal and need not be rehearsed again here. The IC’s response to the appeal. 42. The IC did not appear, but her written submissions, dated 5 July 2019 [pages 24 to 29] uphold the Council’s position. The Commissioner found that s.30 was engaged, and that the public interest favoured the maintaining of the exemption. She did not advance any argument in support of the s.40(2) 9exemption, as she had indeed not determined the case on that basis. She held that the allegedly defective nature of the investigation and any alleged “cover – up” were irrelevant. She cited Toms v Informaion Commissioner (EA/2005/0027) in support of her conclusion. The Second Respondent’s response and submissions. 43. Mr Hopkins prepared the written response for the Second Respondent [pages 30 to 36 of the bundle]. It initially refers to the Appellant’s history of FOIA requests and appeals, and his campaign of public commentary, which is alleged to, on occasion, be humiliating and demeaning. This was relied upon in support of a contention that disclosure may, firstly, make individuals less likely to volunteer input to investigations, and secondly, be likely to cause damage and distress to affected individuals. 44. Reliance was placed on s.30, but in the alternative, s.31(1) of the FOIA was advanced. 45. The relevant provisions of s.31 relied upon were: 31. Law enforcement (1) Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice– (a) to (f) N/a (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (h) N/a (2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are– (a) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, 46. Under either provision, disclosure was likely to prejudice the Council’s ability to conduct investigations. The balance of the public interest lay with non – disclosure, and the Appellant had given a misleading characterisation of the events leading to the suspensions. 47. He did, however, go on to advance a case under s.40(2) of the FOIA, arguing in the alternative, that that the suspended secretaries had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to their suspension , and , absent their consent, disclosure could not be justified under Schedule 2 to the DPA 1998 as a proportionate means of serving a pressing social need. 10The hearing(s) 48. Prior to the hearing, on 22 October 2019 , the Appellant submitted further documents he wished to be considered, comprising of (open) communications between the Council and Unite the Union, which represented six of the suspended employees, and the apology that the Council issued to six of the secretaries, in August 2019, following an investigation that was subsequently held. He numbered these documents 80A to 98A. 49. For the Second Respondent Mr Hopkins provided a Summary of the Council’s position , dated 24 October 2019, in which he advanced, in the alternative, a further submission based upon the “steps discretion” which arises under s.50(4) of the FOIA, in relation to the Commissioner, and hence also is available to the Tribunal when hearing an appeal under s.58. 50. At the first hearing the Appellant, at the outset, made an application that the proceedings be recorded. The basis for this was that he wanted to ensure that there were no misrepresentations or distortions of the proceedings, as he did not, in short, trust the Council. The Second Respondent was neutral upon the application. The Tribunal considered it, but did not consider that the Appellant had made out any good grounds for the Tribunal to depart from its normal practice of not allowing recording of its proceedings. 51. Before the Tribunal was an Open bundle, in two parts, pages 1 to 74, and pages 75 to 121. The latter contains, at pages 117 to 121, a Witness Statement from David Stevens, the Interim Chief Executive of the Second Respondent. He conducted an investigation in August 2019 into the suspensions and commissioned an independent report from an external consultant. As a result of that , further documents came to light, and , following a meeting on 22 October 2019, those further documents which had not previously been disclosed in response to the Appellant’s FOIA request were then, in redacted form, provided to him, and are in the second part of the open bundle. The Appellant’s oral submissions. 52. The Appellant made his submissions, in essence amplifying his Grounds of Appeal. He considered that the Council was, at the relevant time at least, dysfunctional, and wrongdoing had occurred, which it was trying to cover up by relying upon the FOIA to deny his request for all of the information relevant to the improper suspension of the affected employees. He referred to the Council’s characterisation of him as a troublemaker, with five previous appeals, and criticism of his blogging activities. But three of his appeals had been settled, and more information was released. 53. He referred to having received the latest material 631 days after his request, when it had been “magicked up” by the Council. He referred to what he 11considered were the Council’s attempts to discredit him with the ICO, and what he saw as the ICO’s failures to deal with this, and indeed four other cases, properly. 54. He agreed that the secretaries were the victims in all of this, and he had been present on the day when these events had started. He was supporting the secretaries, this was the reason for the speed of his request. There were local newspaper reports, and this was a major piece of news. It was crazy to suggest that there was any expectation of privacy, the entire Council knew of the suspensions which were the subject of gossip, and a major story. 55. The secretaries have been reinstated, but the Express and Star had run a story six days previously, and an apology had been given to them. 56. It was not the secretaries whom he had been trying to identify, but managers. He had been very fair to junior employees. 57. He took the Tribunal through the Decision Notice. He considered that the legal argument relied upon by the Commissioner and the Second Respondent in relation to s.30(1) of the FOIA was nonsense. There was no question of criminality involved, as the Second Respondent now appeared to accept. The Council could not rely upon s.30 in respect of all investigations in general. 58. In relation to the withheld material that he was seeking, it was the allegations and suspension letters that he wished to see. Unite the Union was never informed of any interviews or action taken. The file note in question was made after the trade union representative had spoken to the investigating officer. 59. He went on to refer to the Employment Rights Act 1998, as is referred to in paragraph 20 of the Decision Notice, which was, as the Judge agreed, clearly wrong, as the date of that Act is 1996. 60. He agreed that the investigation could have been used for disciplinary purposes but did not understand how it would be likely that secretaries could be prosecuted for interfering with the standards regime for the conduct of an elected member. He doubted that the Council could take criminal proceedings or had power to do so. 61. Turning to the public interest test, and in particular paragraph 31 of the Decision Notice, the “safe space” argument, this it was contended was ridiculous, as within three or four days it been decided that the suspended employees had no case to answer. There could be no longer any public interest when by 19 April 2018 it was clear that there would be no criminal proceedings. 1262. Turning to the Commissioner’s decision not to give consideration to s.40(2), but noting that the Second Respondent had done so, he did not see how it could do so when a public apology had been made in a blog that went to 5000 employees. This was tantamount to it going in the public domain and was the catalyst for the recent article in the Express and Star. 63. He agreed that the file note was an absolutely key document. 64. In relation to the law cited in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Commissioner’s response to the appeal, he considered that this was an attempt to “retro-fit” the purpose of the investigation into section 30. He did, contrary to what the Commissioner asserted, dispute the application of s.30. 65. In relation to the case of Toms v Informaion Commissioner (EA/2005/0027cited by the Commissioner, he pointed out that civil proceedings would fall under s.31. 66. The Appellant then took the Tribunal through the response of the Council. He made reference to paras. 6 to 8, which he contended were attempts by the Council to discredit him, and his blogging activities. 67. Mr Hopkins, however, made it clear that these were not pursued as grounds of resistance to the appeal. 68. In relation to the Council powers referred to in para. 11 of the response, the Appellant said this was an employment matter, pure and simple. 69. Reliance on s.31 in para. 13 had been “dreamt up” by the Council, when everything had previously been based on s.30. Whilst s.31 was of wider application, there were no criminal or civil proceedings taken. 70. Turning to the Council’s s.40(2) argument, he pointed out that the Commissioner had not made her decision on that basis. Addressing the public issue test, however, he went on to express his concerns about the political leadership at the time, and what he termed the “craven surrender” to it that had occurred. In general terms gossip was rife, the entire Council knew of the suspensions, and everybody knew who the employees been suspended were. They were immediately identifiable. He accepted their right to privacy, but he was not asking for information about them, he was actually fighting for them. 71. He referred to the documents that had been provided to him, some 631 days late, and the individuals identified in them. All this would be in the public domain. He went on to raise concerns as the manner in which the ICO had dealt with the matter, communicating with the Council but not with him. He went through the responses given to the ICO’s enquiries, and to various recently disclosed documents. He did not consider that this documentation 13was complete, there were gaps in it. The list of people involved was growing, and these documents suggest that there are others that have not been disclosed. There was no HR advice, in email form, for example. 72. There was, he submitted, a public interest in not letting a local authority act in this way. It was not satisfactory for the Council to offer a secret report that had been commissioned at public expense. The Second Respondent’s oral submissions. 73. Mr Hopkins for the second respondent made his submissions. He spoke to the written response document. He first of all made it clear that the Council was not relying upon the matters previously raised relating to the Appellant’s blogging activities, or his other FOIA appeals. Whatever the position previously, the focus in this appeal was now upon the Commissioner’s decision, and how it was expressed in the Decision Notice. The Council was not trying to “stitch up” the Appellant, and had not, for example, tried to resist disclosure on s.14 (vexatious request) grounds. That it had considered these issues afresh, and provided the Appellant with more disclosure, showed this. 74. Whilst the Appellant had ranged widely, it was important to see the wood for the trees, and to be alive to the Tribunal’s function to consider the information within the possession of the respondent at time that fell within the scope of the Appellant’s request. 75. There was a small amount of information at issue, which wa, firstly, a file note, which was confirmed (see page 61 the bundle) to have been prepared on 30 January 2018. The second items were the suspension letters, and the third a set of emails, which had recently been disclosed and are at pages 78 to 109 of the second part of the bundle. Very little had in fact been withheld, and such reductions as there had been were uncontentious, and were not disputed to amount to personal data. 76. It was irrelevant that the Second Respondent had not previously relied upon s.31, as caselaw had established several years ago that there could be late reliance upon an exemption not previously advanced by a public authority or relied upon by the Commissioner. 77. Mr Hopkins went on to discuss the s. 30 and s.31 exemptions. He referred to the email at page 97 of the bundle, relating to the suspensions following a “serious information breach”. He submitted that it would be a criminal offence under s.55 of the Data Protection Act to disclose personal data without consent. This would bring the investigation into s.30(1)(c) territory. 78. Moving on to s.31, however, this was something for which a better argument could perhaps be made. It would be wrong to treat these provisions is relating 14only to civil claims or litigation. S.31(2)(b) covered the position precisely. The tribunal was satisfied that the prejudice test would then apply. 79. The focus is the protection of the secretaries who were wrongly suspended in January 2018. They wish to have the matter put behind them and did not want further publicity. They had not consented to disclosure. It was wrong in 2018, and it would be wrong now, to put this material into the public domain. He referred to paragraph 19 of the response, and how the secretaries had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information about their suspension. Without their consent to this data being so processed, a pressing social need will have to be shown, and disclosure would have to be a proportionate means of achieving that need. These employees would suffer if the letters entered into the public domain. 80. The Appellant argues that this information is already public, “the cat is out of the bag”, but that, if anything, was an argument for withholding it and not allowing the Appellant’s request. There would be no point in anonymising the information, the individuals would be readily identifiable, even if their names were omitted from the documents. 81. The emails that had been disclosed relating to the trade union members had been redacted, as had the narrative of what was alleged. This would mean that it was unfair to disclose the personal data of the individuals. 82. Mr Hopkins went on to refer to the witness statement of David Stevens, at paragraph 23, where he states that the matter is now live again and could result in a further investigation. If there was any doubt in January 2018, there was no doubt now, and there could be further disciplinary action (i.e against other persons, not the secretaries). There would be dangers if this information was put into the public domain before any investigation had run its course. There would be a risk of unfairness in any subsequent disciplinary proceedings, and a risk of trial by media. 83. In relation to the “steps discretion”, under s.50 of the FOIA, he took the Tribunal to the relevant case law, but initially invited the Tribunal not to consider it, as if it stood in the shoes of the Council at the time on 31 January 2018, would have been wrong to give the requested information then. 84. He then called David Stevens, whose witness statement is at pages 117 to 121. He is the Interim Chief Executive of the Council and was appointed in mid- 2019. He was not therefore in this post at the time giving rise to the Appellant’s request. His evidence sets out the history of the suspensions and the Appellant’s request in January 2018. 85. On 13 August 2019 he undertook an investigation into this matter, and his statement sets out the enquiries that he made, the independent report that he 15commissioned, and the further documents that came to his attention in the course of this investigation, which were then provided to the Appellant, in redacted form. 86. He apologised on behalf of the Council for the late provision of this information, which was itself the subject to investigation that might require further action. He accepted that there were errors in the process that led to the suspension of the Cabinet secretaries. 87. In paragraph 18 David Stevens states that he has met with all of the Cabinet secretaries, and that they remain very upset by the way that they were treated by the Council. They were distressed by the attention that this matter received in the media. By way of making amends to them, a public apology had been provided on his weekly blog, which went out to all 5000 Council employees. At paragraph 19 he stated that the secretaries did not wish to have any further exposure in relation to this matter and that further disclosure of information relating to it would not be in their interests. Having reiterated in paragraph 21 that the secretaries wanted to put the matter behind them, he expressed his view that to release the information may cause further distress, concern and reputational damage for the secretaries and their families. 88. He went on to say how the matter was still live, and that his investigation could result in action been taken against other Council officers for their conduct during the suspension investigation, and handling of the original request. Public disclosure in the circumstances would be highly prejudicial to this investigation. 89. He went on in paragraph 24 to make the broader point of the need for the Council to have the ability to conduct internal investigations fairly and transparently, with witnesses engaging fully in the process. Public disclosure of such information would be likely to lead to those involved in such investigations being less candid and unwilling to cooperate with the Council which he submitted would be strongly contrary to the public interest. 90. He was cross – examined by the Appellant, and questioned by the Tribunal, in open session. He confirmed that there may be a further investigation which may involve a number of members of staff. When he had first met with the secretaries they were still upset and wanted recognition that they had done nothing wrong. They had had a private apology, which they did not consider enough they wanted colleagues to know that they had done nothing wrong as there was a feeling that there was “no smoke without fire”. 91. He had wanted an independent investigation so that someone could look at the processes as it was clear that the Council did not follow its own processes or procedure, which was indefensible. The secretaries had wanted him to do 16the right thing, and if others had done something wrong they too should face action. 92. The Appellant asked David Stevens if there was an element of dysfunctionality in the Council, and he replied that, when he had been asked to look into this, he realised that the Council had not followed its own processes. 93. He was asked about the documents that had recently been disclosed, and if these been sent to the investigator. He believed that they had, and they would be some of the documents which had been sent to the ICO, along with all the emails that have been obtained which related to the incident. 94. When it was put to him that there was a complete absence of documentation, he said he did not believe that there were any other emails. The suspensions took place over a day or so. He did not believe there were any other emails in relation to them. He would have expected a report, and then an independent officer determining the suspension or making a disciplinary report, but in this instance this did not happen. 95. He was asked about the file note, and it was put to him that by 26 January 2018 it had come to light that none of the secretaries were responsible for the alleged leak. He said he could not say when the trade union representative had made this clear, but it may have been on 26 January. He understood all the circumstances and could answer more in the closed session if necessary. 96. He was referred to pages 88A to 94Aof the open bundle, which was an email from the Union to the Council raising a grievance about the way in which their six members had been treated. 97. Thereafter, the Tribunal went into closed session, which ended the first day of the hearing, which then had to be re-convened The closed material and closed session. 98. The Tribunal viewed the closed material. It cannot, of course, reveal its contents, but suffice it to say that its contents are as contained in the summary of the closed session provided to the Appellant, as follows: The closed session lasted approximately 15 minutes. Mr Hopkins showed the Tribunal the suspension letters. Those letters did not mention possible criminal offences. Mr Hopkins indicated that he did not propose to walk the Tribunal through the redactions made to the email correspondence; the Tribunal could consider those redactions for itself. The Council’s position was that the redacted text should remain withheld because (a) its public disclosure would be unfair to the cabinet secretaries, in revealing further details about what happened to 17them, and/or (b) it was likely to be relevant to the issues under consideration in the live investigation to which Mr Stevens had referred in his open evidence. Mr Hopkins showed the Tribunal the file note. He explained that (as Mr Stevens had explained in open), while the Council was not seeking to defend the process that had been followed in suspending the cabinet secretaries, the file note did explain the chronology, the steps followed and the issues arising in the investigation that had occurred up to 30 January 2018. The Council maintained that this should remain exempt from disclosure, for the reasons given in open. 99. In the closed session argument was advanced as to whether disclosure of the substance of these discussions would assist public understanding of enforcement policy, and the where the balance of public interest would lie. Further Submissions. 100. During the adjournment the Appellant was provided with the “gist” of the closed session, and the second respondent provided him the authority of Birkett v Information Commissioner [2011] EWCA Civ 1606, which confirmed the Decision of the Upper Tribunal ([2011] UKUT 39 (AAC)) which was cited as authority for the proposition that on appeal this Tribunal is not confined to the reasons upon which the public authority relied, or the Commissioner relied in making her Decision, but may find alternative grounds for its own Decision. 101. The Appellant, in the resumed hearing, conceded this proposition, whilst, of course, urging the Tribunal not to accede to the Second Respondent’s invitation to take this approach. 102. The parties then made their final submissions. Mr Hopkins concluded his for the Second Respondent. He explained the “steps discretion”, and the caselaw in support of it, as the alternative position that the Council would take. 103. He referred to the s.40(2) exemption first and referred to David Stevens’ evidence. The reasons relied upon were even more cogent now, the investigation was continuing. He also referred to the fact that the withheld material would also reveal the trade union membership of the secretaries in question, which would be considered sensitive personal data. 104. He then went on to consider the s.30 and s.31 exemptions. The Commissioner had accepted the s.30 exemption, but the Second Respondent had not majored on it. If the Commissioner had got it wrong, the Tribunal could substitute a decision on the basis of s.40(2). 18105. Alternatively, the Tribunal could find that the s.31 exemption was made out. He took the Appellant’s point that this was not the exemption relied on, but he cited Birkett as authority for the power that the Tribunal had to do this. The Second Respondent was relying on s.31(1)(g), not (h). The investigation was into improper conduct suspected on the part of the secretaries. 106. The exemption did not apply only during the currency of the investigation, it lasted after it. The purpose of the exemption, the “safe space” argument, would be defeated if at some later stage the material could become public. In any event, this investigation was not over, it was ongoing, given more recent events. 107. In due course, after an adjournment, Mr Hopkins conceded that he could not resist the appeal in relation to the s.30 ground relied upon. 108. The Appellant’s final submissions addressed firstly, what he termed the “dreamt up” s.31 exemption. He argued that it was not engaged, as the Guidance cases are all on policy decisions, and not about specific investigations. He referred to London Borough of Camden v The Information Commissioner & Yiannis Voyias [2012] UKUT 190 (ACC) referred to in the Commissioner’s Guidance. 109. He argued that the Council had to prove that to release the information would prejudice the investigation. 110. He referred to the Decisions in Alan Digby – Cameron v Information Commissioner and Bedford Police and Hartfordshire Police [EA/2008/0023 & 0025] and Toms v Information Commissioner [EA/2005/0027] where this exemption had been considered. He pointed out that it could be in the public interest to disclose where the investigation had not been conducted properly. 111. He referred to the late disclosure of the further material. It was important to know what the withheld file note did not contain, as well as what it did. The Union’s involvement was apparent from the open material. Their request for reinstatement would then be dealt with in confidential meetings, of which there would be no file note. 112. He went on to reference the need for disclosure to expose inadequate investigations, citing the Commissioner’s Guidance, this time in relation to s.30, in relation to the Jeremy Thorpe trial (Guardian Newspapers Ltd v Information Commissioner and CC Avon and Somerset Police [EA/2006/0017] ). 113. He then turned to the s.40(2) exemption. His request had been about Council managers, not the individuals who were suspended. He had never asked for the suspension letters. The Judge did, at this juncture, point out the terms of para. 3 of his request. He replied that it should be read in the context 19of the opening paragraphs, which refer to managers. He did not want to impinge upon any junior employees’ rights, or the data protection rights of the secretaries. 114. He referred to paras. 99 to 101 of the Commissioner’s Guidance, headed “Prejudice to Investigations”. There had to come a point at which, after months, the risk of prejudice to an investigation was negligible. Only real risk had to be considered, not fanciful risk, as the Guidance pointed out. 115. He had not sought sensitive data and had only been maintaining the proper public interest in ensuring that proper procedures had been followed, to re-assure staff and the public. He reiterated that much was already in the public domain, there was a lot of gossip, and hundreds of employees knew about the matter, which then was in the Press. 116. He made reference to page 25 of the Commissioner’s Guidance on s.40, (“Private v Public Life”) , and how there had been an intrusion into the private lives of the secretaries when this all happened. They had not invited it. Here was, he said, no evidence of the secretaries not wanting disclosur, prior to the Decision Notice. 117. Now, 18 months later the Council had been picking and choosing what it would disclose, had made the public apology and had expected there would be leaks (he referred to p.94 of the bundle). The secretaries may now say they do not want disclosure, but should they too be allowed to pick and choose in this way? The Law. 118. The relevant provisions of FOIA and other legislation are set out in full in Annexe A to this Decision. Discussion and Findings. a.)The s.40(2) exemption. 119. Whilst the Council and the Commissioner have approached this request initially from the standpoint of s.30 or s.31, the Tribunal differs from them by preferring first to consider the personal data exemption under s.40(2). As will be apparent, much the same considerations arise, when applying the public interest test under both exemptions, but the Tribunal considers that the employees’ private personal data protection rights are as important, if not more so, than the wider, more public, interests that the Council seeks to protect under s.31. 20117. In approaching this issue, once it is accepted, as is clear, that the information requested is personal data, the question then arises as to whether it can be released, or whether to do so would breach the data protection principles. The principles engaged are those now to be found in the GDPR in Articles 5 and 6, set out in the Annexe to this Decision. Article 6(f) is particularly relevant : (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data …”. 118. The GDPR, however, came into force on 25 May 2018, shortly after the request in this appeal. Consequently, the provisions of the DPA 1998 apply, and in particular Schedule 2, which at para. 6(1), is similarly worded: “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party, or parties to whom the data is disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of the prejudice to the rights or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 119. It is to be noted that the word used is “necessary”. Necessary is a strong word, it means more than just “desirable” or “advantageous to”. It suggests that without the information the requester would either be prevented from, or seriously hampered in pursuing any of the legitimate interests referred to. As is clear, the Appellant has not been prevented from, or hampered in his holding to account the actions of the Council in suspending, and then reinstating, the secretaries in question. There has been considerable public debate about this, including upon the Appellant’s own blog. The basic facts are known, and it is difficult to see what more of any significant value is likely be added by the release of the personal data that the Appellant seeks. 120. The Appellant argues that the information is already in the public domain, citing in particular the apology made to the relevant employees in the blog from David Stevens in August 2019. That may be so, but the evidence of David Stevens, which the Tribunal has no reason to doubt, is that the secretaries have told him that they do not want this data released. What the Appellant seems not to appreciate is the difference between release of this some of this data, the basic facts of their suspensions, for limited purposes to a limited audience (i.e the secretaries requiring a public apology made for their colleagues in the Council to see) , and release of the totality of the personal data held in relation to this matter to the world in general, and for ever. 121. There is a difference between the fact of their suspensions and their identification as the persons who were suspended, and the actual personal 21data contained in the documentation that the Appellant seeks. The latter is likely to go further, of course, than the former. 122. There is an obvious course open to the Appellant, which he has not taken, and that is to seek the consent of the individuals (any one or more of them) to release of this personal data. Whilst he has argued that by the requirement for the public apology that has now been given, they have somehow given that consent, or waived their data protection rights, he cannot demonstrate that they or any of them, have consented to their personal data being processed in this way. 123. David Stevens’ evidence was that they would be distressed and upset if this request were to be acceded to, wanting, as they do to put this matter behind them, which the Tribunal accepts. That factor, together with the absence of any real impediment to the pursuit by the Appellant of the interests of accountability and transparency in which he is engaged, satisfies the Tribunal that the balancing exercise falls in favour of non – disclosure. That this may, as the Appellant would see it, enable the Council to shelter behind the interests of the secretaries, be a consequence of this approach, is indeed correct, but it arises because of the primacy of the individuals’ personal data protection rights in these circumstances. The Tribunal would accordingly allow the appeal, but substitute an alternative Decision Notice, maintaining this exemption, on that basis. b.The s.30/31 exemptions. 124. The first question that this aspect of the appeal raised was whether s.30 applied, could the Council rely upon its provisions? The Tribunal’s provisional view was that it could not, and the Council, and then the Commissioner, misapplied these provisions. The reason they did so, was a misunderstanding of the actual purpose of the creation of the data in question. Whilst prosecution was a possibility, the Tribunal is quite satisfied that it was a remote one, and not in the mind of the Council at the time. The provisions of s.30 apply to criminal investigations, not to anything else. The fact that nothing in the open or the closed material makes any reference whatsover to potential criminal proceedings demonstrates that this section is not engaged. The Second Respondent conceded, in closing submission, that this exemption could not succeed. The First Respondent, of course, has not made any such concession, so the Tribunal has to determine the matter. As will be apparent, the Tribunal considers that the appeal on this basis should succeed. 125. The Tribunal’s view, however, is that s.31 is indeed engaged. The Council were under a duty to investigate possible breach of confidentiality on the part of its employees. That may have led to disciplinary action, after the suspensions that it clearly did lead to. 22126. With respect to the Commissioner and the Council whose argument this initially was, they have both been somewhat confused as to the role and relevance of the Employment Rights Act 1996. That Act does not confer any “power” to conduct an investigation, or any requirement to do so. Investigation is almost invariably a pre – requisite for a dismissal to be found to be fair under the provisions of s.98 of that Act, but the Act itself confers no powers or even specific duties to conduct such investigations. 127. The power to do so, the Tribunal considers, is derived from the Council’s duties as an employer, and its general powers to carry out those duties for the purposes for which it exists, the administration of the local authority functions that it carries out. Section 1 of the Localism Act 2011 contains such powers. 128. The Council’s written submission is a little misconceived too, when, at para. 11, reference is again made to the Employment Rights Act 1996, and how unfair treatment may lead to “constructive unfair dismissal”. That is so, but it has nothing to do with the power that the Council was exercising when it suspended, and then reinstated the employees in question. Their suspected conduct may have led to actual, not constructive dismissals (which would have required resignations on the part of the employees) , which may in turn have led to claims of unfair dismissal under the Act. Equally, and perhaps more pertinently, regardless of any Employment Tribunal proceedings, which would have to have been instituted by any affected employee, the Council, faced with suspected breaches of confidentiality, was entitled to consider taking proceedings itself, in the High or County Court against the relevant employees in which injunctive relief may have been sought. There is, however, no evidence it actually did have such proceedings in mind when conducting what was described (para.15 of the Council’s response, page 34 of the bundle) as “an internal and preliminary investigation”. 129. The Council was, we are satisfied, exercising its powers and functions as an employer, and s.31(1)(g) was engaged. In relation to the functions set out in s.31(2), these are wide ranging and include at s.31(2)(a), investigations for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law. “The “law” includes civil as well as criminal legal obligations, and in this case, it is arguable that the investigation was to ascertain whether the secretaries had broken their legal duty of confidentiality. That said, we must bear in mind that it is the purpose in the mind of the Council that we must examine, and whilst we have expressly discounted that the purpose of potential criminal proceedings was in the contemplation of the Council at the time, we could equally question whether the purpose truly was to ascertain if any person had actually broken the (civil) law. Rather, if the investigation did not fall truly under s.31(2)(a), it clearly would fall under s.31(2)(b), i.e it was to ascertain if any person was responsible for conduct which was improper, such as leaking confidential information. Either way, s.31 is, in our view, engaged. 23We are satisfied that to disclose the requested information would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of the function of the Council to conduct such investigations. 130. Having made that finding, s.31 too providing only a qualified exemption (s.2(3) of the FOIA), the Tribunal has then had to consider the public interest test. In doing so, in part, the same considerations really apply as apply under the public interest test for the purposes of s.40(2) above, in relation to the personal data interests of the secretaries. Additionally there are the other, wider , interests relied upon by the Council in support of the contention that data obtained in the course of such investigations should be exempt , because of the likely effect upon such investigations of the potential for subsequent release into the public domain upon the willingness with which , or the manner in which, persons involved participate in, or carry out, such investigations. The Tribunal accepts that too as a weighty point, militating against disclosure. 131. Again, the Appellant has not been able to demonstrate how the absence of these particular, and rather limited, pieces of data have impeded his ability to pursue the legitimate interests he seeks to advance, and for all these reasons, the Tribunal, having found s.31 was engaged , is satisfied that the public interest test falls against disclosure. 132. As will be appreciated, the Tribunal has upheld these exemptions, but on different grounds, and has relied upon the authority of Birkett v Information Commissioner [2011] EWCA Civ 1606 as entitling it to do so. Whilst not cited by Mr Hopkins, Birkett was approved, and cited by a three Judge Upper Tribunal in Information Commissioner v Malnick and the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments [2018 UKUT 72 (AAC) (see para. 102 in particular). In the circumstances, the Tribunal has not considered the “steps discretion” advanced in the alternative by the Second Respondent. 133. The appeal is accordingly allowed, as the Commissioner’s Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. We, however, uphold the exemption in respect of the requested information on two alternative bases, and accordingly substitute a Decision Notice in those terms. Our decision is unanimous.

"710","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0365 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Jean Nelson and Malcolm Clarke Heard at Leeds Magistrates’ Court, 18 February 2020 Between Andrew Dickinson Appellant and The Information Commissioner Respondent The Appellant represented himself The Commissioner was not represented 1DECISION AND REASONS Background 1. The Appellant made a request of the City of York Council (‘the Council’) on 18 February 2019 in the following terms:- Can you send me the advice given to [named councillor] referenced in the email below please. Can you also provide me with all formal and informal advice offered to councillors who sit on the planning committee with regard to meeting members of the public. 2. The background to the request was that the Appellant had written to the councillor named in the request (who sits on the planning committee of the Council) asking for a meeting to discuss concerns about a planning matter. She responded, on 14 February 2019, to say that she had taken advice and would not be taking up the invitation to meet, and that it would not usually be appropriate for members of the planning committee to meet either applicants or objectors ‘to avoid any charges of bias’. The Appellant queried this and the councillor responded to say that ‘the advice has always been that meeting developers or objectors outside the formal committee process should be treated with great caution’. She said that on this occasion she spoke to the ‘Ass Director’, which we take to mean ‘Assistant Director’ (perhaps of the Planning Department). 3. The Council refused to respond to the request on the basis that it was manifestly unreasonable for the purposes of regulation 12(4)(b) EIR. The basis for this was that the request would require an unreasonable diversion of resources from the Council’s core activities. The decision notice 4. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner, and the Commissioner’s decision notice is dated 30 September 2019. The Commissioner thought that the circumstances of this case were very similar to the request considered 2previously by her in a decision notice dated 29 March 2019. In that decision the Commissioner agreed with the Council that the request by this Appellant for ‘rules’ given to councillors about contact with members of the public in planning matters was manifestly unreasonable. We note a major reason for that decision appears to be the acceptance by the Commissioner of the Council’s position that the Appellant knew at time of his request that no rules had been issued or existed. In the present case the Commissioner concludes that, likewise, the Appellant could ‘have anticipated that no recorded information was likely to be held’ (paragraph 35). This seems to be based, largely, on the fact that the councillor said that she had spoken to the Assistant Director who gave her advice (paragraph 33), and presumably the Appellant was expected to deduce from that, that nothing had been recorded as information. Therefore, the Commissioner concluded that the request was manifestly unreasonable. The hearing 5. At the hearing the Appellant represented himself and no other party attended the hearing or was represented. The Appellant told us that he was concerned about unfairness in the planning decision-making process. His view was that council planning officers often discussed applications with developers but were less likely to liaise with objectors or individuals. He thought it was important that councillors on the planning committee should meet local people and discuss their concerns about planning applications. He was aggrieved that councillors routinely declined to meet with him, and he pointed to local and national guidance that at least suggested that such meetings could take place without the objectivity and independence of councillors on the planning committee being compromised. As to this guidance he pointed to the Plain English guide to the Planning System issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government in January 2015 (and see page 30 of the bundle) which states:- 38. Local people should take the lead in shaping their neighbourhoods and elected councillors have a key leadership role in this process. The role of councillors in district, county or single tier councils will vary depending on whether they sit on the planning committee (which makes decisions on planning applications) or not. However, all councillors have a role to play in representing the views and aspirations of residents in plan-making and when planning applications affecting their ward are being considered. 9. Changes in the Localism Act 2011 clarified the ability of councillors to be able to discuss matters which may relate to a planning application prior to voting on that application at committee, as long as they can show that they are going to make their judgement on the application with an open mind, listening to all the evidence and not having pre-determined their decision 6. In addition the Council has issued a Code of Good Practice for Councillors involved in the Planning Process dated November 2016, which is also referred to in the bundle for this hearing. The relevant part of this reads:- 6.1 In order for the planning system to work effectively public concerns must be adequately aired. It is an important part of a Member’s role to listen to residents’ views and put these views forward within the Council. However, it is important that Members of the Planning Committees make decisions based on the full facts having considered all representations made and all other relevant considerations. Members will usually need a report from officers to help them to do this. 6.2 Members of a Planning Committee should be wary of giving the impression that they have made up their mind about a particular matter. Discretion is always advisable. A good approach is to say something like: “From what I know at the moment I support (or have reservations about) this application, but I won’t make a final decision until I have all the facts before me at Planning Committee”. 7. The Appellant accepted that he had been told in the course of the previous request that there was no guidance or rules which prevented councillors speaking with objectors, but explained that that was not the focus of the 4current request, which had come about because a councillor had told him she had been given advice on the issue from a senior council official. The Appellant was aware that the advice may not have been given in writing, but if it was then he asked for its disclosure. Having been told by one councillor that she had received advice, the Appellant had also asked for disclosure of any other advice of the same kind that may have been given to other councillors. The Law 8. In this case there is no dispute that the information sought in this case is ‘environmental information’ as defined in regulation 2 of the EIR. 9. Regulation 5 of the EIRs obliges a public authority that holds environmental information to make it available on request, subject to other provisions of the EIRs. Regulation 12 of the EIRs provides, insofar as relevant: “(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if– (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. (3) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that– …. (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable”. 510. In relation to the guidance on the law, the Upper Tribunal in Vesco v (1) Information Commissioner and (2) Government Legal Department [2019] UKUT 247 (AAC) underlined the importance of access to environmental information to enable people to participate in decisions about the environment. The UT explained that:- 13… These public participation obligations arise under the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental matters (“Aarhus”), which led to adoption of the Directive. The EIRs are part of the UK’s implementation of its obligations under the Directive. The EIRs fall to be interpreted purposively in accordance with the Directive (Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA Case C-106/89 paragraph 8; The A-G for the Prince of Wales v Information Commissioner and Mr Michael Bruton [2016] UKUT 154 paragraph 15). 14. It is clear from the extracts from the Directive set out in the governing legislation section above that the purposes of the Directive include guaranteeing rights to access environmental information. Public authorities hold information on behalf of the public, and are to support and assist the public in seeking access to information. As the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) has said: “The right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information only in a few specific and clearly defined cases. The grounds for refusal should therefore be interpreted restrictively, in such a way that the public interest served by disclosure is weighed against the interest served by the refusal”. (Office for Communications v Information Commissioner Case C-71/10 at paragraph 22). 11. At paragraph 16 of the UT decision it is explained that it is important that all of the tests in the EIRs are applied before a public authority decides to refuse to disclose information and that ‘[i]t is clear from the terms of the Directive and CJEU authority that grounds for refusal of requests for environmental information must be interpreted restrictively’. The UT then sets out the tests to be applied:- 6….For public authorities to be entitled to refuse a request for environmental information on the basis that it is manifestly unreasonable, a three stage test applies, on the wording of Regulation 12: Is the request manifestly unreasonable? (Regulation 12(1)(a)) If so, does the public interest in maintaining the exception outweigh the public interest in disclosing the information, in all the circumstances of the case? (Regulation 12(1)(b)) Does the presumption in favour of disclosure mean that the information should be disclosed? (Regulation 12(2)) 12. In relation to whether the request is manifestly unreasonable, the UT explained at paragraph 17 that it is helpful to set out the guidance from the UT in full in relation to all three stages:- 17. …The starting point is whether the request has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public, judged objectively (Dransfield v Information Commissioner [2015] 1 WLR 5316 at paragraph 68, Beggs v Information Commissioner 2019 SLT 173 paragraphs 26-29). The hurdle of satisfying the test is a high one. In considering manifest unreasonableness, it may be helpful to consider factors set out by the Upper Tribunal in Dransfield v Information Commissioner and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440 at paragraph 28. These are: (1) the burden (on the public authority and its staff), since one aim of the provision is to protect the resources of the public authority being squandered; (2) the motive of the applicant - although no reason has to be given for the request, it has been found that motive may be relevant: for example a malicious motive may point to vexatiousness, but the absence of a malicious motive does not point to a request not being vexatious (Beggs, paragraph 33); (3) the value or serious purpose of the request; (4) the harassment or distress of staff. 13. The UT also commented that this is not an exhaustive checklist. Discussion and reasons 714. We agree with the Appellant that this request is not the same as the recent request covered by the Information Commissioner’s decision notice in March 2019. 15. In that case the Appellant asked for any rules which were relevant to the question as to whether councillors on the planning committee should speak to objectors. He had already been told that no rules or guidance existed, and on that basis it is understandable that the Commissioner agreed with the Council that the request was manifestly unreasonable. 16. This appeal deals with a different matter. The Appellant was told by a councillor that she had sought advice from an Assistant Director within the Council and, as a result of that advice, had decided not to meet with the Appellant. The Appellant has asked for that advice to be disclosed. 17. It is not the case, in our view and contrary to the view of the Commissioner, that he can anticipate that the information is likely not to be held. It is true that the councillor says that she ‘spoke to’ the Assistant Director. But it seems not unlikely that either the councillor of the Assistant Director made a note of the advice given (or received), or that the councillor is making reference to a conversation by email (or via another platform). In our view the factual basis for finding that the previous request was manifestly unreasonable simply is not applicable to the present request. 18. In this case, we note that the national and local guidance referred to above does not prevent councillors on the planning committee speaking to members of the public about planning applications, and indeed indicates that this may be appropriate in some circumstances, and it is valid to ask for information about advice given to councillors on the issue, especially when one councillor states that she has, indeed, sought and received advice. In our view there is a reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the Appellant and to the public or a section of the public, so that the Appellant and others know what is being said to councillors about the issue. 819. We note that the hurdle of satisfying the ‘manifestly unreasonable’ test is a high one. We bear in mind the limited nature of the Appellant’s request, the genuine motive of the Appellant to be able to participate more fully in planning and environmental issues, and value of the request which we have addressed above. 20. In relation to the councillor who communicated with the Appellant it will be a simple matter for the Council to acknowledge whether it holds the information or not. If it does hold the information then there may be exemptions upon which it wishes to rely to support non-disclosure, but that is not a matter for this Tribunal. It seems to us that responding to the first part of the request will not be onerous. 21. In relation to the second part of the request, which relates to similar advice provided to other councillors, the Council has not advanced any arguments as to what work might be entailed in responding, and the Commissioner has not made a decision that the breadth of the request is an issue. Given the wording of the request, our initial thoughts are that this would entail asking members of the planning committee at the time of the request, whether they have a record of advice received on the issue, and maybe identifying individual officers (like the Assistant Director) who may have given such advice. 22. Taking account of all these factors, again bearing in mind that the reg 12(4)(b) EIR exemption should be interpreted restrictively, we do not find that either part of the request, or the request as a whole, is manifestly unreasonable. 23. Having reached that conclusion, we do not need to consider the public interest test. However, it seems to us that there is a public interest in the public being aware of the basis upon which advice is given to councillors not to discuss planning issues with members of the public. 924. We understand that the Council may feel some frustration with the Appellant, and may be of the view that it has been made clear to him that it is felt generally that it is not a good idea for members of the planning committee to meet objectors and members of the public prior to a planning committee decision. However, we also note the presumption in favour of disclosure, which in our view has not been rebutted in this case by this frustration, where there has been a reference to specific advice having been provided. 25. As a result of our decision, the appeal is upheld and the Council will need to respond to the Appellant’s requests on the basis that they are not manifestly unreasonable.

"810","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal EA/2019/0347 (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights BETWEEN: ROBERT LATIMER APPELLANT and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER RESPONDENT HEARING: Wednesday 12 February 2020, at Newcastle Upon Tyne Magistrates Court: PANEL: Brian Kennedy QC, Anne Chafer and Jean Nelson. Appearances: Mr Robert Latimer for the Appellant: Result: Appeal allowed. DECISION Introduction: [1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”) as modified by rule 18 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”). The appeal is against the decision of the 1Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice dated 21 August 2019 (reference FER0826020), which is a matter of public record. [2] The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat to consider this case on 12 February 2020 and have allowed the appeal. Factual Background to this Appeal: [3] Full details of the background to this appeal, Mr Latimer’s request for information and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice (“DN”) and not repeated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether Mr Latimer’s requests for information relating to the sewerage treatment system in Sunderland, in particular in Whitburn, were manifestly unreasonable. CHRONOLOGY: 1992 Information to local residents from Northumbrian Water (“NW”) re Whitburn storm water pumping system in Sunderland. 1999 Appellant is advised as to spill rate and tunnel capacity at Whitburn 2001 Public Inquiry re frequency of spills at Whitburn, at which Appellant was present and received information in Inquiry Bundle 2003 European Commission (“EC”) issues warning to UK re violations of Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 2006 EC final warning to UK in Reasoned Opinion 23 Nov 2007 Appellant requests information from Environment Agency (“EA”) regarding Hendon sewerage treatment works 17 Feb 2009 Commissioner upholds EA’s refusal of the request as manifestly unreasonable 3 Aug 2009 Refusal upheld by First Tier Tribunal re Hendon 8 Sept 2009 Appellant requests discharge and flow records re Whitburn and Briardene stations 25 Sept 2009 EA discloses information re Briardene as this was a new issue raised but refuses re Whitburn 226 Jan 2012 Appellant receives opinion of Advocate General to the EC suggesting a disparity in figures presented for flow rates in discharge consent 14 Feb 2012 EA confirmed it would not respond to Appellant’s on-going requests about Sunderland’s sewerage system. Appellant turns to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) with correspondence regarding flow rates at Whitburn 16 April 2012 DEFRA provides explanation as to disparity, suggesting a misunderstanding of its data provided to the Court on the part of the Advocate General 10 Sept 2012 Appellant requests all information, correspondence, consents etc. regarding four sewerage systems, Whitburn and three in Sunderland from EA 16 Oct 2012 EA provides some information regarding Whitburn but refuses the rest as manifestly unreasonable 18 Oct 2012 ECJ decision in Commission v UK (C-301/10) finds that the UK breached the Waste Water Directive at Whitburn 6 Nov 2012 Appellant complains to ICO and FTT that he had been treated unfairly in relation to his previous case 11 April 2013 Commissioner upholds EA’s refusal of October 2012 as manifestly unreasonable 8 May 2013 Appellant appeals to FTT 4 Sept 2013 Refusal upheld by FTT re Whitburn. (FTT only upheld the Manifestly unreasonable finding in relation to the Sunderland sewage system). 14 June 2015 Request for information re Whitburn to Northumbrian Water 9 July 2015 NW refuses request under r12(4)(b) as manifestly unreasonable (11 Feb 2016, IC upholds NW refusal of July 2015 as manifestly unreasonable). 30 Aug 2016 Refusal upheld by FTT 15 Jan 2019 Present request for information regarding consent to sewage discharge levels at Whitburn 12 Feb 2019 EA refuses request as vexatious, citing FER0230659 Appellant requests internal review 13 March 2019 Review upholds refusal 24 Sept 2015 Appellant complains to Commissioner 321 May 2019 EC Notice to Members re Appellant’s petition regarding Whitburn confirms on-going monitoring but notes repeated engagement with Appellant to try to confine his correspondence to matters with the EC’s purview RELEVANT LEGISLATION Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information 12.(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if – (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. [4] To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. [5] For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that – (a) it does not hold that information when an applicant’s request is received; (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable; (c) the request for information is formulated in too general a manner and the public authority has complied with regulation 9; (d) the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data; or (e) the request involves the disclosure of internal communications. COMMISSIONER’S DECISION NOTICE: [6] The Commissioner set out some background to the Appellant’s requests, and also some information provided by the EA regarding steps it has taken to improve the system at Whitburn and Roker in Sunderland. It also explained that as well as multiple requests on the same theme; the Appellant had previously made a complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman about the EA’s actions in Sunderland that had not been 4upheld. The Commissioner described the Appellant’s pursuit of information on this subject to show an “unreasonable persistence” and an “obsessive quality”, and any serious purpose to the request had been diminished by the fact that it had “already been answered”. The requests therefore were manifestly unreasonable by virtue of being vexatious, and the public interest lay in refusing the request. NOTICE OF APPEAL: [7] The Appellant described the impact of the Whitburn storm water system on the coastline near his house since 1996, complaining of foul smells and “sewage debris coming ashore”. He accepted having made various requests for information about this issue over the years to DEFRA, EA, Northumbrian Water, the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, the European Commission and the UNECE Aarhus Convention Secretariat, but stated that this was the fault of the intransigence of the EA and the Commissioner. The Attorney General’s Opinion to the ECJ judgment suggested that the flow rates for the Whitburn system as described to the Court were not the same as described to the public inquiry in 2001. The Appellant’s most recent request has emanated from this disparity and he maintained was not a repeat of earlier requests. [8] The Appellant went on to argue that the discharge and flow rates provided by the EA are misleading, false or in breach of the waste permit. He accused the Commissioner of “making a mockery of the whole EIR process”, of ignoring previous Tribunal directions and of existing to ensure that the public could not obtain information. He noted that the Tribunal’s decision in 2009 explicitly stated that the EA could not refuse the Applicant’s requests for new information, as opposed to information already covered in the appeal. The Appellant stated that as that appeal related to the Hendon sewerage system and not the Whitburn pumping system, the refusal of the request was inappropriate. [9] The Commissioner then sought an extension of time to lodge her response. The Appellant stated that the Commissioner’s use of a legal representative to provide a response was evidence of her bias in favour of public authorities, and said it was of great concern to him “unless his/her knowledge is greater than mine on engineering calculations which I assumed this case is all about”. He argued that this made it more 5difficult to present his case to the Tribunal, and the public interest lay in disclosing the material given the public expenditure on the sewerage systems. He also stated that there was no need to instruct any legal representatives if the Commissioner were to order disclosure. The Appellant lodged further documents to demonstrate that his complaints had a serious purpose. COMMISSIONER’S REPLY: [10] The Commissioner relied upon the Dransfield and Craven definitions of vexatiousness, emphasising the need for a holistic approach to the determination. In this instance, the Appellant is using the EIR “to continue a campaign on an issue that, on an objective view, has been addressed by the relevant public bodies over a prolonged period”. In the context of his previous requests, the Appellant has been “unreasonably persistent” in making a high amount of frequent and similar requests to the EA which, have resulted in a disproportionate burden and diversion of the EA’s time and resources. The public interest lies in protecting the authority from the Appellant’s ‘misuse’ of the EIR. APPELLANT’S RESPONSE: [11] The Appellant expressed that he was aggrieved that the appeal concerned the Commissioner’s handling of his complaint rather than his request for information. He submitted many further documents and items of correspondence to the Tribunal. He accused the Commissioner of bias, of presenting untruths, of ignoring the “instruction” of the FTT in 2009 not to refuse other requests, and of having “lost their way” in regards to the EIR. He accused the Commissioner of failing to take proper consideration of the holistic approach required in Dransfield, and denied that Dransfield or Craven had any relevance to his case. He reiterated his submissions about the spill rate of the system and the capacity of the interceptor tunnel being at odds with previous stated figures and repeated that the public interest was on the side of the exposing official wrongdoing and protecting the residents of Whitburn. HEARING: 6[12] The Appellant made lengthy but comprehensive submissions and presented as a reasonable and conscientious citizen with a significant concern and serious purpose for public health and safety issues in pollution problems and risks in the Whitburn and wider areas. With Reference to the Respondents Response to his Grounds of Appeal, he dealt with many points raised inter-alia the following under the heading “FACTUAL BACKGROUND” at page 71 on in the Open Bundle before us. ; [13] He agrees with Para 21. At Para 22 he notes that he first wrote in 1998 about the system that as commissioned in 1996. He agrees with Para 23 and 24 and added some 300 items of sewage were found on the coast as a result of the system and this was reported resulting in a fine. He agreed Para 25 and indicated that this Public Inquiry came about as a result of his complaint about the smell of sewage etc. In relation to Para 26 the Appellant indicates that the EU does not have investigative powers of it own. He sent them a report from the Secretary of State’s Public Inquiry by Margaret Beckett. Then EU investigators sought assistance from the Appellant in obtaining further information, which is what the Appellant was seeking to do. He agrees with Para 27. In relation to Para 28 he agrees with the content but points out that the system at Hendon is a treatment sewage works. It is different from Whitburn, which is a storm pump network. He points out that there is no mention of Whitburn as the request in issue in the subject request referred to was Hendon not Whitburn. He agrees with the content of Para 29 and points out that the subject request of this appeal was a new request, on this occasion about Whitburn. He also agrees with the contents of Para 30 pointing out that Whitburn and Briardene pumping stations are two sister schemes (not sewage works as in Hendon) and this request was as a result of the EU personnel asking him to seek information. He agrees with Para 31 adding that this request was “New” in so far as it related to information concerning Whitburn. The subject request of this appeal was not for the same information he had sought in the past. 7The appellant refutes the contents of Para 32 and stated that the only information he received over this period was from DEFRA and it conflicted with any information provided by EA who did not want to help. The appellant agrees with Para 33 and expressed the view that it was vindication of his concerns. He explained that he had almost given up until this Opinion from the Advocate General was provided. He agrees Para’s 34, 35, 36 and 37 adding the DEFRA came back and confirmed indicated some information provided to him had been wrong. He points out that Para 38 is wrong as it was not Sunderland and should have been Whitburn. He agrees with Para 39 and Para 40 but refers us to two important letters at Pages 117 & 118 of the Open Bundle before the Tribunal, which he says raised maters of serious concern to him and the general public both of a significant sewage overflow at Whitburn and that the Whitburn Steel pumping station has been operating even when there is no recorded local rainfall. The appellant refers also to Page 116 of the Open Bundle, (“OB”) which raised cause for significant concern. The appellant agrees with Para 41, which he points out raises a serious concern from DEFRA as a result of which he acted on their request and wrote to the EA, for this “new” information, who refused the information on the basis that it was “Manifestly Unreasonable”. On Para 42 he agrees and adds it includes Whitburn and was the request he had been asked to make by DEFRA. He agrees with Para 43 but points out again that it was not Sunderland but Whitburn. He agrees Paras; 44, 45 and 46 but does not accept the suggestion of the Public Interest in maintaining the exception and favouring non- disclosure. In relation to the rest of the Paragraphs from 45 to 49 the Appellant simply states he continues to see chronic sewage disposals on the beach at Whitburn and his focus has slipped but that the whole debacle is disgraceful. DEFRA he says had suggested he inquire further and the EU bodies involved had not accepted an error had been made and also suggested he make further requests for Information. He asks, “Why I am having to do the work of the EA?”. He refers us to and reads the correspondence on pages 88, 89, 92, 93 & 94 of the OB. 8[14] THE REQUEST and PUBLIC INTEREST: a) In relation to the Request the appellant refers us to Para 50 and states he had never previously asked about this specific change’ and had never previously asked for “ . . . .a copy of the discharge consent that allows the CSOs spill at 4.5 XDWF ? .. “’ He insists this is the First time he has asked that question precisely and has never had an answer. It is, he points out, an important query in relation to responsibility for sewage spillage in the area of Whitburn and a proper request for information that the Public Authority in this case should properly respond to by disclosure of all relevant information they have. The Appellant agrees with PARA 56 PAGE 77 which supports his point. He agrees also that he has been writing about similar concerns over many years now but the problem of chronic sewage spillage in his and neighbouring areas persists and he has not received answers or information as to causation and responsibility. He refutes entirely the contents of Para. 59 on page 77 of the OB. He insist his concerns are not of his personal interest alone but of interest to all residents in the area and he specifically refutes that the relevant Public Authorities concerned have addressed the issues of concern to the public at large. b) In relation to matters pertaining to the Public Interest balance, the Appellant refers us to inter-alia, a number of matters. The appellant indicates that there are chronic and serious problems with sewage spillage at the works he has sought information on, in a number of areas including Whitburn. The relevant public authorities are failing to address these problems. If the information sought was provided, he and others can demonstrate why and how the situation can be improved. He informs us that the 2011 census figures for Whitburn declare a population of 5,270 and the number of dwellings 2376. He is a member of the Whitburn Neighbourhood Forum, which has been designated as a recognised statutory body and they represent the interests of circa 5,000 villagers. The appellant went to great length to explain to the Tribunal how and why the Whitburn Forum was formed, what its purpose was. One of the areas of concern to the Forum is the need for the provision of 3,000 houses in the South Tyneside Council area, of which 397 will be in Whitburn, 400 in Cleadon and 1,000 in Boldon, all of which drain into the Whitburn Storm drain and the Hendon sewage system. . The chronic sewage spillage problem in the three areas of concern has never been properly addressed. Whitburn residents are all affected. This is not a matter where the 9Appellant is on a personal crusade. He happens to be an engineer who can articulate the dire need for action and can identify precisely the cause of the damage to the environment. He is a spokesperson for the community. The Forum have made a request for information also and have been refused on the basis that the Appellant is named as a member. The residents of Whitburn need another sewage/storm drain treatment system. What they have there at present was only built for flood protection from excess rain. See inter-alia; OB Pages. 88, 89, 92, 93, & 94. CONCLUSION: [15] The Appellant attended the Tribunal hearing. The Respondent relied on the papers in the Open Bundle (“OB”) before the Tribunal and in particular the Decision Notice itself and the substantive Response to the Grounds of Appeal. The Tribunal found the Appellant to be a reasonable, articulate and conscientious individual who presented his submissions in a competent, coherent and comprehensive manner. As an engineer he was able to explain to us the detail of concerns he has had for many years. He describes how despite years of effort the citizens of Whitburn and beyond have been deprived of suitable water treatment facilities. He feels he has come to the end of the line. He does not dispute that he has received assistance and information from the Public Authorities concerned but he has sought more and new information, as it is necessary to establish the cause of the problems and the need for change. He has persuaded the Tribunal that the specific facts sought in the subject request are new and have not been specifically sought or provided before. He has persuaded us that the information sought is important and should be made available without causing distress or inconvenience to the Public Authority concerned. He has persuaded us that while it is clear the Public Authority concerned and others have had to deal with many requests, and have dealt with some, there remains a high and significant Public Interest in supplying the information sought for the population of the wider area in question and in this instance in particular the area of Whitburn. He demonstrates the effect of sewage spillage on the residents of Whitburn and how children and other residents and visiting families there have to suffer the chronic effects of inadequate water treatment facilities. He states that there is no sea life in the rock pools now, no warning signs re poor water quality at Whitburn and surfers have reported ear infections. He argues that if he had the requested information 10he could show it at the planning meetings and explain why another treatment works was needed. [16] The Tribunal are not persuaded that the Appellant is misusing EIR and are not persuaded that: “ - - - the Public Authority have not been able to go about their business without having staff time and resources deployed on repetitive and unreasonably persistent requests for information.” The Tribunal find the request generally, and in particular for “consent that allows the CSOs to spill at 4.5XDWF”, reasonable and not particularly demanding. We have read the correspondence in the OB carefully and find that the tone is not particularly objectionable and not likely to cause offence. The correspondence generally demonstrates proper purpose and real concern even if on occasion, with a degree of frustration. In all the circumstances we do not accept that the subject request is manifestly unreasonable. Further on the specific facts of this appeal, we find the balance weighs in favour of the Public Interest not maintaining the exemption and favours disclosure. [17] Accordingly we unanimously allow the appeal and agree with the Respondents suggestion at Para 79 of their Response to the Grounds of Appeal at page 80 of the OB, that the Public Authority (the EA), issue a fresh response to the Appellant not relying on r12 (4)(B) EIR.

"161","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0277 Between THOMAS BURKE Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Second Respondent TRIBUNAL: Judge Moira Macmillan Mrs Suzanne Cosgrave Mr Michael Jones Decided on the papers pursuant to rule 32(1)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (First- tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 On 11 September 2019 and 3 October 2019 Subject matter: s. 31 Freedom of Information Act 2000 ICO Decision Notice FS50774119 DECISION 1For the reasons set out below the appeal is allowed in part. SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: The Department for International Development Complainant: Mr Thomas Burke Decision For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal decides that the Public Authority failed to deal with the Complainant’s request for Information made on 22 December 2017 in accordance with FOIA in that they ought to have made additional parts of “05-17 IAD Investigation Report – Development Aid from People to People (DAPP)” as referred to below available to the Complainant. Steps to be taken The Public Authority must by 17.00 on 16 January 2020 supply to the Complainant the following: 1) A re-formatted copy of the report reflecting the original page numbering and headings, redacted only to the extent indicated in the Closed Schedule hereto; and 2) Those parts of the report indicated as being disclosable in the Closed Schedule. REASONS FOR DECISION Factual background 1. This appeal concerns an information request made by Mr Burke to the Department for International Development (‘DFID’) on 22 December 2017 about its funding arrangements with a charity in Malawi called Development Aid from People to People (‘DAPP Malawi’). 2. On 2 August 2016 the BBC broadcast a radio programme in which it alleged that DAPP Malawi was under the control of an international organisation called the Teachers Group, and that the leadership of the Teachers Group was implicated in criminal misconduct. The programme followed a joint 2investigation between the BBC and the US Centre for Investigative Reporting (‘CIR’). One of the allegations was that staff working for DAPP Malawi were forced to pay a portion of their salary to the Teachers Group. 3. At the time of the broadcast DFID was funding DAPP Malawi as a primary partner in 2 projects. The funding was by way of an Accountable Grant, which is an arrangement based on a mutual agreement between parties about services to be delivered and a payment schedule associated with outcomes. 4. Following the BBC broadcast DFID suspended payments to DAPP Malawi under the Accountable Grant. Officers from DFID’s Counter Fraud Service (‘CFS’) carried out an investigation in Malawi between 5 – 11 August 2016. 5. On 16 August 2016 a submission about the investigation was made to a department minister to which a draft report was attached. A redacted copy of this submission was disclosed to Mr Burke on 26 July 2018 following an information request he made on 17 May 2018. 6. This appeal relates to the final version of the report that was attached to the submission. It was finalised on 14 September 2016 and on 5 October 2016 DFID decided to terminate all DAPP Malawi programmes in place at the time. 7. Mr Burke is associated with the CIR. Following CIR’s reporting of the outcome of the joint investigation, two representatives of DAPP Malawi have brought a defamation claim in the US against CIR and two of its investigative journalists, seeking punitive damages. The Request and DFID’s response 8. On 22 December 2017 Mr Burke requested from DFID: i. The DFID internal assessment in early August 2016 of allegations concerning DAPP [referred to in a letter sent to Mr Burke on 28 November 2017]; ii. [confirmation of] whether DFID funding to DAPP Malawi remains suspended or has been terminated, and if it was terminated, the date upon which the decision to terminate was taken; and iii. [If funding to DAPP Malawi remains suspended or has been terminated], any final report which underpins the decision to continue to suspend or terminate such funding. 9. On 25 January 2018 DFID responded to Mr Burke, confirming that it held information falling within the scope of his request which it considered to be exempt from disclosure under sections 31, 36 and 43 of FOIA. DFID 3explained that it needed more time to consider the balance of public interest test. 10. On 29 March 2018 DFID provided a substantive response. In response to request part (i) DFID explained that it held an Internal Audit Investigation Report (‘the Report’) but considered this exempt from disclosure on the basis of sections 31(1)(a) & (b), 40(2), 41(1) and 43(2) of FOIA. In relation to request part (ii) DFID told Mr Burke that funding for DAPP Malawi had been suspended during DFID’s internal investigation and terminated on 5 October 2016. In relation to request part (iii) DFID explained that DAPP Malawi was not barred from bidding for other work with the department. 11. On 24 May 2018 Mr Burke requested an internal review of this decision. When the result of the review was not forthcoming on 30 July 2018 Mr Burke complained to the Information Commissioner. The Commissioner’s Investigation and Decision Notice 12. The Information Commissioner investigated the complaint. She issued Decision Notice FS50774119 (‘the DN’) on 13 November 2018. At this stage DFID had still not completed its internal review but it had indicated its intended response in correspondence with the ICO (see OB/132 – 144). 13. During the investigation Mr Burke argued that s. 31 should not apply to the information in the report because it was too late to prevent any crimes that may have been committed. He also raised the public interest of protecting the freedom of speech of journalists as considered by CJEU in Magyar Helsinki Bizottag v Hungary (18030/11) which he argued was relevant given the US litigation against CIR. 14. The Commissioner concluded that the majority of the Report came within the s. 31(1) exemption. In doing so the Commissioner accepted DFID’s argument that disclosure of a confidential report would be likely to prejudice future law enforcement because it would have ‘a chilling effect’ on those who provide information to such investigations on an understanding of confidentiality. The Commissioner was not persuaded by DFID’s secondary argument under s. 31 (1) that disclosure would prejudice future investigation because it would reveal details of DFID’s investigatory techniques. 15. Because s. 31 is a qualified exemption, the Commissioner went on to consider the public interest test set out in s. 2 (2) (b). She concluded that, although there is a significant public interest in transparency in relation to DFID’s use of public funds for overseas development, and in its response to allegations of the misuse of such funds, there was also a ‘very important’ public interest in ensuring that DFID was able to carry out robust investigations in order to safeguard the use of such funds. 416. The Commissioner dismissed Mr Burke’s argument in relation to the Magyar case on the basis that the UK’s domestic law does not yet recognise a general right of access to information under Article 10 of ECHR. She concluded that the public interest ‘narrowly favours’ maintaining the exemptions contained in s. 31(1)(a) & (b). 17. The Commissioner decided that DFID should disclose to Mr Burke any part of the Report which does not contain information provided by a 3rd party or comments on 3rd party information. 18. The Commissioner rejected DFID’s argument that s. 43 (2) FOIA was equally engaged by the material. She did not consider DFID’s arguments in relation to ss. 40 (2) and 41 (1) because she concluded that s.31 (1) applied to those parts of the Report DFID had indicated would be subject to these exemptions. 19. Once the DN had been issued DFID sent further correspondence to the Commissioner and obtained her agreement to some further redactions. (OB/149-153). 20. DFID then disclosed a redacted version of the Report to Mr Burke which is 4 pages long. The unredacted report is 18 pages long. The Legal Framework 21. Section 31 of FOIA provides as follows: Law enforcement. (1) Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (a) the prevention or detection of crime, (b) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, (c) … 22. The application of this exemption requires consideration of a prejudice- based test. The prejudice must be real, actual or of substance, and in this context “likely” means a very significant and weighty chance of prejudice to an identified public interest.1 23. The public interest balancing test is described in s.2 (2) as circumstances where ‘the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information’. 1 R (Lord) v Secretary of State for the home Department [2003] EWHC 20173 (Admin) para 106 524. S. 40 (2) provides an exemption for the disclosure of personal information if specified conditions are satisfied. One of these conditions is contravention of a data protection principle, including the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency set out in Article 5 (1) (a) of GDPR. However, disclosure of personal information may still be lawful where it is necessary for the legitimate interests of a third party.2 Grounds of Appeal 25. In Grounds of Appeal dated 11 December 2018 Mr Burke seeks disclosure of the redacted portions of the Report. He accepts that s. 31 is engaged but submits that the Commissioner has wrongly weighed the balance of competing public interests. He suggests that the identities of those who provided information could be protected while still allowing disclosure of additional information. 26. Mr Burke argues that transparency concerning aid funding is an overwhelming reason for disclosure. He says that the Commissioner has placed too great a weight on the argument that disclosure would inhibit future willingness to provide information to DFID investigations. This is because the department ‘holds the purse strings.’ and because those who provided information must have anticipated publication. He argues that those who provided information are aid workers who will take the same view as him of the strong public interest in publishing information about financial wrongdoing, and that they would have anticipated publication. 27. Mr Burke states that he is not appealing the Commissioner’s conclusions on the applicability of Magyar but argues that she failed to consider the public interest of protecting the freedom of speech of journalists. 28. Mr Burke challenges the Commissioner’s description of the redacted information as being a ‘very detailed analysis’ because the redacted Report is 4 pages long and is numbered in a way that suggests the original is the same length. Submissions 29. The Commissioner notes that Mr Burkes does not challenge her conclusion that s. 31(1) is engaged. She explains that the unredacted Report is considerably longer than 4 pages and reiterates her observation that it is a detailed analysis of the issues. She submits that the public interest in that transparency has been satisfied by revealing that an investigation has taken place and by partial publication of the Report. 2 GDPR Art 6 (1)(f) 630. The Commissioner submits that it is unrealistic to argue that DFID could compel individuals to cooperate with future investigations. She observes that there are different degrees of cooperation in such a context. The Commissioner observes that significant changes have been made in the past to government policy due to investigation reports of this nature. She argues that there is a strong public interest in avoiding prejudice to future reports. 31. The Commissioner submits that the outcome of the defamation litigation in the US is a private interest rather than a general public interest. 32. The Secretary of State adopts the Commissioner’s submissions as they relate to s. 31 (1). He observes that DFID has no statutory powers to compel cooperation with any investigation. CFS investigations are conducted in accordance with the confidentiality principle set out in the Guidelines of the Conference of International Investigators. CFS investigation reports are not shared externally other than with fraud investigation agencies and then under a sharing agreement. 33. The Secretary of State submits that the public interest in transparency has already been served in part by the earlier publication of the redacted submission of 16 August 2016. 34. He states that the individuals who gave information to the CFS investigation include DAPP Malawi employees and beneficiaries of DAPP Malawi projects. The Secretary of State argues that it is naive to assume that individuals who live in a State where the rule of law is weak will want information of this nature to be made public. There is a real risk of reprisals and the Report cannot be disclosed with fewer redactions while still protecting the identity of 3rd parties. This is because of the risk they will be identified from the specific information they provided. 35. In relation to the US litigation the Secretary of State argues that the issue of freedom of speech, if engaged, will be managed by a sophisticated legal system with the power to obtain documents in the possession of 3rd parties in the UK. 36. The Secretary of State contends that, should the Tribunal find that s. 31 is not engaged by the Report, s. 40 (2), 41 and 43 should be considered. 37. In reply Mr Burke states that the basis for invoking s. 31 in the context of a DFID investigation is marginal and unsubstantiated. However, he acknowledges that this was not raised in his Grounds of Appeal. He asks the Tribunal to consider ordering DFID to provide a summary of the withheld material. Relevant findings of fact 738. Notwithstanding the comments in Mr Burke’s reply, it is accepted between the parties that s. 31 is engaged by the Report. 39. We agree that the s. 31 (1) (a) exemption is engaged by the DFID investigative process. It seeks to prevent prejudice to the prevention or detection of crime. We find that the investigation of crime is not limited to an investigation carried out with the objective of bringing a criminal prosecution. Two objectives of the CFS Malawi investigation were to detect whether a crime had been committed and to prevent the repetition of unlawful behaviour. These objectives will be equally present in future investigations. 40. We also find that the s. 31 (1) (b) exemption applies to the Report since, at the date it was written, the investigation of potential wrongdoing was not complete and there is nothing to suggest that this had changed at the date of request. 41. We note that DFID did not challenge the Information Commissioner’s finding that some of the Report could be published. We conclude that DFID must have been satisfied that the information already disclosed in the redacted Report was not information received in confidence during the course of CFS’s investigation and did not require the protection of the s. 31 (1) exemption. Public interest in disclosure 42. We have considered several public interest factors in favour of further disclosure. There is clearly a general public interest in openness and transparency about DFID’s conduct in terms of how it uses public money, how it responds to allegations of misuse and the effectiveness and robustness of its investigations. 43. We agree with the Commissioner’s conclusion that there is significant public interest in this transparency, which is increased by DFID’s public stance of having a zero-tolerance approach to misuse of funds, giving rise to a public interest in transparency about the actions taken in support of this approach. 44. In the present case the public interest in transparency is further increased by the BBC’s reporting of alleged wrongdoing, giving rise to an important public interest in transparency about how DFID’s zero tolerance policy has been applied. 45. There is also a strong public interest in the publication of the outcome of the investigation, although we note that the publication of the report’s conclusion may not reveal a substantive position. 846. We have also considered several public interest factors against further disclosure. The Secretary of State has identified a number of documents relating to this investigation that have already been published, giving rise to increased transparency. 47. There is also a clear public interest in not undermining investigations into fraud and misconduct. We agree with the Commissioner’s assessment of the importance of confidentiality, and in particular being able to rely an assurance of confidentiality when speaking to individuals who have no contractual or other obligations to cooperate with the investigation 48. We consider an assurance of confidentiality to be key when encouraging people to come forward and instilling confidence in 3rd parties that they can give a frank account to investigators without fear of reprisals. 49. We note the Commissioner’s conclusion in paragraph 39 of the DN that the public interest balance test narrowly favours maintaining the s. 31 exemption from disclosure. 50. In light of this finely balanced decision, had the information released by DFID about this investigation in any way misrepresented its position we consider there might have been greater weight in favour of transparency. Having reviewed the withheld information, however, we have found no basis to conclude that DFID has been anything other than transparent in terms of the information it has released in respect of this investigation. The evidence suggests that DFID has not sought to avoid its responsibility and has followed FOIA processes. 51. We have considered the public interest in freedom of speech both generally and in the context of the US litigation. Mr Burke has asked the Tribunal to give weight to a wider public interest in defence of freedom of speech in the context of the US litigation. We have concluded that the conduct of this litigation, as described by Mr Burke, is a private interest rather than a general public interest. Conclusions 52. We find that the s. 31 (1) (a) and (b) exemptions apply to information given to this investigation in an expectation of confidentiality and to the analysis of any such information. 953. We have considered Mr Burke’s request for a summary of the withheld information. We find that DFID has already published summaries of the content of the investigation in both the redacted report and the redacted 16 August 2016 submission to ministers. 54. We have concluded that it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to second guess the Information Commissioner and DFID’s assessments of the information within the Report that cannot be disclosed without revealing either information given to the investigation in confidence or an analysis of such information, other than in relation to the Report’s Contents page. 55. We find that the headings currently redacted from the Contents page are so general in nature that they do not meet the description of being information given to the investigation in confidence. That definition will apply to the content of each section the headings represent but not to the headings themselves. These should be disclosed. The Closed Schedule 56. In the Closed Schedule we have set out our conclusions on the applicability of s. 31 in relation to the withheld parts of the Report and of s. 40(2) in relation to one public official. We have taken into account all the circumstances of the case in assessing the public interest balance, including the general public interest consideration we have set out below. We have also had regard to all submissions made. 57. The Closed Schedule indicates the parts of the Report we consider should be disclosed and those which were properly withheld, and we have issued a substituted Decision Notice. 58. In the normal way a copy of this Decision was sent to the Commissioner and to DFID for them to check the draft and make representations as to whether any parts of the Decision should not be disclosed. The version of the Decision provided to Mr Burke and promulgated generally will have been redacted and/or edited if necessary in light of such representations.

"193","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0207 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Ms Melanie Howard and Mr Michael Jones Between Ashley Rumbold Appellant -and- The Information Commissioner Essex County Council Respondents Sitting at Field House on 5 December 2019 Representation: The Appellant represented himself by telephone The Commissioner and Essex County Council were not represented 1DECISION AND REASONS THE REQUEST AND THE DECISION NOTICE 1. On 3 September 2018, the Appellant spoke to an officer at Essex County Council (the Council) on the telephone and the following request for information was recorded:- ""QUESTION 1 - 2577061 (CONFIRM REF) THE RESIDENTS OF [address redacted] HAVE EFFECTIVELY ADOPTED THE HIGHWAY AND PUT UP ""NO PARKING"" SIGNS. CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS REGARDING THIS ENQUIRY AND I WOULD LIKE COPIES OF THE LETTERS SENT TO THE RESIDENT OF THE GRANGE WITHOUT THEIR PERSONAL DETAILS, I JUST WANT TO SEE THE CONTENT AND THE COUNCILS STATEMENT REGARDING THE MATTER."" 2. The reference number 2577061 corresponds to an entry on the Council’s site history report for a village in Essex which is included in the bundle for this appeal. The entry states that an enquiry was logged at 12.25 on 26 June 2018. The subject was said to be ‘obstruction of highway land’, and the location is ‘In front of The Grange on Church Road’. It is recorded that ‘Caller States - Driveway work being done here is incorporating and changing highways owned layby in from of properties. Resident has previously attempted to build on this land but ECC stopped them as it is our land’. 3. We can also see in our bundle another mention of the reference number 2577061 and the enquiry set out above in a screen shot from 2the Council, where there is an entry which states ‘no further action needed’, and there are further notes which state:- Call from resident who is concerned that the owner of the Grange has encroached on the highway and put up no parking signs. Discussed with senior CS who advised this would be low… 4. Our understanding is that there would be more text which is not visible as this is a screenshot, and we assume the next word would be ‘priority’ (given the conclusion that there would be no further action). We think that CS stands for ‘Council Surveyor’. There is a date which is 30 August 2018, a few days before the request was made. 5. This encapsulates the nature of the issue about which the Appellant is concerned: a local landowner is said to be appropriating a layby and a footpath in the village and incorporating it into their property. 6. The Council responded on 30 September 2018. It provided some information within the scope of the request. This included the Highway Enforcement Policy, a standard template of the letter that would have been sent to the residents complained about. It was also explained that there was no formal process to remove the highway rights in place, and that the area remained part of the publicly maintainable highway. 7. It appears the Council interpreted the request for the ‘decision making process’ as a reference to its enforcement policy, rather than what it had actually done with the enquiry. 8. The Appellant asked for a review of the decision in relation to disclosure. This was done by telephone on 16 October 2018. The Council recorded the request for the review in its response of 1 3November 2018 (see below). It is said that the Appellant was of the view that there was more information on the system regarding Church Road including complaints from the public, case file and an inspector’s report. 9. Prior to a response on the review, the Council’s Customer Services Advisor sent an email to the Appellant on 26 October 2018. This said that there were further enquiries to complete, but ‘we have been advised that the Enforcement Team will be taking this on as an enforcement case and once they have collated the information and evidence they require they will begin liaising with the landowner’. 10. As stated above, the Council wrote to the Appellant on 1 November 2018, stating that within the Appellant's request for an internal review, further information was asked for, and the Council would need to treat that as a separate request. We assume this is a reference to other complaints from the public, case file and the inspector’s report as mentioned in the letter. The Council also stated that it did not hold any further information that fell within the scope of the Appellant’s initial request. · 11. Following this, the Appellant then made a further request to which the Council responded on 11 December 2018, providing further information, which included the specific entries in relation to enquiry 2577061, which we have described above. 12. The Appellant contacted the Commissioner on 9 November 2018 to complain about the way his request for information had been handled. There is a decision notice dated 18 June 2019. As the Commissioner records, the Appellant is of the opinion that the information asked for in the second request, should be covered by the scope of what was asked for in the initial request. 413. The Commissioner also notes that one of the points made by the Appellant is that the Council did not record all of his original request which he made on the telephone. The Commissioner comments that it is not now possible to determine whether that is right as no recording of the call exists (the Council confirmed that any recordings of telephone conversations were only kept for 30 days). 14. The Commissioner states that she asked the Council to describe the searches it had completed in an effort to find any information within the scope of the request. The Council responded to explain the following: The initial request for information only related to 'details of the decision-making process regarding his enquiry and copies of letters sent to resident of [address redacted] without personal details'. The council provided a standard template letter that was sent to all residents, this was the same letter that was sent to all residents. We also provided a link our Highway Authority Enforcement Policy which describes our decision-making process. 15. The Commissioner did not appear entirely satisfied with this response and stated that she:- 22…..recognises that ""details of the decision making process"" could be viewed as more than one particular document in general. As it relates to a specific complaint, it would be reasonable to see this request to be for more details about the decision-making process relating to the specific enforcement action for the reference number quoted. 16. The Commissioner notes that the Council accepted this point, but that in response to what looked like a request for further information when the Appellant asked for a review, and in relation to a further request thereafter, the Council had provided the 5Appellant with further information on 11 December 2018. 17. The Commissioner asked to see the information that had been sent to the Appellant as a result of the second request. The Council provided this and advised that it has provided everything it holds that falls within the scope of the requests, apart from the personal information which it had redacted. The Commissioner states that the information includes:- 26 …..some historical photographs of the site, some current photographs of the site, redacted records on its case management system showing concerns about the site made by complainants, a map that shows the area of encroachment, the template of the letter sent to the resident and the policy used to make decisions on the Council's enforcement activity. 27 From viewing the screenshots of the records on the Council's case management system, the Commissioner sees that there is a record of some enforcement activity, in the status field and the field where notes can be added. The Commissioner sees that this is the case for each screenshot of the concerns made to the Council relating to the highway encroachment. 18. The Commissioner then asked the Council ‘whether it held any further recorded information, which it used to make a decision on the specific enquiry the Appellant quoted’. We take this to be a reference to enquiry 2577061, and shows that the Commissioner was concentrating on deciding whether the information limited to the decision-making process for that enquiry had been disclosed. The Council’s response was that it had:- ""…investigated further with the service area that provided the initial response regarding the 'decision making process'. No further information is used other than 'The Highway Authority Enforcement Policy' that was provided in the complainant's first request, this 6explains how the authority will consider matters for enforcement."" 19. On that basis the Commissioner concluded at paragraph 29 that she ‘finds that the Council does not hold the information requested by the complainant, or at least from the evidence provided, what was recorded to have been requested by the complainant’. In context, we take the Commissioner to mean that no further information is held within the scope of the Appellant’s request. THE APPEAL 20. The Appellant’s appeal is dated 18 June 2019. He states that there are other complaints on the issue from other residents which have not been disclosed to him, and that he has not been provided with any information about the activities of the Enforcement Team who have had ‘ownership of the complaint for enforcement purposes for approximately one year’. 21. He says that the policy document provided by the Council states that the Council will conduct its enforcement functions with transparency and accountability. He also complains that the Council will not provide him with the name of the relevant legal officer who has replaced the person named in the policy document. 22. The Commissioner’s Response upholds the decision notice. We have cited part of the Response below in our discussion. The Council has been joined as a party to the Appeal. The Council’s grounds of opposition state that ‘We maintain that we have provided [the] appellant with the information which he requested’ in the response to the initial request. 23. Neither the Council nor the Commissioner attended at the hearing. 7The Appellant attended on the telephone. He explained to us his frustration that, in his view, the Council had not dealt with the issue he had raised, even though the Council had stated that it would take on the case as an enforcement issue as long ago as 25 October 2018. He repeated the point made in his appeal that there must be more information from the enforcement team that had not been disclosed. 24. The Tribunal had sympathy for the Appellant and the enforcement issue he has been pursuing. We explained to him that the Tribunal had to consider what information was held by the Council at the time he made his request on 3 September 2018, and we were not considering whether the Council had generated further information by the time of the Commissioner’s decision notice in June 2019 or by the time of the appeal hearing in December 2019. DISCUSSION 25. Regulation 5(1) EIR states that ‘a public authority that holds environmental information shall make it available on request’. This is the provision that we have to apply in this case, and to decide whether it has been complied with. Regulation 5(1) EIR is subject to any exceptions that may apply. 26. The Commissioner and now the Tribunal must decide whether, on the balance of probabilities, the Council held any further information which fell within the scope of the request, at the time the request was made, which it did not disclose. 27. We note that there is a dispute as to what was requested as the Appellant says that the Council did not record the entirety of the request. In our view, the Commissioner and now the Tribunal 8should deal with the case on the basis of the only record of the request that is now in existence (see above). 28. We also note that the Appellant specifically did not ask for personal details of the residents he complained about, and so the provision of personal information is not an issue in this appeal. 29. It is not entirely clear from the decision notice how the Commissioner has approached this case. On the one hand at paragraph 22 of the decision notice, the Commissioner appears to criticise the Council for taking a too narrow view of the request when she says that it ‘would be reasonable to see this request to be for more details about the decision making process relating to the specific enforcement action for the reference number quoted’, rather than simply disclosing a general enforcement policy document. 30. However, when the Council re-iterated that ‘No further information is used other than [the enforcement policy] that was provided in the complainant's first request’, the Commissioner appears to accept, at paragraph 29 of the decision notice, that disclosure of the enforcement document fulfils the requirement to provide information about the decision making process in relation to the first request. 31. The Commissioner’s Response to the appeal attempts to explain this by stating that :- It is clear that at the time of the request the Council’s response to provide details of the Enforcement Policy was correct given that, at the time, the matter had only been referred to the Enforcement Manager for consideration, and therefore it appears that no decision had been made. 932. However, in our view this is not a complete answer to the Appellant’s appeal. As set out above, at the time of the request the records held by the Council show that the enquiry had been recorded on the site history database. The records also show, as of 30 August 2018 (four days before the request), the case had been referred to a ‘senior CS’ who decided that the case was low priority, and that therefore no action was needed. 33. In our view these entries constituted ‘details of the decision- making process’ in relation to this enquiry which were requested by the Appellant on 3 September 2018. It seems obvious to us that the Appellant was asking for information as to what had happened to his enquiry, and was not simply seeking the Council’s general enforcement policy that would be applied to his enquiry. 34. Thus, in our view the Commissioner was wrong to conclude that, on 3 September 2019, the Council held no further information within the scope of the request. We have now seen the information which was not disclosed (and the dates when it was created) and so we can be sure that it was held at the time of the request. 35. On that basis the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. However, it also seems to us that the additional information held by the Council has now been disclosed as a result of the response to the second request. It seems to us unlikely that the Council held anything else relevant to the enquiry at the time of the request on 3 September 2018, given that the records show that, as of 30 August 2018, no further action was needed. 1036. On that basis no further directions are necessary. We understand that that might be a pyrrhic victory for the Appellant and he may need to make further requests for more recent information that has been generated by the Council in relation to this matter, if that is what he seeks.

"291","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0086 Decided without a hearing On 16 August 2019 Before JUDGE HAZEL OLIVER MRS JEAN NELSON MR MIKE JONES Between MR MARTIN L ADEDEJI Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION The appeal is upheld in part SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE On the balance of probabilities, the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust (the “Trust”) holds additional information in relation to alleged racist incidents reported to it in 2010, because one incident for this year was listed in an email from the Trust to Mr Adedeji dated 17 May 2016. The Trust should provide this additional information to Mr Adedeji, or explain how this information has already been provided, or explain why this information is not held. The Trust should do so with reference to its email of 17 May 2016 and its initial response to the current request.REASONS Background to Appeal 1. This appeal is against a decision of the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) dated 18 February 2019 (FS50667337, the “Decision Notice). It concerns information sought from Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust (the “Trust”) regarding racist incidents reported to the Trust. 2. The parties opted for paper determination of the appeal (the appellant confirming this is an email to the Tribunal dated 6 June). The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended). 3. On 23 July 2019 the appellant made the following request for information (the “Request”): “Dear Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, This is a Freedom of Information Request. Please inform me whether or not you hold the information specified below. If you do hold the requested information please be so kind as to send me a copy. Regarding all Racist Incidents reported to you please send me a copy of recorded information you hold showing:- 1. Date the racist incident is alleged to have occurred 2. Alleged perpetrator’s professional status and job title 3. Whether alleged victim was a patient or a member of your staff 4. What support the alleged racist incident victim received 5. Who investigated the alleged racist incident 6. The outcome of your investigation into the alleged racist incident 7. What other organisations you informed of the racist incident” 4. The Trust responded on 18 August 2016. In relation to patients, it provided information in a table relating to parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Request (headed “from patients”). It stated that information was not held by the Trust relating to parts 4 and 7 of the Request. In relation to staff, it provided details of four cases (one grievance and three Employment Tribunal claims), including parts 4 and 7 of the Request where applicable (headed “from staff”). 5. The appellant asked for an internal review. The Trust responded on 18 November 2016 with a further explanation of the information already provided, and sent some additional information. The appellant complained to the Commissioner on 10 February 2017 about the way in which his request had been handled by the Trust. 6. The Commissioner issued her Decision Notice on 18 February 2019. She found that, on the balance of probabilities, the Trust did not hold any information within the scope of parts 4and 7 of the Request, and so it had complied with section 1(1) FOIA. The Commissioner considered the searches performed by the Trust and found that they were adequate to identify the information that was held at the time of the Request. The Appeal 7. The appellant appealed against the Commissioner’s decision on 18 March 2019. The grounds are that he has evidence to show that the Trust has failed to provide all of the information which it holds within the scope of the Request. He provides the following examples: a. Information about grievances, employment tribunal claims and patient complaints provided in response to FOIA requests made in March and May 2016 – a 2010 incident has been omitted in the current response. b. Missing information about a complaint the appellant made about an incident in 2007. 8. The Commissioner’s response maintains that, on the balance of probabilities, no further information was held by the Trust. The Commissioner obtained details during her investigation about how complaints are recorded on the Trust’s Datix system. In relation to the 2007 incident, this was not discovered as a result of the Trust’s searches, and given the passage of time it is more likely than not that details were no longer held by the Trust. In relation to the 2010 incident, other details about staff complaints were disclosed, and there was no evidence of an attempt to mislead or withhold information. 9. The appellant’s response makes the following points: a. There is a Trust document titled “Workforce Race Equality Standard REPORTING TEMPLATE (Revised 2016)” which appears to contain a record of racist incidents among staff for the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016. The Trust is likely to hold similar documents for other years. b. There is no reference in the Trust’s responses to the 2010 incident, which the Trust had told the appellant about in their response to his previous FOIA request (on 17 May 2016). c. In relation to the 2007 incident, the appellant reported this to the GMC in 2012. An email from the GMC in March 2012 stated that a copy of the complaint had been passed to the employers of the doctor. A letter from the Trust to the appellant on 31 October 2013 also stated, “Your complaint has been recorded by the Trust’s Patient Relations Department”. d. The Commissioner’s investigation was poor and failed to obtain the correct submissions from the Trust. Applicable law 10. The relevant provisions of FOIA are as follows. 1 General right of access to information held by public authorities. (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. .….58 Determination of appeals (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 11. In determining whether or not information is held, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. It is rarely possible to be certain that information relevant to a FOIA request is not held somewhere in a large public authority’s records. The Tribunal should look at all of the circumstances of the case, including evidence about the public authority’s record-keeping systems and the searches that have been conducted for the information, in order to determine whether on the balance of probabilities further information is held by the public authority. Evidence and submissions 12. We had an agreed bundle of open documents, all of which we have read. The appellant submitted a written skeleton argument. This repeats his previous points, and also refers to a reference in the Trust’s Equality Delivery System Assessment 2015 scores that 9% of staff indicate they have experienced discrimination in the last 12 months. Discussion and Conclusions 13. In accordance with section 58 of FOIA, our role is to consider whether the Commissioner’s Decision Notice was in accordance with the law. As set out in section 58(2), we may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. This means that we can review all of the evidence provided to us and make our own decision. Our role does not involve addressing detailed criticisms of the Commissioner’s investigation. We may or may not agree with the Commissioner’s conclusions. 14. The Trust provided an explanation on how it searched for the requested information in its letter to the Commissioner of 25 September 2017. a. The Trust has a Datix system which records events relating to patients. It provided a table of incidents in response to the Request, based on searches of the Datix system. Prior to 2010 there was no specific code on this system for “racist incidents”. From April 2010 “racial” was recognised as an adverse event, and from April 2014 sub-categories of racial abuse were recorded under the category of “violence, aggression or abuse”. Searches were carried out using category and sub-category searching criteria, and using a free text incident description search for information prior to April 2010. In relation to requests (4) and (7), the Trust says that thisinformation is not captured by the system, and it would require intellectual analysis and creation of new information to answer these requests. b. In relation to incidents relating to staff, the Trust provided a list of four cases together with the requested information about each case where available. Three of these cases are Employment Tribunal claims in 2011, 2013 and 2014. The other case is a two-part issue involving a grievance in 2011 and a subsequent Employment Tribunal claim. This information has been provided from a review of information held within the HR casefiles. 15. The appellant says that the Trust has not disclosed information about a complaint he submitted to the Trust himself, which relates to an incident in 2007. a. We note that information on Datix was not categorised by race/racist incident prior to April 2010, so any information held by the Trust about an incident in 2007 which was reported at that time would not have been identified by a category search and may not have been picked up by their free text search. b. We have seen a copy of a letter from the General Medical Council dated 2 March 2012, which relates to this complaint. This letter states, “Also a copy of the complaint has been passed to the employers of the doctor who can then conduct their own investigations”. This indicates that the Trust does hold information about this complaint. c. We have also seen a letter from the Trust dated 31 October 2013, which provides information in response to a set of concerns from the appellant about the same incident. This letter provides a response to all of the items that are listed in the current Request, apart from request 7 (what other organisations you informed of the racist incident). The Trust has stated that it does not capture information in relation to the request 7 issue. 16. We therefore find that the appellant has already been provided with the response to his Request in relation to his own complaint, as set out in the letter of 31 October 2013 from the Trust. This does not answer request number 7, but we accept that the Trust does not record this information. It would have been helpful if the Trust had explained to the appellant that they were not providing information in relation to his own complaint in response to the current Request, because they had already provided this information in their earlier letter. However, we are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant has already had this information from the Trust and no further information is held on this point. 17. The appellant says that the Trust has failed to disclose information about a 2010 complaint, which was listed in response to a previous FOIA request. a. We have seen a FOIA request from the appellant dated 3 March 2016, in which he asks for information held on racist incidents perpetrated or alleged to have been perpetrated by the Trust’s healthcare professionals. The response from the Trust dated 6 April 2016 states there was one grievance by a staff member relating to other staff, three Employment Tribunal claims, and three complaints by patients against staff which alleged racist behaviour.b. The appellant then asked for the number of racist incidents for each specific year. An email from the Trust to the appellant dated 17 May 2016 provides a list of incidents by year. This shows one incident for each of 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2014, and two incidents in 2011. A later email from the Trust dated 6 June 2016 clarifies that a total of six rather than seven incidents are listed because two entries provided previously related to the same event. c. The response to the current Request in relation to staff lists four cases, as explained above. None of these cases relate to 2009 or 2010. In his appeal, the appellant lists incident number 63361 from the “from patients” table provided by the Trust. This is an incident from 2009 involving a staff nurse. It therefore appears that the 2009 incident is included in the “from patients” table. However, this table does not include any incidents involving staff from 2010. 18. There is a mismatch between the information provided by the Trust in 2016 as compared to the information provided in response to this Request. The Trust previously stated there was one incident recorded in 2010. No information about staff incidents in 2010 has been disclosed in response to the Request in the “from staff” document, or in the “from patients” document. On the evidence we have it appears that not all held information has been provided. We therefore find on the balance of probabilities that the Trust does hold additional information about staff complaints in 2010. The Trust should provide this additional information to the appellant, or explain how this information has already been provided, or explain why this information is not held. The Trust should do so with reference to its email of 17 May 2016 and its initial response to the Request. 19. The appellant has referred to the Trust’s document “Workforce Race Equality Standard REPORTING TEMPLATE (Revised 2016)”, and the Equality Delivery System Assessment 2015. He says that both of these documents refer to racist incidents reported by staff. However, having viewed these documents, it is clear that they are reporting the response to questions asked to staff about whether they had experienced discrimination at work. It is common for staff to report experiences in a survey which have not been raised with their employer. The fact that staff have reported experiencing discrimination at work does not mean that they have provided any further details to the Trust. We therefore find on the balance of probabilities that the Trust does not hold any further information about the issues reported in these documents which could be provided in response to the Request. 20. The appellant has also complained about the Commissioner’s investigation. This is not a matter that we can deal with in this appeal. As explained above, we have made our own decision on the evidence. 21. We uphold the appeal in part in relation to the incident in 2010 listed by the Trust on 17 May 2016, as explained above.

"351","Procedural Refusal","Appeal number:<U+F020> EA/2018/0267 FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ANTHONY GALLAGHER Appellant - and - THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent TRIBUNAL: JUDGE ALEXANDRA MARKS CBE ANNE CHAFER DAVID WILKINSON SITTING IN CHAMBERS IN LONDON EC2 on 31 MAY 2019 Neither party appeared as, by consent, this case was considered on the papers © CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal allows in part the appeal against Decision Notice FS50788702, and issues the following substitute Decision Notice. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Organisation: Hampshire County Council Complainant: Anthony Gallagher The Substitute Decision – FS50788702 I. For the reasons set out below, Hampshire County Council (‘HCC’), breached section 10 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’) because the information requested by Anthony Gallagher at part 4 of his request dated 9 July 2018 was, on the balance of probabilities, held by HCC yet HCC did not provide such information within the timescale required by FOIA. II. HCC did not breach section 16 FOIA because – in view of the above finding that HCC did hold the information Mr Gallagher requested – it was not reasonable to expect (and indeed there was no need for) HCC to provide Mr Gallagher with advice and assistance to make a request for that information. III. However, once HCC had (erroneously) concluded that it did not hold the information requested, if HCC had gone on to consider its section 16 FOIA duty to provide advice and assistance as well as the Commissioner's guidance on holding information, on the balance of probabilities HCC would have realised that it did after all hold the information requested. IV. As Mr Gallagher has since received information from HCC (in response to his subsequent request for information dated 6 August 2018) - such information being in the form of the ‘building blocks’ which would enable him to calculate for himself the information he originally requested - no purpose would be served by requiring HCC to take any further steps. REASONS Background to Appeal Request, Internal Review, Decision Notice and Appeal 2. On 9 July 2018, Mr Gallagher made a request for information to HCC. The request comprised four questions. 23. On 6 August 2018, HCC provided information in response to the first three questions. 4. HCC stated that it did not hold the information requested by Mr Gallagher’s fourth question which was: “4. What is the average time delay for a Stage Two [investigation] to commence each year for the last three years?” 5. Having received HCC’s response, on the same day - 6 August 2018 - Mr Gallagher emailed HCC asking: “Could you therefore provide the number of Stage Two investigations that commenced during each of the three years together with the length of time each was delayed?” and stating his belief that this information should have been supplied under section 16 FOIA. 6. HCC logged this correspondence as a fresh request. 7. Mr Gallagher emailed HCC the following day to ask for an internal review into the handling of his original request. HCC carried out such a review but only in respect of the timeliness of its response. HCC informed Mr Gallagher of the outcome of its review on 21 August 2018. 8. On the same date, Mr Gallagher emailed HCC, arguing that HCC had failed to explain why all the information he had requested had not been provided, and claiming that HCC had breached its section 16 FOIA duty. 9. HCC carried out a further internal review, covering both question 4 of Mr Gallagher’s original request dated 9 July and his follow-up request dated 6 August 2018. 10. On 21 September 2018, HCC informed Mr Gallagher that “while the answer to your question could have been determined by interrogating each case, because this was not routinely reported on or already held in the format requested, complying with your request would have required creating information that was not already held”. However, HCC went on to state that it had recently compiled information about Stage Two complaints as part of a separate project. HCC therefore now held information within the scope of the second request – and had disclosed that information to Mr Gallagher which would allow him to answer question 4 of his original request. 11. On 24 September 2018, Mr Gallagher complained to the Information Commissioner (‘the Commissioner’) about the way HCC had handled his request for information. 12. Mr Gallagher asked the Commissioner to consider whether HCC had met its responsibilities under sections 10 and 16 FOIA. 313. The Commissioner found that HCC had not breached its duties under either section 10 or section 16 FOIA, and on 14 November 2018 issued Decision Notice FS50788702 to that effect. 14. On the same date – 14 November 2018 – Mr Gallagher appealed to the Tribunal, seeking a fresh Decision Notice covering FOIA sections 10, 16 and 77. Commissioner’s response and Mr Gallagher’s reply 15. On 11 January 2019, the Commissioner responded: (a) She does not oppose the appeal to the extent it relates to section 10 FOIA. She accepts Mr Gallagher’s argument that, contrary to HCC’s original response, HCC did at the time of the original request, hold the information requested at part 4, and that HCC failed to provide that information within the statutory timeframe. While HCC did not apparently hold the ‘average’ value as Mr Gallagher had requested, it did hold the ‘building blocks’ (i.e. the raw data) which would have enabled it to provide, without a great deal of additional work, the information requested. According to the Commissioner’s (non- statutory) guidance even if the ‘building blocks’ need to be manipulated to a reasonable level of judgement and skill, the information will sometimes be held. The Commissioner concedes that this was such a case, and the information was held but not provided within the statutory timescale. (b) There was no breach of section 16 FOIA because, had the Commissioner found a breach of section 10 FOIA in her Decision Notice, she would not have gone on to consider section 16. HCC should have confirmed that the information was held, and either provided it or (if it were exempt from disclosure on some basis) refused to provide it. However, no section 16 FOIA duty would have arisen, and there could therefore have been no breach. (c) As for an offence arising under section 77 FOIA, the Commissioner considered that there was no evidence to suggest that a criminal offence had occurred – but in any event, the Tribunal does not have the power to investigate, or order an investigation into, matters arising under section 77 FOIA. Only the Commissioner, or the Director of Public Prosecutions, can institute proceedings under section 77 FOIA. In light of her changed position on section 10 FOIA, however, the Commissioner said she would look afresh at the section 77 FOIA issue, separate from the appeal proceedings. (d) It may be possible to dispose of the appeal by way of a consent order, a draft of which the Commissioner attached to her response. 16. Mr Gallagher replied on 15 January 2019 that, in view of the Commissioner’s proposal to reconsider section 77 FOIA, he had no issue with that aspect of his appeal being removed from these proceedings. 17. However, on 5 February 2019, Mr Gallagher emailed the Tribunal that he objected to the draft consent order, and if a fresh investigation by the Commissioner was not acceptable, the Tribunal should consider whether the Decision Notice complied with 4sections 10 and 16 FOIA. Mr Gallagher stated that HCC had still not released information in response to his original request, and argued that responses to any other FOIA requests should not have any bearing on whether information should be released in response to his original request. The Law Section 1(1) FOIA: general right of access to information held by public authorities 18. The duty of a public authority to disclose requested information is set out in s.1(1) FOIA as follows: (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) To be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) If that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. Section 10 FOIA: time for compliance with request 19. Section 10 FOIA provides: (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a public authority must comply with section 1(1) promptly and in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt. ... 20. Section 84 FOIA (Interpretation) provides that “information” (subject to sections 51(8) and 75(2)) means information recorded in any form. 21. When deciding whether a public authority has provided requested information, the normal civil standard of proof applies – namely the balance of probabilities (Linda Bromley v. the information Commissioner and the Environment Agency (EA/2006/0072)). Section 16 FOIA: Duty to provide advice and assistance 22. Section 16 FOIA provides: (1) It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it. …. The powers of the Tribunal 23. The powers of the Tribunal to determine appeals are set out in section 58 FOIA: 558. Determination of appeals (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. … The burden of proof 24. The burden of proof rests with the appellant (in this case, Mr Gallagher) in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion. Discussion and reasons 25. Mr Gallagher does not suggest that the Commissioner should have exercised her discretion differently. 26. Mr Gallagher was correct not to challenge the Commissioner’s exercise of discretion, because this is not a case where the Commissioner’s discretion was engaged. The exercise of discretion does not apply to breaches of section 10 or section 16 FOIA. 27. As for section 10, the Commissioner concedes that her Decision Notice was wrong in law for the reasons set out in paragraph 15(a) above. 28. We agree that on the balance of probabilities, the information Mr Gallagher requested by question 4 of his request on 9 July 2018 was held by HCC at the time of his request – albeit in the form of raw data “building blocks”. We reach this conclusion because this information was provided to Mr Gallagher in response to his follow-up request on 6 August 2018, made very soon after his original request. 29. The Commissioner’s non-statutory guidance on determining whether information is held states at paragraph 23: “…a public authority will hold the information if it holds the necessary building blocks and they can be identified, retrieved and manipulated using only a reasonable level of judgement.” 630. We believe that, had HCC – or the Commissioner – followed that guidance, both HCC and the Commissioner would have concluded that the degree of skill and judgement needing to be applied to the ‘building blocks’ to provide the information Mr Gallagher requested was not such as to constitute the creation of new information. Thus, we are satisfied that, in accordance with the guidance, the information was held by HCC at the time of Mr Gallagher’s original request. 31. We therefore conclude that HCC’s failure to provide such information in response to Mr Gallagher’s original request (though HCC did provide it a short time thereafter in response to his follow-up request), means that HCC did not respond to the request within the timescale required by section 10 FOIA. 32. We therefore find HCC did breach section 10 FOIA. 33. As for section 16, in our view, had HCC responded to Mr Gallagher’s original request as it should have done, no duty to provide advice and assistance to Mr Gallagher would have arisen. 34. However, we consider that HCC should have been aware that Mr Gallagher would not know how their records were structured and whether or not they would have already calculated an 'average time delay' for Stage Two investigations. 35. To assist public authorities, a Code of Practice provides guidance which it is desirable for them to follow in the discharge of their duties under section 16 FOIA. The Code current at the time of Mr Gallagher’s request said section 16 FOIA includes providing 'assistance to the applicant to enable him or her to describe more clearly the information requested'. If HCC had explained in their response to Mr Gallagher’s question 4 why the information was not held, we consider that HCC would then have realised that due to the small number of records, they should follow the Commissioner's guidance on holding information because the average value could easily be calculated. 36. We note that Mr Gallagher stated in his Grounds of Appeal that he “only asked for averages as I thought it may minimise the data that HHC needed to provide”. As the Commissioner states in her response to this appeal, Mr Gallagher now has the ‘building blocks’ to enable him to make the calculation for himself. In all the circumstances, we agree with the Commissioner that it would be a disproportionate use of resources for a public authority now to have to undertake this calculation itself. 37. We do not agree with Mr Gallagher’s conclusion that HCC was in breach of section 16 FOIA, nor do we accept his proposition that - notwithstanding HCC’s later provision of information in response to his follow-up request - HCC should also be required to answer question 4 of his original request. 38. For the reasons set out above, Mr Gallagher has not satisfied us that the Commissioner’s Decision Notice was wrong in law as regards section 16 FOIA or in not requiring HCC to take any further steps, notwithstanding its breach of section 10 FOIA. 7Conclusion 39. We allow this appeal to the extent that the Commissioner’s Decision Notice was wrong in law with regards to section 10 FOIA. 40. However, we uphold the Commissioner’s Decision Notice with regard to section 16 FOIA, and her decision not to require HCC to take any further steps - and dismiss the appeal to that extent. 41. We accordingly issue a substituted Decision Notice in the terms set out in paragraph 1 above.

"381","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0182 Heard at Bolton Magistrates’ Court On 24 April 2019 Before JUDGE MELANIE CARTER TRIBUNAL MEMBERS MALCOLM CLARKE & JEAN NELSON Between MARTIN L ADEDEJI Appellant And INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant, Mr Adedeji in relation to a request made under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) for information from various doctors at the Dicconson Group Practice (“the GP practice”) in Wigan. Mr Adedeji emailed his request to the GP practice on 12 March 2018.2. The background to this matter is that until 2011, Mr Adedeji was registered as a patient at the GP practice. On 3 August 2009 there was an appointment between Mr Adedeji and a doctor at the GP practice, about which Mr.Adedeji subsequently made a formal complaint. On 12 March 2018 he wrote to the GP practice making the following request: “...Please inform me whether or not you hold the information specified below, and if you do please send me a copy of all the recorded information you hold fitting the criteria of my requests. 1) . I am requesting a copy of all information, that you first processed between 01/08/09 and 28/01/10, regarding the; 'suggestion of racism within our organisation.' comment that Dr [Redacted], in her 16/06/10 letter, claimed was made during a 03/08/09 surgery Appointment. 2) . I am requesting a copy of all information, that you first processed between 01/08/09 and 28/01/10, regarding the; 'suggestion that a person’s ethnicity may impact on the health care they receive ' comment that [a particular doctor], in her 16/06/10 letter, claimed was made during a 03/08/09 surgery appointment. To assist you the 16/06/10 letter (which I have attached to this email) I refer to above was a letter written, by [a particular doctor], in response to a 2010 BME service user complaint. 3) . Please inform me whether or not you hold the following information and if you do please send me a copy. I am requesting information regarding the practice meeting minutes you were ordered to provide by a 2016 decision of the FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: [number redacted] GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS). In respect of the minutes you provided to the appellant please send information of how long it took you to redact the practice meeting minutes:- a) Of each year for the period 2009 to 1 September 2015. b) For all the years in total for the period 2009 to 1 September 2015.” On 24 April 2018, the GP practice replied that in relation to parts 1 and 2 of the request, the ‘response was prepared following a review of the consultation notes held within your medical records’. As regards part 3, the GP practice responded that it did not keep a record of the time taken to process the documents following receipt of the 2016 Tribunal decision. 3. On 7 May 2018 Mr Adedeji complained to the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner). The Commissioner in brief concluded that on the balance of probabilities, the GP practice did not hold any information falling within the scope of the request. Mr Adedeji complained to the Commissioner on the basis that there was information held that was not being disclosed. 4. By a Decision Notice dated 27 July 2018, the ICO found that on the balance of probabilities, the GP practice had disclosed all information it held that fell within the scope of Mr Adedeji's request and that it did not hold any further information. 5. Mr Adedeji has appealed the Decision Notice to this Tribunal. His grounds of appeal are first, that the Commissioner was wrong to find that the GP practice had provided all the information it held about parts 1 and 2 because, in brief, the GP practice was not to be believed and, in particular, the requested information was processed as part of a 2010 formal complaint to the GP practice, and because it’s own policy specified arecord retention period of 10 years in respect of complaint information’; second, it had no ‘valid reason’ for not saying whether it does or does not hold information relevant to parts 1 and 2, and they should now do so; and thirdly, that the Commissioner was wrong to find that the GP practice had provided all the information it held about part 3, the amount of time taken to make redactions to minutes to be provided to him further to the 2016 Tribunal. In support of this latter assertion, the Appellant provided a copy of an email dated 18 March 2016 to the Tribunal and an email of 28 July 2016 to ‘Medical Leeds’. These emails were not provided to the Commissioner until these proceedings. The Applicable Law 6. The role of this Tribunal is to consider whether the Decision Notice is in accordance with law or whether the Commissioner ought to have exercised her discretion differently in finding that the GP practice did not hold the information requested - see section 58 of FOIA. 7. When determining whether or not information is held, the Commissioner and the Tribunal apply the normal civil standard of proof, on the balance of probabilities. This position was supported in the Tribunal case of Linda Bromley v the Information Commissioner and the Environment Agency EA/2006/0072 and the Tribunal has repeatedly confirmed that this is the appropriate test: see, for example, Malcolm v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0072 at [24]; Dudley v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0089, at [31]. Decision 8. The Tribunal paid close attention to the letter from the GP in response to Mr Adedeji’s original complaint to the GP practice, dated 16 June 2010. The request for information which is the subject of this appeal, focussed on two statements in the letter which, Mr Adedeji was clearly seeking to understand better. The request required the GP practice to disclose any information giving rise to the statements made in the letter with regard to the suggestion of racism within the organisation and the impact ethnicity may have on healthcare. The Tribunal could understand why Mr Adedeji would wish to see this information under parts 1 and 2 of the request, but in summary, could see no reason not to believe the evidence of the GP in question and the GP practice itself that there was no further information held. 9. The retention policy was for information to be held for 10 years and the request was approximately 8 years after the complaint had been made. Thus, if information had been recorded in relation to racism within the organisation or the impact ethnicity might have on healthcare, and it was not held 8 years after creation, that would indeed be a breach of the GP practice’s own policy. However, even if contrary to it’s own retention policy any such information had been deleted and not retained, a breach did not necessarily mean that as a matter of fact, further information was held. The real question, it appeared, was whether the existence of the policy meant that the GPpractice was not to be believed in stating there was no underlying information held relating to the statements in the letter. Mr Adedeji prayed in aid the fact that he had been told that his complaint had been discussed at a meeting, but in relation to which there were no minutes. He also relied upon the BMJ Guidance provided to the Tribunal which in essence said, if something has not been recorded it did not happen. Mr Adedeji further relied upon the 24 April 2018 response to the Commissioner which stated that the letter had been put together after “consultation notes” had been reviewed. Mr Adedeji had in fact seen those consultation notes further to a subject access request under the Data Protection Act 1998 and confirmed that there was nothing there relating to the two statements in the letter of 16 July 2010. Indeed, at the hearing, Mr Adedeji confirmed that if he had had the disclosure further to the subject access request prior to this particular Decision Notice, he would not have appealed. 10. Regardless of this, the Tribunal set out to satisfy itself whether the Commissioner had erred in concluding that no further information was held. It noted that the 24 April response referred to the 16 June letter as “following a review” of, not that it was “based on” the consultation notes. In any event, the request for information in relation to potential racism within the organisation and the impact of ethnicity related to a period that pre-dated his complaint on 29 January 2010 (hence a review of the consultation notes for the purposes of the 16 June letter was only part of the story) – he was enquiring what information the GP practice held, in effect, in relation to the subject matters of the two statements from as far back as 1 August 2009 (two days before the original appointment with the GP). 11. Mr Adedeji’s suggestion that the GP practice was not to be believed was in part based on its prior failures to comply with FOIA (2016 Tribunal decision) and since then oddities with regard to the practice minutes. Mr Adedeji had subsequently discovered that minutes from 2013/4 had been deleted, those being years that he was particularly interested in. Further to the subject access request he had seen minutes for 15 July 2014, which he had been told had been deleted. Mr Adedeji, in these circumstances, was concerned to see how long the redacting had in fact taken (see below), as a piece of the jigsaw which would help him understand whether there were in fact further minutes in existence which had not been disclosed. 12. There was however, in the Tribunal’s view, no persuasive evidence that the GP practice was not telling the truth or was mistaken in stating that there was no further information held in relation to parts 1 and 2 of the request. The previous failures in compliance with FOIA and seeming patchwork of practice minutes were in the Tribunal’s view, more likely a reflection of disorganisation and possibly a lack of understanding of obligations, than a deliberate defiance of the law or an attempted cover up. 13. In relation to the second ground of appeal, Mr Adedeji had argued that the GP practice should now confirm or deny if information was held for parts 1 and 2 of the request. As he was, however, aware that the GP practice was stating it held no further information, the Tribunal declined to hold that the Commissioner should have ordered the GP practice so to deny. This would not achieve anything in the circumstances and theCommissioner was entitled to decide within her discretion not to order any steps to be taken. 14. With regard to part 3 of the request, the GP practice had advised the Commissioner that one individual redacted the minutes in question and that person had not recorded how long this took. As noted it had previously been ordered by the Tribunal in 2016 to produce redacted minutes of the practices’ meetings. Once the Tribunal had issued its decision in July 2016 requiring the minutes to be disclosed in redacted form, the Commissioner argued that there would appear to be no business reason to record how long redaction actually took, particularly as recording such information would be likely to increase the amount of resource devoted to the task. 15. The first of the two emails produced by Mr Adedeji, dated 18 March 2016, and obtained by Mr Adedeji as a result of the previous Tribunal’s decision, was from the GP practice to the Commissioner providing an estimate of how long it would take to carry out the redactions in relation to the 6 years of GP practice minutes required to be produced. The estimate, it was calculated would lead to an overall figure of approximately 231 hours. 16. The second email, dated 28 July 2016, which Mr Adedeji had also been given further to the previous Tribunal’s decision, was the GP practice stating that it had taken 4.5 hours, to process the minutes for 2009 and 2010. This did not, the Commissioner argued, fall within the scope of part 3 of the request. She argued that it did not provide the requested information or show that the information about how long redaction was taken was being recorded (much less that it was retained). The Commissioner could “envisage a situation in which the author of the email was describing something which she had been doing at that time and was fresh in her mind. It does not necessarily follow that the information requested by the Appellant was recorded or, even if it was, that it has been retained”. 17. The Tribunal was of the view however that this email was technically information the GP practice should have disclosed further to this request. On the basis of 4.5 hours to redact minutes for two years, it appeared that the GP practice may have been estimating a materially inflated amount of time in the first email mentioned above, to carry out the required redactions. The estimate in the first email was however no more than that - an estimate - and did not, in the Tribunal’s view, indicate anything more than that their estimate may have been incorrect. Moreover an estimate of time taken did not fall within the scope of part 3 of the request. 18. The Tribunal did not moreover consider the inconsistency between these two emails, even taken with the oddities in relation to the deletion of minutes, led to a conclusion that the GP practice were not to be believed. As noted above, this was more likely to be a situation in which the GP practice had not been rigorous in its estimation of the time redaction would take. It did however have this one email which, in the Tribunal’s view, fell within the scope of part 3 of the request as it did record the time taken for partof the redaction process. This should have been disclosed (whilst noting that the Commissioner could not have known about this email until the course of the proceedings and after the Decision Notice had been issued). 19. It did appear that the GP practice had failed on more than one occasion to comply with its FOIA obligations and that this had been pointed out by the Commissioner, a previous Tribunal and now this Tribunal. Mr Adedeji was entitled to have his rights under FOIA taken seriously and complied with in accordance with the law. 20. As such, this appeal was upheld in relation to this one aspect, that is, that the Decision Notice is amended to reflect that the email of 26 July 2016 should have been disclosed. The Tribunal did not however order the GP practice to take any steps as Mr Adedeji had this information already. 21. This is the unanimous decision of the Tribunal.

"451","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0183 and 0184 Heard at Fleetbank House on 25 February 2019 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Pieter de Waal Michael Jones Between Iain Orr Appellant and The Information Commissioner 1st Respondent and Department for International Development 2nd Respondent The Appellant represented himself The Information Commissioner was unrepresented 1The Department for International Development (DFID) was represented by Ms Galina Ward DECISION AND REASONS Introduction 1. These two appeals relate to the Appellant’s requests to DFID for information about (i) the terms of reference for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by an external expert appointed by DFID; and (ii) information about flight tests undertaken to measure turbulence and wind shear before agreeing the location, design and runway alignment of the airport. The Commissioner explained the background in both the decisions under challenge as follows:- 2. St Helena is a small self-governing UK overseas territory in the South Atlantic, previously only accessible by sea. DFID provides financial and technical assistance to St Helena as one of three Overseas Territories which are eligible for official development assistance. 3. DFID’s aims for the UK’s financially dependent Overseas Territories are to ensure the provision of basic services and to help them become economically self-sufficient, with the aim of reducing and eventually removing the need for subsidies from the UK government. 4. In 2004, DFID commissioned a feasibility study into building an airport on St Helena, with the rationale that improved access would help reverse economic decline by opening the island to increased revenues from tourism. In 2010, DFID commissioned a report from consultants looking at options for access to improve St Helena’s economic and social sustainability. In 2011, the St Helena Government signed a design, build and operate fixed price contract with Basil Read, a South African construction company to build an airport on St Helena. The total budget for the project was set at £285.5 million. 5. The airport had planned to start operating in May 2016. However, test flights in April 2016 revealed dangerous wind conditions on the airport approach, an effect known as ‘wind shear’. Although the airport subsequently handled a small number of flights, the wind conditions precluded the operation of the planned commercial service. These began 2in October 2017 following further testing of the wind conditions on the island. 6. The House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts published a report in December 2016 about the St Helena Airport project. The report was critical of DFID’s management of the project, in particular its failure to foresee and address the impact of difficult wind conditions on landing commercial aircraft safely. Preliminary 2. DFID made an application at the start of the hearing, pursuant to rule 14(6) of the Tribunal rules, that certain parts of the witness statement of Mr John Gordon (discussed in detail below) and other documents (not those within the scope of the requests) should be withheld on the basis that they explain how release of the disputed material at the time the requests were made would have adversely affected the course of justice. We accept DFID’s submission that ‘Releasing details of the dispute now would undermine the ...process which has rightly existed for this extended period in order to ensure that the Department could achieve the best outcome possible’. The nature of the dispute referred to is described in the body of the decision below. In those circumstances that application was granted. The requests and response 3. The Appellant submitted the following request to DFID on 22 October 2017: ‘This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Regulations for full information of the terms of reference and any subsequent instructions - including the allocation of supporting financial, legal and human resources - for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by [name redacted], as indicated by the DFID Secretary of State when she told the International Development Committee on 19 December 2016: ‘I have appointed an external individual expert to undertake a detailed review of the project and programme. I think that is right. That, to me, speaks to transparency and value for money.’ 3""Please also provide information on when [name redacted] work was completed; or, if not yet completed, whether there is a date by which he has been asked or is expected to complete and present this review."" 4. DFID’s initial response on 20 November 2017 was to refuse to confirm or deny whether it held any information on the basis of regulations 12(3) and 13(2)(a) (personal data exceptions) of the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). The Appellant contacted DFID on 1 December 2017 and asked for an internal review of this response. His email also asked: ‘Would it help if the question were rephrased? Eg: “This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act, for full information of the terms of reference and any subsequent instructions for work in relation to the St Helena Air Access Project to be undertaken by an external individual expert appointed by the DFID Secretary of State, as she informed the International Development Select Committee on 19 December 2016. Please also provide information on whether this detailed review has been completed or, if not, whether there is a date by which the external expert has been asked - or is expected - to complete it."" 5. The Appellant then included some clarifications of his new formulation, which in fact appear to refer to matters upon which he was hoping for disclosure which go beyond that which was included in either of the formulations of the request set out above. The Appellant said: That formulation is shorter, purely to avoid further misinterpretations. Let me make explicit that I do not expect ‘full information’ to include any sums to be paid into any individual’s personal bank account. It would, however, be helpful to know if the expert was given a budget for this ‘detailed review’, including, for example, provision for supporting staff or for any visit to St Helena; as well as other expenses to facilitate access to UK and St Helena officials and commercial companies who have at any stage been involved in the project. I would, of course, understand if names of individuals or companies were redacted - for good reasons, such as protecting personal data – from the terms of reference and subsequent instructions given to the reviewer. Given earlier delays and misinterpretations, I would be grateful if DFID’s review of this further refusal could be completed as speedily as 4possible; and if you could also confirm now (before starting your review) that you understand from my suggested rewording that I am not seeking any personal data whose disclosure is not permitted under the FOIA.’ 6. After a number of further contacts DFID provided a substantive response on 1 February 2018 when it said:- (a) The request fell under the Environmental Information Regulations. (b) DFID confirmed that it held a copy of the Terms of Reference (ToR) and that the review had been completed. (c) DFID confirmed that the overall budget allocated to the expert was £29,750 of which £19,663 was paid inclusive of VAT and all travel expenses. (d) However, DFID considered the actual ToR to be exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(a) EIR (adverse effect on international relations), 12(5)(b) EIR (course of justice) and 12(5)(e) EIR (confidentiality of commercial and industrial information). 7. The Appellant also submitted the following request to DFID on 22 October 2017: ‘This is a request, under the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations, for information about: [i.] test flights undertaken to measure turbulence and wind shear, as recommended by Atkins in Section 7.57 of their report on the St Helena airport and [ii.] about the decision to discontinue such flights after the first one had been completed.’ 8. In relation to this request, DFID responded on 20 November 2017. In relation to (i), DFID explained that it held information falling within the scope of this request but considered it to be exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(b) and 12(5)(e) EIR. 59. In relation to (ii), DFID explained that it did not hold any information falling within the scope of this request. This was on the basis that ‘the original plan only intended for one test flight to be undertaken. Therefore, no “decision” was ever made to “discontinue such flights after the first one had been completed”. 10. Following a request by the Appellant for DFID to carry out an internal review of the decision, DFID informed him of the outcome of the internal review on 12 January 2018 as follows:- (a) With regard to request (i), DFID remained of the view that the entirety of the information falling within the scope of this request, namely a document entitled ‘Flight Trials Report’ dated May 2007, was exempt from disclosure on the basis of regulations 12(5)(b) and 12(5)(e) EIR. (b) DFID concluded that this document was also exempt on the basis of regulations 12(5)(a) (international relations) and 12(3) and 13(2)(a) EIR. (c) Additional searches had been carried out in relation to (ii), including searches to see if there was information as to why there was only one day of flight-trialling completed at the pre-design stage of developing the St Helena Air Access project, and no information had been located. Therefore ref 12 (4)(a) EIR was relied upon. 11. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner about the way his requests had been dealt with. The Commissioner dealt with the complaint primarily by considering the exception in regulation 12(5)(b) EIR which relates materially to a situation where disclosure would adversely affect ‘the course of justice or the ability of a person to receive a fair trial…’. 6Relevant legislation 12. The relevant parts of regulation 12 EIR reads as follows:- 12.— Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if– (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. (3) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that– (a) it does not hold that information when an applicant's request is received (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect– (a) international relations, defence, national security or public safety (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; …. (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest; Decision notices 13. We adopt what the Commissioner said about reg 12(5)(b) EIR in the relevant decision notices as follows:- 7The threshold for establishing adverse effect is a high one, since it is necessary to establish that disclosure would have an adverse effect. ‘Would’ means that it is more probable than not, ie a more than 50% chance that the adverse effect would occur if the information were disclosed. If there is a less than 50% chance of the adverse effect occurring, then the exception is not engaged. The course of justice element of this exception is very wide in coverage, and can encompass, amongst other types of information, material covered by legal professional privilege (LPP). 14. In the first request case (the ToR request) the Commissioner concluded as follows:- (a) The ToR attracted legal professional privilege (LPP), specifically litigation privilege, and therefore disclosure of the privileged material would have an adverse effect on the course of justice for the purposes of reg 12(5)(b) EIR. (b) That although there was a significant public interest in the disclosure of the information, given the criticisms of the airport project, the public interest in maintaining the exemption was greater because of the need to maintain the principles of LPP, and the acute impact on the course of justice where the disputed information related to live legal proceedings. 13. The Commissioner reached a slightly different conclusion in the second case (the Flight Trials request) and found that although the information did not attract LPP:- Nevertheless, the Commissioner is satisfied that disclosure of this information still risks undermining DFID’s position in the ongoing legal case. Moreover, the Commissioner is satisfied that such a risk could be categorised as harming the course of justice given the broad way in which this concept is interpreted when applying this 8exception. Furthermore, the Commissioner is satisfied that the likelihood of harm occurring if the withheld information was disclosed is one that meets the threshold of more probable than not. She is therefore satisfied that regulation 12(5)(b) is engaged. The Commissioner has elaborated on her reasons for reaching this conclusion in a confidential annex, a copy of which will be provided to DFID only. 14. Much the same analysis was carried out by the Commissioner as in the ToR request decision, in deciding that the public interest favoured non- disclosure. 15. In relation to the Appellant’s argument that there must be further information about the decision to discontinue the test flights after the first such flight, the Commissioner accepted DFID’s response that it had carried out relevant searches and there was no further information held, and that therefore regulation 12(4)(a) EIR was correctly relied upon by DFID. The appeals 16. The Appellant appealed both these decisions. 17. In essence, in relation to the ToR request, the Appellant argued that the balance of the public interest had been wrongly struck in favour of non- disclosure, and that it was unfair that there was closed material in the case that he was unable to see. 18. In relation to the Flight Trials request, the Appellant argued that reg 12(5)(b) EIR had been wrongly applied, and that disclosure would not lead to an adverse effect on the course of justice. He argued that it was implausible that DFID did not hold further information in relation to ceasing of the flight trials, and criticised the lack of breadth of the searches that had been carried out by DFID. 9Subsequent developments 19. Matters have now moved on. The first thing that happened was that DFID prepared a statement dated 11 January 2019 from Mr John Gordon, who is Head of the Overseas Territories Department at DFID. That statement is heavily redacted in places, but the open part of the statement explained that DFID no longer relied on litigation privilege for withholding the ToR and therefore did not support the Commissioner’s finding on this issue. This was as a result of ‘[h]aving considered all the contemporaneous documents surrounding the creation of the ToR’. Mr Gordon explained that:- It is certainly the case that a primary purpose of the ToR was to help identify any negligence by DFID’s third party advisors and provide critical insights for consideration of possible legal action…But this was not the only purpose: other purposes included assisting in identifying a solution to the problems faced, and considering whether DFID’s internal processes had been sufficiently robust in dealing with the matter. I am not now able, based on my review of the documents, to say that any of these was the dominant purpose of the ToR. 20. However, Mr Gordon goes on to explain that DFID continued with its reliance on reg 12(5)(b) EIR on the basis that disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice. The full reasons for this have been redacted and are only available in a closed version of the statement. 21. There have been further developments. DFID now says that all the information requested has, in fact, been disclosed. In its skeleton argument for the hearing it says, in relation to the ToR request, that the ToR itself was provided to the Appellant on 30 January 2019. 22. In relation to the Flight Trials request, DFID reaffirmed that it does not hold any information in relation to the decision to discontinue test flights after the first one had been completed as only one test flight was recommended. The information about the test flight that was carried out is contained in the Flight 10Trials Report (FTR) which has now also been provided to the Appellant on 30 January 2019. 23. DFID supports the initial decisions made in relation to the requests as, at that time, it was engaged in a live dispute in which Government Legal Division commercial litigation section had been instructed and it was concerned that disclosure of the FTR and ToR would prejudice the effective conduct of that dispute. That position was time sensitive and was kept under review, with the result that it was concluded that the information should be released on 30 January 2019. 24. It is argued that this disclosure decision does not undermine DFID’s previous position, ‘but rather underlines the careful consideration that was given to the relevant issues at all times’. The hearing 25. At the hearing, DFID applied to have the appeal struck out on the basis that it was ‘academic’ now that the information had been disclosed. That application was refused and there is a separate judgment which deals with that point. 26. The main point that the Appellant wanted to make was that, in his view, there must be more information within the scope of the requests that DFID should disclose, especially in relation to ‘further instructions’ following the ToR, and further information about discontinuance of the flight trials. 27. He also submitted that the exemption in reg 12(5)(b) EIR had been wrongly applied in relation to both requests. 28. Although DFID had served the statement of Mr John Gordon, Mr Gordon did not attend to give oral evidence. We explained to the Appellant that in these circumstances the Tribunal would consider the weight to be given to 11the statement, in the light of submissions made by the Appellant. We should also note that much of the witness statement was redacted and so it could only be considered at the hearing by the Tribunal in a closed session with DFID’s representative. 29. That closed session took place and at the end of it a gist was provided to the Appellant to the effect that the Tribunal had been taken to passages in Mr Gordon’s statement that explained the nature of the confidential dispute resolution procedure that DFID was engaged in, and the reasons why DFID was concerned that disclosure of the requested information would have had an adverse impact on that process. The gist stated that the Tribunal had asked questions to test the substance of DFID’s concerns. The Tribunal also looked at the material that had been subject to a s14(6) FOIA order, to see whether it assisted in identifying the extent of the searches carried out by DFID. Discussion The ToR appeal 30. In relation to the ToR appeal it was not strictly a point in issue as to whether DFID held further information that it had not disclosed. This is because the appeal relates to the Commissioner’s decision as to whether DFID can rely on the exemption in reg 12(5)(b) EIR or not in relation to the information requested. DFID says that it has now disclosed the information in scope. However, we do note that DFID says that there were no further ‘instructions’ issued in relation to the ToR, and we have no reason to doubt that. We note that that does not mean that there is necessarily no further information at all which relates to the ToR, simply that there is nothing that can be described as ‘instructions’ so as to be within the scope of the request 1231. In relation to the ToR request, DFID initially claimed the protection of reg 12(5)(b) EIR on the basis that the ToR were covered by LPP. LPP constitutes the rules which seek to protect the confidentiality of legal communications. There are two types of LPP – legal advice privilege and litigation privilege – and DFID claimed that the latter applied to the ToR. For litigation privilege to apply there must be confidential communications or documents which were created for the dominant purpose of litigation. The Commissioner explained DFID’s initial position as follows at paragraph 16 of the decision notice:- DFID explained that the withheld information attracted LPP and was relevant to a live and ongoing legal case. It argued that disclosure of the withheld information would provide an indication of arguments relevant to this case, the strength or weaknesses which DFID might have, thus unbalancing the level playing field under which adversarial proceedings are meant to be carried out. DFID was of the opinion that disclosure of the withheld information would therefore harm the course of justice. 32. With reference to the withheld information in this case, the Commissioner was of the view that DFID’s claim to LPP was made out. On the basis of Mr Gordon’s statement (as described above) it seems to us that that conclusion can no longer be maintained. However, it also seems to us that all Mr Gordon is saying in his statement is that there was more than one primary purpose for creating the ToR, which necessarily rules out the reliance on LPP. But given the wording of regulation 12(5)(b) EIR (which means that the exemption applies where disclosure would ‘adversely affect… the course of justice’) DFID, in our view, is still able to rely on the factors as summarised by the Commissioner in paragraph 16 of the decision notice, for the purposes of withholding the ToR at the time the request was made. 33. We have had the benefit of considering the withheld material in this case, reading the unredacted witness statement of Mr Gordon, and receiving closed oral submissions, and we are satisfied that the regulation 12(5)(b) EIR exemption applies, notwithstanding that litigation privilege is now accepted 13to have been wrongly claimed. It seems clear to us that the ToR were contained in a confidential document which was produced for a primary purpose (albeit not the primary purpose) of litigation, and that disclosure at the time of the request would have adversely affected the course of justice (that is, that there was a greater than 50% chance that the adverse effect would occur) while resolution of the dispute was at issue. 34. Although we have considered closed documentation and submissions, there is now a fair amount of information available to the Appellant to explain DFID’s position (and our conclusion) and the Appellant is now able to read the contents of the ToR document itself. Thus:- (a) As mentioned in the open ‘gist’ (see above), DFID have explained that they were engaged in a confidential dispute resolution process. (b) Mr Gordon, in the open part of his statement, explains the context of possible legal action for negligence against third party advisors. (c) Paragraph 16 of the decision notice summarises further the position as to why disclosure would have harmed the course of justice. 35. In these circumstances it does not seem to us that we need to expand on our conclusion in a closed annex to this decision. 36. However, that is not the end of the matter, as the exemption in reg 12(1)(b) EIR requires that, where it is engaged, a test should be carried out to ascertain whether the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. As the Commissioner notes in the decision notice, the provisions of regulation 12(2) EIR state that a public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure, and as a Tribunal, we must do the same. 1437. As emphasised by the Appellant, there is an obvious public interest in disclosing as much information as possible about public expenditure where it appears that there is a strong argument that something went seriously wrong with the commissioning and planning of the airport at St Helena, and the need to understand exactly what happened. The Appellant argues that the Public Accounts Committee’s report into the planning of St Helena Airport project contained a damning assessment of the project. We agree with the Commissioner that disclosure of the ToR ‘would provide the public with an insight into the steps DFID has taken to investigate how the project was managed’. 38. In the decision notice the Commissioner was able to rely on the ‘clear and significant public interest in upholding the long-established principle of legal professional privilege’ when deciding where the public interest balance should be struck. Now that the claim for LPP is not being relied upon by DFID, the Tribunal cannot take exactly the same route. However, we do still give significant weight to the public interest in avoiding an adverse effect on the course of justice, having found that disclosure would have had that effect. 39. In particular, as noted, a primary purpose of the ToR was to provide a basis for possible legal action against third party advisors and at the time of the request there was an ongoing confidential dispute resolution procedure in which DFID was engaged. It seems to us that at the time of the request, there was a greater public interest in enabling the course of justice to continue, rather than in disclosing the ToR. Of course, there came a time when the position changed and the information was disclosed, but that post-dated the relevant decision-making which we have to consider. 40. On that basis we do not allow the appeal in relation to the ToR. The Flight Trials request 1541. We have come to a different conclusion in relation to the Flight Trials request. As Mr Gordon sets out in his open statement, and as we can now see from the disclosed report, the report relates to flight trials carried out in May 2006. It has never been argued that LPP attached to this document. It cannot be argued that the purpose of the FTR was in any way related to possible litigation. We cannot find that disclosure of the FTR at the time of the request would have adversely affected the course of litigation (that is, that there was a greater than 50% chance that this would occur), and therefore the exception in reg 12(5)(b) EIR does not apply. There is nothing in the withheld material that leads us to a different conclusion. 42. Having reached this conclusion, in our view it is unnecessary for us to consider the public interest test. 43. Other than an issue about personal data (which we address below), we do not understand that any other exception is now relied upon by DFID. 44. In relation to the Appellant’s argument that DFID had not carried out sufficient searches in relation to the discontinuation of the flight trials, we accept the evidence from Mr Gordon in his statement as to the searches that were carried out, and that these searches contained the appropriate search terms for the information. It also makes sense to us that, as has been explained, as only one test flight was planned, there would not be information available about the discontinuance of the flight tests. Personal data in the Flight Trials request 45. Having reached the conclusion that the FTR should have been disclosed at the time of the request, it is necessary for us to consider information which remains redacted on the FTR which was eventually disclosed in January 2019, on the basis that the redacted parts constitute personal data. DFID explains 16that it is relying on reg 12(3) and reg 13(2) EIR to withhold the personal data of three ‘observers’ on aircraft during the flight trials. DFID says:- ‘The information is personal data because it consists of names and details of the individuals’ flying experience and employment and so identifies the data subjects’. 46. Having considered the relevant material it seems to us that if names, years of experience, and specific employment details are redacted, then it ceases to be possible to identify individuals from it, and in which case the information disclosed ceases to be personal data which qualifies for possible exemption. 47. Thus, the relevant bullet points, under the heading ‘Observers’ would read:- There were three observers on the aircraft as follows:- • [Redacted] an ex RAF Sqn Ldr with [redacted] years experience in aviation and an expert in airport design [redacted]. • [Redacted] and ex RAF Wg Cdr with [redacted] years experience flying Hercules and other aircraft [redacted]. • [Redacted] from Air Safety Support International (ASSI), an experienced pilot [redacted]. 48. In conclusion, therefore, we allow the Appellant’s appeal in relation to the FTR, on the basis that reg 12(5)(b) EIR does not apply, and to the extent that the FTR is redacted as indicated above it does not include personal data for the purposes of reg 12(3) EIR. Stephen Cragg QC Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 7 April 2019 Promulgated: 17 April 2019 1718"
"501","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0154 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Mr David Wilkinson Mr Narendra Makanji Heard at the Reading Tribunal Centre on 21 January 2019 Between Ben Dean Appellant -and- The Information Commissioner (1) NHS England (2) Respondents Attendances: For the Appellant: In person For the 1st Respondent: Did not appear For the 2nd Respondent: Mr Robin Hopkins 1DECISION AND REASONS BACKGROUND 1. The Appellant is a doctor who works for the NHS. On 16 July 2015 the then Secretary of State for Health, Mr Jeremy Hunt, made a speech in which he explained the government’s interest in 7-day services in the NHS (7-day NHS). He made the claim that around 6,000 people every year lose their lives ‘because we do not have a proper 7-day service in hospitals’ and that there was a markedly greater percentage likelihood of a patient dying who is admitted, for example, on a Sunday rather than on a Wednesday. 2. The speech was made in the context of the proposed introduction of new contracts with consultants and junior doctors for NHS work, with the proposals causing controversy. 3. Six weeks after the Secretary of State’s speech an academic study on weekend mortality rates was published by Freemantle and others (Freemantle 2015). In short, that study concluded that there may be many reasons why mortality rates were higher at weekends, not least that there is a tendency for weekend admissions to include a higher proportion of patients with high risk conditions. 4. In summary, the Appellant and others have had concerns about the source of Mr Hunt’s comments in his 2015 speech, as Freemantle 2015 had not been peer-reviewed or published at the time of the speech, and did not, in any event, support the assertions made by Mr Hunt about the link between increased mortality at weekends and the need for a ‘proper 7-day service in hospitals’. 25. The Appellant and a colleague have made a large number of FOIA requests of the Department of Health and NHSE with the aim of establishing the source of Mr Hunt’s information used in the 2015 speech. 6. In a previous Tribunal decision (Dean and Sturgeon v IC, Department of Health and another (EA/2016/0140) (26 May 2017)), the Tribunal had to consider a request made by the Appellant in September 2015 to the Department of Health (not NHSE) for information about how Mr Hunt had got to know about Freemantle 2015 before it was published. In the course of its decision, the Tribunal concluded that it was satisfied that Mr Hunt had received information in conversation with Sir Bruce Keogh of NHSE who was drawing on a previous Freemantle report published in 2012 (see paragraph 33 of the decision). The Tribunal also noted that Freemantle 2015 in fact discussed a figure of 11,000 more people admitted to hospital on weekend days dying than on other days of the week (paragraph 34), and that Mr Hunt would have been more likely to cite this figure in his speech if he had been aware of it (paragraph 35). 7. The Tribunal had heard evidence that a company called Deloitte had been advising NHSE in 2014 and 2015 on the ‘weekend effect’ and in March 2015 figures from the latest analysis were shared with senior health service and medical policy personnel, including personnel from Deloitte, and that Deloitte had also carried out work calculating excess deaths (paragraph 25), but the Tribunal concluded that the Appellant’s request did not cover a request for information concerning Deloitte’s work. However, the Tribunal went on to say at paragraph 37:- 37. …. as we have explained, we can identify no written documentation within the scope of the request that the Department could be ordered to disclose, with the result that we uphold the Information Commissioner’s decision, it is possible that there may be material relevant to the Department’s reliance on the weekend effect and its general relevance to policy in a form produced by Deloittes. We accept this is a matter for another FOIA request. Dr 3Dean’s general arguments on the invalidity of both the existence of the effect and the policy based on it may apply with equal force to any claim that there are 11,000 excess deaths due to a weekend effect. The disagreement may or may not be capable of conclusion, although the published materials Dr Dean has cited appear to be very relevant. The more the arguments and analysis of all parties are exposed, the better chance of reaching a reasoned conclusion on an important matter and the better public understanding will be. THE REQUEST 8. It is against that background that on 12 October 2017 (4 ½ months after the Tribunal’s May 2017 decision and after some further correspondence), the Appellant wrote to NHS England (NHSE) and requested information in the following terms: “May I please: 1. See the email correspondence you hold relating to this 7DS briefing for the SoS. 2. See any slide packs created for this briefing in full. 3. See any meeting minutes relating to preparing for this briefing or the meeting minutes of the 7DS briefing of the SoS.” And “I would like to make the following request as regards the attached emails: As regards an email sent by [redacted] on page 21 on June 11th 2015 in which it states ""This is the latest pack"". 1. Please may I make a request to see this 'pack'. On page 34 an email from Deloitte states ""this should be 6700...."" 2. May I see the Deloitte slidepack which mentions the 6700 figure - obviously this may be the same pack as in the first request above, in which case this amounts to just one request.” 9. As can be seen, the request refers to slide packs which the Appellant clearly thinks are produced by Deloitte. As such, this request appears to be the request for information (this time to NHSE) that the Tribunal had said in the previous judgment was ‘a matter for another FOIA request’. 410. At this point we should pause and record that Mr David Wilkinson who sat on the May 2017 Tribunal (and so was an author of the judgment in that case), also sits as a tribunal member in the current appeal. We raised this with the parties and drew attention to paragraph 37 of the previous decision, but were told that there was no objection to Mr Wilkinson sitting on this appeal. Our view is that must be right: although the previous Tribunal correctly pointed out that a further FOIA request would be needed to request any Deloitte information that might exist, the Tribunal did not express a view at all as to whether such a request would be vexatious when considered at the time the new request was made (which, as will be explained, is the issue we have to consider in this appeal). 11. NHSE responded to the request on 9 November 2017 refusing to provide the requested information and cited section 14(1) of the FOIA. Following an internal review NHSE wrote to the complainant on 22 November 2017 and upheld its previous position. THE DECISION NOTICE 12. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner, who considered the application of section 14(1) FOIA in some detail in the decision notice dated 9 July 2018. The relevant parts of the decision notice show that that the Commissioner was satisfied that s14(1) FOIA was met on fairly limited grounds. Thus, the Commissioner explained at paragraphs 76-78 that given the interest in Mr Hunt’s statement it would be difficult to say that the Appellant is pursuing a personal issue, noted that the Appellant has not used abusive or aggressive language, that there is no deliberate attempt to annoy, and the request is not frivolous. In paragraphs 79-86 the Commissioner accepts that there are frequent requests, but the request is 5clear and does not lack focus. The Commissioner accepts, though, that a response to the request is likely to lead to further requests, and that dealing with unreasonable requests can place a strain on a public authority’s resources. The Commissioner continues:- 87. The Commissioner is not persuaded that the complainant is being unreasonably persistent as he is not attempting to reopen an issue which has already been comprehensively addressed by NHSE despite the previous responses provided. Furthermore, the Commissioner does not consider that the matter is ‘relatively trivial’ as this issue is of significant interest not only to junior doctors, but also the general public. 88. It is the Commissioner’s view that the key issue in this case is the burden imposed by the request on NHSE and whether the effort required to meet the request will be so grossly oppressive in terms of the strain on time and resources, that the authority cannot reasonably be expected to comply, no matter how legitimate the subject matter or valid the intentions of the requester. 89. The Commissioner does accept that the complainant has made a large number of requests which collectively have the 7DS as the main focus. This number is exacerbated when the other applicant’s requests are included. From the information provided to the Commissioner, there is no evidence that NHSE has informed the complainant that it considers he is acting in concert with the other individual. However, it is clear to the Commissioner that the two individuals referred to are known to each other. 90. Despite this NHSE has responded to the majority of them up until recently when it concluded that the request was now vexatious. 91. Although the latest request is not patently vexatious when taken in isolation the Commissioner acknowledges that any response is likely to result in further requests being made. 92. However the request has to be seen in the context of both the other requests made by the complainant himself and those of the other applicant identified by NHSE. The Commissioner accepts that the cumulative impact of these 59 requests has placed a significant burden on the public authority. 93. As referred to earlier, NHSE has devoted a significant amount of staff time dealing with the requests made by both applicants, roughly 6equating to between 128 - 220 days of staff time. 94. The Commissioner is satisfied that there would clearly be an impact on NHSE’s ability to manage requests from other applicants and disrupt the work of those in the policy and business areas responsible for the issues which the requests relate to. This is compounded by the fact that a response to one request may result in a new request being made. 95. The Commissioner has carefully considered both the NHSE’s arguments and the complainant's position regarding the information request in this case. The Commissioner has carefully reviewed all the information and evidence presented to her by both parties and finds that despite the request serving a serious purpose, it is part of a pattern of behaviour that has placed a significant burden on NHSE, to the extent that it can be deemed to be vexatious. She considers, that on this occasion, in all the circumstances of this case, NHSE is entitled to rely on section 14(1). 13. Thus, the primary basis upon which the Commissioner has found that the current request was vexatious is (a) the ongoing significant burden that has been placed on NHSE from the requests made, and (b) the fact that ‘a response to one request may result in a new request being made’. 14. The Commissioner mentions the previous Tribunal decision cited above in passing, but does not refer to the comments in paragraph 37, which are set out above. THE APPEAL 15. The Appellant states that his appeal relates only to the first part of his request (set out above, but repeated here for convenience):- “May I please: 1. See the email correspondence you hold relating to this 7DS briefing for the SoS. 2. See any slide packs created for this briefing in full. 73. See any meeting minutes relating to preparing for this briefing or the meeting minutes of the 7DS briefing of the SoS.” 16. The Appellant’s view is that it is the lack of transparency by NHSE and the Department of Health about the 7-day NHS and the announcement in 2015 which constitutes the main reason behind the level of requests he has made on the issue. He argues that NHSE has largely brought the burden of dealing with requests upon itself by the nature of responses it has made to requests. He notes that NHSE has submitted no evidence in relation to the level of resources necessary to respond to his requests. Understandably, he cites the last sentence of paragraph 37 of the previous Tribunal decision, to the effect that the ‘more the arguments and analysis of all parties are exposed, the better chance of reaching a reasoned conclusion on an important matter’. The Appellant says that since the previous judgment in May 2017 it has become clear that Mr Hunt was briefed by NHSE shortly before his 2015 speech and that that briefing included the Deloitte slides and analysis which had an analysis of the 6,000 avoidable deaths. 17. The Commissioner did not appear at the hearing but her response seeks to uphold the decision notice and notes NHSE’s unchallenged evidence that responding to the 59 requests of the Appellant and his colleague has taken between 128 and 220 days of staff time (NHSE at the hearing were content for the Tribunal to take the lower figure). The Commissioner highlighted the likelihood that further requests would follow on the same subject matter, and that the issue, where there were many requests, was not limited to whether this particular request could be answered without substantial burden. The Commissioner described the requests as ‘secondary’ as they follow on from what was said by a Department of Health witness at a previous hearing (see above). 818. NHSE has also responded to the appeal (as well as appearing at the hearing through counsel). The response emphasises the Commissioner’s finding that the requests are ‘part of an excessively burdensome pattern of requests on the same or very similar themes’ and arguing that NHSE is entitled to say ‘enough is enough’. NHSE accept that ‘Deloitte did, however, produce…a number of iterations of a ‘slide pack’ in order to facilitate internal discussions of issues relating to the proposed ‘7-day NHS’ ’. NHSE also confirmed in the hearing that the information sought by the Appellant is held by them. 19. NHSE produced a press release by NHS (in an iteration said to be dated 23 February 2016), which had confirmed Deloitte’s involvement and which had formed the basis for a request about the same by the Appellant on 24 February 2016. 20. NHSE provided details of the numerous requests made by the Appellant and his colleague. NHSE also produced a copy of a letter dated 1 November 2017 to the Appellant’s colleague in which the content of two of the Deloitte slides were reproduced, with the comment that:- ‘These extracts from the slide packs are the only aspects of the slide packs which directly relate to the calculation of the 6,700 figure. The remainder of the slide packs have no relevance to the calculation of the figure’. 21. Although NHSE accept that there is a public interest in the underlying issues surrounding the 7-day NHS , it is argued that that interest has now been served by disclosures that have already been made, and compliance with the current requests would not materially further the public understanding of the issues. Despite this, NHSE argue that, ‘there is no end in sight in terms of these FOIA requests’. Although his request is for 9specific documents, the requests are on the same theme as his previous multiple requests. THE LAW 22. In both the Decision Notice and her response to the appeal the Commissioner has set out in some detail the law on the meaning and applicability of section 14(1) FOIA, mainly based around the case of Information Commissioner vs Devon County Council & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC), which is uncontroversial and with which we agree. 23. Thus, section 14(1) FOIA states that “(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious”. Vexatiousness is not defined in section 14 FOIA, but it is immediately noticeable that it is the request that must be vexatious and not the person making the request. 24. The Commissioner’s guidance on section 14 FOIA states that it is designed to protect public authorities by allowing them to refuse any requests which have the potential to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. 25. The emphasis on protecting public authorities’ resources from unreasonable requests was acknowledged by the Upper Tribunal in the case of Dransfield (see above) when it defined the purpose of section 14 as follows: ‘Section 14…is concerned with the nature of the request and has the effect of disapplying the citizen’s right under Section 1(1)…The purpose of Section 14…must be to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA…’ (paragraph 10). 1026. Also in Dransfield, the Upper Tribunal took the view that the ordinary dictionary definition of the word vexatious is only of limited use, because the question as to whether a request is vexatious ultimately depends upon the circumstances surrounding that request. The Tribunal placed particular emphasis on the issue of whether the request has adequate or proper justification. As the Upper Tribunal observed: ‘There is…no magic formula – all the circumstances need to be considered in reaching what is ultimately a value judgement as to whether the request in issue is vexatious in the sense of being a disproportionate, manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA’. 27. Dransfield was also considered in the Court of Appeal (Dransfield v Information Commissioner and Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454) where Arden LJ observed at paragraph 68 that:- “…the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public… The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious.’ 28. The Commissioner’s guidance at the time of the decision notice also contains a list of indicators which, the Commissioner says at paragraph 14 of the decision notice:- ‘…may be useful in identifying vexatious requests…. In brief these consist of, in no particular order: abusive or aggressive language; burden on the authority; personal grudges; unreasonable persistence; unfounded accusations; intransigence; frequent or overlapping requests; deliberate intention to cause annoyance; scattergun approach; disproportionate effort; no obvious intent to obtain information; futile requests; frivolous requests’. 1129. The recent Upper Tribunal case of Cabinet Office v Information Commissioner v Ashton [2018] UKUT 208 (AAC) made clear that s14(1) FOIA can apply purely on the basis of the burden placed on the public authority, even where there was a public interest in the request being addressed and where there was a ‘reasonable foundation’ for the request. The case also confirmed the approach in Dransfield to the effect that the Tribunal should take a holistic approach, taking into account all the relevant factors, in order to reach a balanced conclusion as whether a particular request is vexatious: see especially paragraph 27 of the UT judgment in Ashton. DECSION AND REASONS 30. In this case we are of the view that the Commissioner has wrongly labelled the Appellant’s request of 12 October 2017 as vexatious. 31. We note that although the Commissioner has referred briefly to the Tribunal decision of May 2017 she has not referred to paragraph 37 (set out above and referred to by the Appellant in his appeal). In our view that paragraph does have some relevance. In deciding, in May 2017, on a request in relation to the 7-day NHS that had not been described as ‘vexatious’, the Tribunal recognised that there may be further information available which was outside the scope of the request it was considering, and that that a further FOIA request could be made for that. 32. We do not think that the Tribunal was recommending or encouraging a further request from the Appellant, but we do think that the fact that the Tribunal could identify further information that might exist is relevant to our consideration as to whether the request subsequently made can be described as vexatious. 1233. We also do not think that we can completely ignore the fact that the Tribunal finished paragraph 37, as described above, by suggesting that a reasoned conclusion and public understanding could be better achieved by arguments and analysis of all parties being ‘exposed’. This statement is reinforced by the sentiments of the Commissioner in the decision notice in the current case about the serious nature of the Appellant’s request and that he is not as he is not ‘attempting to reopen an issue which has already been comprehensively addressed by NHSE despite the previous responses provided’ as argued by NHSE. 34. However, and based on the case law, NHSE (which was not a party to the previous appeal) is entitled to rely on the issue of burdensomeness on its resources as the main argument for us to consider when deciding vexatiousness. Thus, we take into account the large amount of staff time which it is said the NHSE has spent on dealing with requests on the 7-day NHS issue already. We also take into account the large number of requests that the Appellant has made on this issue since August 2015, and the not unlikely prospect that the Appellant will continue to make requests if we find that the current request is not vexations. 35. There has undoubtedly been a burden of considerable time and cost to NHSE in dealing with the Appellant’s requests over the past few years. But we also note that in 2017 prior to the current request, there had only been two requests made by the Appellant. One of these was asking for numbers of people (and a list) who had been muted or blocked by the @NHSEngland Twitter (Answer: information not held). The other related to correspondence about the delay in publication of NHS data reported by the BBC, which led to the disclosure of six pages of emails. 36. It does not seem to us that this reflects a heavy ongoing burdensomeness leading up the present request. We also note the NHSE accepts that it does hold the information requested which suggests that the current request 13(which the Commissioner accepted ‘did not lack focus’) will not add significantly to that burden. We also take into account that NHSE is a large public authority with resources more able to cope with higher levels of FOIA requests than would much smaller public bodies. 37. It is also our view that, in accordance with the Commissioner’s findings in her decision notice:- (a) the Appellant has not used abusive or aggressive language; (b) there has been no deliberate attempt to annoy; (c) the request is not frivolous; (d) the request is clear and does not lack focus; (e) the Appellant is not being unreasonably persistent; (f) the Appellant is not attempting to reopen an issue which has already been comprehensively addressed by NHSE despite the previous responses provided; (g) the matter is not ‘relatively trivial’ as this issue is of significant interest not only to junior doctors, but also the general public. 38. That view is reinforced by the May 2017 Tribunal decision to the effect that public understanding and a conclusion on this issue is best achieved by exposure of arguments and analysis. 39. Weighing all these factors in the balance, and taking an holistic approach to the issue of vexatiousness, as we must by virtue of the cases of Dransfield and Ashton, it is our view that the importance of and public interest in the information requested (together with the other factors listed above) outweigh the undoubted burden faced by the NHSE in responding to the Appellant’s requests, and that therefore this request is not vexatious for the purposes of s14(1) FOIA. 1440. In reaching this decision on the particular facts that are in existence at the time of this request, we should not be seen as encouraging the Appellant to continue in his requests or that this decision means that s14(1) FOIA cannot be raised against him successfully in the future. It should be noted that Mr Hunt has now moved on from the role of Secretary of State for Health, and we understand that there are new studies which update the analysis of mortality figures at weekends. To an extent, then, it can be argued that things are moving on and the Appellant’s concerns about what happened in 2015 will largely be of historical interest. Certainly, it seems that the public interest will lessen as time goes on, and concerns about the burden on resources and time are likely to increase. CONCLUSION 41. On that basis, we would allow this appeal. Our understanding is that as a result of our decision, NHSE must now comply with the request for information, unless one of the exemptions in FOIA is made out.

SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Public authority: Bournemouth Borough Council Name of Complainant: Conor O’Luby The Substituted Decision The Public Authority did not deal with Mr O’Luby’s requests for information made on 16 July 2017 and 14 August 2017 respectively in accordance with Parts 2 and 3 of EIR in that the requests were not “manifestly unreasonable” and the Public Authority was not therefore entitled to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) to refuse to disclose the information requested and, in relation to the request dated 16 July 2017, they also failed to comply with their obligation under regulation 9(1) to provide reasonable advice and assistance. 2Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 Steps to be taken (1) In relation to the request dated 16 July 2017 no action is required. (2) In relation to the request dated 14 August 2017, the Public Authority must disclose the information requested by 5 February 2019. HH Judge Shanks 8 January 2019 3Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This appeal concerns two requests for information under EIR relating to a proposed development by Bournemouth Borough Council involving the construction of a new “grade separated” junction and link road from the A338 to Wessex Fields Business Park. The project is part of an investment programme designed to help improve the highways along the A338 corridor. The proposed development cuts across green belt and conservation area land and has environmental implications including (in its original form) the demolition of an ancient barn. It is clearly a controversial project: there is fear that it will destroy widely used public green space and increase traffic congestion and noise and air pollution. 2. The Appellant, Mr O’Luby, is the leader of a group called Friends of Riverside, which also includes other members of his family. The group has been in existence for some 30 years. It is strongly opposed to the project. Mr O’Luby is open in declaring that it is his intention to fight to delay and ultimately prevent the project to the best of his ability within the bounds of the law. He and other members of the group have made various requests for information over the period 17 March 2017 to 6 February 2018 which are set out in a document produced by the Council at pp159-162 of our bundle and which we describe below. Background facts 3. The plans were first announced in September 2016. It seems that the Council Cabinet approved funding for preparation of a planning application for the project at a meeting on 9 November 2016 and that it was anticipated at that stage that the application would be made in the summer of 2017. The application would inevitably be made by the Council to itself as the planning authority; this is a significant feature of the case since it is well established that, for obvious reasons, 4Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 there is a special duty of openness and transparency on the part of a Council in relation to such planning applications. 4. There was a public meeting on 16 March 2017 at which the Leader of the Council, John Beesley, answered questions about the project. Following the meeting Mr O’Luby’s mother made a request for information concerning land purchased by the Council in connection with the project. The request was answered on 13 April 2017. It was followed by a request made on 18 April 2017 for the documents relating to the purchase which was also met on 20 April 2017. On 22 May 2017 she asked for the documents prepared for the planning application for the project; the Council refused this request on 22 May 2017 on the basis that the information was still in the course of completion under regulation 12(4)(d) of EIR. 5. On 6 June 2017 Mr O’Luby requested correspondence between the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital and the Council relating to the project. This request was met in part with part being refused under regulation 12(5)(e) of EIR on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. 6. On 13 June 2017 Mr O’Luby asked for clarification of the structure and remit of the Development Services Directorate. This request was answered on 11 July 2017. We agree with him that this request was not really in the nature of a request under EIR or the Freedom of Information Act. On 15 June 2017 there was a request for information made by Wendy Sharp who is chairman of a local parish council; although relied on by the Council earlier in the proceedings they now accept that this request is not connected to the Friends of Riverside group. 7. On 16 July 2017 Mr O’Luby made the first of the requests for information which is in contention in this appeal. We set out its precise terms below; in summary Mr O’Luby wanted sight of any internal correspondence from Council officers raising concerns about the project. On 9 August 2017 this request was refused on the basis that it was “manifestly unreasonable” under regulation 12(4)(b). On 1 August 2017 another member of the Friends of Riverside made a similar request; 5Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 Mr O’Luby accepted that he had asked his colleague to make this request; on 24 August 2017 it was also refused under regulation 12(4)(b). 8. On 14 August 2017 Mr O’Luby made the second of the requests in contention; it was for correspondence relating to the project passing between Cllrs Beesley and Mike Greene (the Cabinet Member with responsibility for environment, transport and waste and the A338-Wessex Fields project) on the one hand and Council officers in the Planning Department and members of the Planning Board on the other. That request was also refused on the basis that it was manifestly unreasonable and vexatious under regulation 12(4)(b) on 6 September 2017. 9. On 2 October 2017 Mr O’Luby made a request for notes of discussions which had taken place between the Council and DEFRA about roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations. The Council’s document at p162 records that this request was met; we accept Mr O’Luby’s evidence that in fact the Council informed him that there was no note of the meeting available and that he subsequently sought and obtained a note of the meeting from DEFRA. 10. The original planning application was submitted on 15 December 2017. 11. On 6 February 2018 Mr O’Luby requested email correspondence passing between Council officers in the project team and those in the Planning Department within the preceding two months. Notwithstanding their stance in relation to the requests of 16 July and 14 August 2017 this request was met by the Council on 4 April 2018. 12. In March 2018 Sophie Edwards, a Senior Planning Officer who was case officer for the project wrote to the Programme Manager stating objections to the scheme. Mr O’Luby says that this letter was effectively “hidden” in the appendices to the impact assessment and only came to light some months later. He told us Ms Edwards resigned in the summer of 2018 and was replaced by an outside consultant called David Innes. 6Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 13. The planning application was withdrawn on 20 October 2018 and a similar revised application put forward the same day. The requests for information and the Council’s responses 14. The first request was made on 16 July 2017. Mr O’Luby asked for: …any correspondence written by Council officers during the last 36 months which raise concerns in relation to the A338-Wessex Fields proposals. I am aware that a number of council officers raised serious concerns previously about the Wessex Fields road building projects. Please also provide me with any replies to any concerns raised. 15. On 3 August 2017 the Council refused the request on the basis of regulation 12(4)(b) EIR because of the burden on the Council and because the unstructured and unindexed nature of the data in email accounts meant that the Council could not ensure that all the information would be captured by any search. It was said that that the request was vague and potentially covered 2,838 officers and that, even if the search was restricted to the seven officers most likely to have corresponded on the issue, to review all their emails over the period of three years would cost £543.75 per officer (a total of £3,806). 16. Mr O’Luby sought a review of this decision raising three points: (a) the search could be narrowed using “A338-Wessex Fields” as an identifier; (b) the fact that the Council was both applicant and decision-maker in relation to planning meant that the process should be fully open and transparent; and (c) the argument about unstructured data was tantamount to saying that any request for internal emails could be refused. The Council upheld the decision on 30 October 2017; the decision letter raised a new expense: it was said that email data more than three months old was stored off-site and that it would cost £2,775 to restore it. 17. The second request was made on 14 August 2017. It sought: 7Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 … all A338-Wessex Fields Link-related correspondence between Cllrs Mike Greene and John Beesley and (a) officers in the Planning Department and (b) members of the current Planning Board, for the period starting January 1st 2016 to the current date. 18. The Council also refused this request on the basis of regulation 12(4)(b). It stated that it had taken account the history of Mr O’Luby’s correspondence and similar requests by him and other members of the Friends of Riverside group relating to the A338-Wessex Fields proposal. It pointed out that the planning process was open and transparent and gave an opportunity to residents to comment. And it stated that the request would require a search of numerous email accounts which would involve an excessive diversion of resources involving a search of unstructured data. 19. Mr O’Luby requested an internal review of this refusal on 11 September 2017. It was not until 18 May 2018 (some months after the Commissioner had become involved) that the Council wrote to him upholding its position. It stated that the request was a blanket request which was fishing for information and that it would place a disproportionate burden on the Council and was designed to cause annoyance and was part of a campaign by the Friends of Riverside to disrupt the Council. Commissioner’s decisions and the appeals 20. Mr O’Luby complained to the Commissioner in relation to the first request on 4 October 2017 and in relation to the second request on 16 November 2017. The Council’s Information Governance Officer, Leah Dover, provided a very substantial response to the complaints on 13 April 2018 (pp 132-203 in our bundle). The Commissioner’s decisions were issued on 1 June 2018. 21. In relation to the first request she found that the Council had correctly applied regulation 12(4)(b) on the basis that the request was manifestly unreasonable due 8Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 to the significant burden imposed on the Council in terms of cost (para 46). In relation to the public interest balance she considered that the request was “insufficiently targeted to serve a defined public interest” (para 60) and that, taking account of the availability of information associated with the planning application in the normal course, the significant impact of complying with the request outweighed the public interest in compliance with the request. The Commissioner also decided that the Council had complied with regulation 9 of EIR (which requires it to provide reasonable advice and assistance to applicants) on the basis (it seems: the Commissioner did not expressly make this finding) that Mr O’Luby would have been able to refine the request himself to name specific officers but had chosen not to do so in order “to cause disruption to the Council” (see: paras 39-41 and 63). 22. In relation to the second request, she found that Mr O’Luby and other members of the campaign were “exhibiting a degree of tenaciousness and persistence in making their request, in an apparent attempt to find fault in decision making processes which the Council has taken” (para 38), that the second request may have involved an expansion of the first (para 41) and that compliance would place a disproportionate burden on the Council and its officers (para 44) and that it was “vexatious and manifestly unreasonable” (para 46). In relation to the public interest balance she found in effect that the burden of complying with the request outweighed the public interest in disclosure (see: paras 47-52). She found that the Council had breached regulation 11(4) in not providing its internal review until 18 May 2018. 23. Mr O’Luby appealed against both decisions. The Registrar directed that the two appeals should be dealt with together on 24 July 2018 and a hearing was later set for 28 November 2018. The Council did not seek to be joined to the appeal although Ms Dover’s substantial response to the Commissioner was before us in the papers. The Commissioner elected not to attend the hearing. As a consequence we heard oral representations only from Mr O’Luby. He struck us as an honest witness and, notwithstanding the evident strength of his feelings 9Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 about the project, as someone who was approaching matters in a reasonable and measured way. We accept his evidence that, although his firm intention was to prevent the project going ahead if he could, he would use only lawful and proper means to do so. 24. On the appeal it is for the Tribunal to review the position in the light of all the material now before us and to decide whether the Council was entitled in 2017 to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) to refuse to disclose the information requested and whether it provided reasonable advice and assistance in relation to the first request as required by regulation 9. If the Council was not entitled to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) we must also consider what steps they should now take. The relevant law 25. There is no issue that the information which Mr O’Luby was requesting was “environmental information” and that the relevant regime was therefore the EIR. The relevant provisions are as follows 5(1) Subject to … Part 3 of these Regulations, a public authority that holds environmental information shall make it available on request. … 9(1) A public authority shall provide assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to applicants … (2) Where a public authority decides that an applicant has formulated a request in too general a manner, it shall- (a) ask the applicant as soon as possible … to provide more particulars in relation to the request; and (b) assist the applicant in providing those particulars. … 12(1) Subject to paragraph (2) … a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if- (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraph (4) … and 10Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2)A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. … (4)For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that- … (b) the request for the information is manifestly unreasonable (c) the request for information is formulated in too general a manner and the public authority has complied with regulation 9 … 26. Thus, for a public authority to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) to refuse a request for information under EIR, the request must be “manifestly unreasonable” and the public interest in maintaining the exception must outweigh that in the disclosure of the information; and there is a presumption in favour of disclosure. 27. The scope of the exception provided by regulation 12(4)(b) was considered by the Court of Appeal in appeals from the Upper Tribunal in the familiar cases of Dransfield v IC and Craven v IC [2015] EWCA Civ 454. The Court was also considering the scope of the exemption under section 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 relating to “vexatious” requests. In summary the law can be stated as follows: (1) Although the expressions “vexatious” and “manifestly unreasonable” differ, it is difficult to see how the result in any case where regulation 12(4)(b) was relied on would differ in practice from a case decided under section 14 unless the public interest requirement in regulation 12(1)(b) led to a different result (see para [78]); (2) “Vexatious” connotes a “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” (see para [19]); (3) In considering whether such misuse of the procedure is established in any case all the circumstances must be looked at (see para [18]). 11Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 (4) It is helpful to consider four broad themes: (a) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (b) the motive (of the requester); (c) the value or serious purpose (of the request); and (d) any harassment or distress (of and to the staff) (see para [19]). (5) The previous behaviour of the requester and the number, breadth and pattern of previous requests are likely to be relevant in considering whether a request is vexatious, particularly in relation to the theme of the burden on the public authority (see para [20] and [69]). (6) In considering regulation 12(4)(b), the costs of compliance with the request can in principle be taken into account, so that the costs of complying with “an extremely burdensome request” could be the basis for concluding that a request was manifestly unreasonable, but again the exception could only be relied on if the public interest in maintaining it outweighed the public interest in disclosure of the requested information (see paras [83] and [29]). Conclusions on regulation 12(4)(b) The history of requests 28. We have considered the history of requests by members of the Friends of Riverside group set out under the heading “Background Facts” above. We do not think that this history in itself gives rise to any inference that the requests in issue were vexatious or manifestly unreasonable. The requests relied on by the Council before 16 July 2017 (in effect four in four months) are all sensible, timely and focussed and do not appear to have involved any difficulty for the Council. The request of 1 August 2017 was perhaps excessive in view of the outstanding request of 16 July 2017 but does not appear to have caused any further work in practice and the next request on 14 August 2017 was different in kind (relating as it did specifically to Cllrs Greene and Beesley). It is also significant that the Council appears to have dealt with two further requests (2 October 2017 and 6 February 2018) without any difficulty or suggestion that it was vexatious of Mr O’Luby to continue to make requests for information under EIR. 12Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 29. If the Commissioner intended to suggest at para 38 of her decision notice in relation to the second request for information (when referring to “the tenaciousness and persistence” of the group in making requests) that the history did give rise to such an inference we would therefore disagree with her. The first request 30. The main point relied on by the Council in relation to this request was the cost of compliance but before the Commissioner it was also suggested that Mr O’Luby had put forward his request in the way that he did in order to “cause disruption to the [Council]”. We consider these points in the context of the “four themes” referred to in the Dransfield case. 31. Burden and cost of compliance. The Commissioner accepted the figures relied on by the Council and we have no basis for doubting them as figures. However, we do not consider that it was open to the Council to rely on the cost (£2,775) of retrieving email data going back more than three months in this context: this extra cost apparently results from the fact that the Council has changed its email systems three times in three years and chosen to retain the data in a certain way as described by Ms Dover at p134. As for the cost of searching the mail boxes of each of the seven most relevant Council officers (£543.75 each), we do not understand why it would not have been open to the Council to apply the “A338- Wessex Fields” identifier as suggested by Mr O’Luby, rather than looking at every single email in detail. The relevant costs of compliance were therefore substantially lower than those relied on by the Council. 32. Furthermore, the Council accepted that they did not provide advice and assistance in relation to this request (see para 3 at p135 and also comment towards the bottom of p138 (“… we should have provided the applicant with advice and assistance …”)). It seems to us that the correct approach to a request like this (which Mr O’Luby accepts was “formulated in too general a manner”) was to engage with him constructively to find a way to refine the request so that he 13Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 could obtain the information he was seeking and, if that did not help, to rely on regulation 12(4)(c), which we have set out above. If the Council had adopted that approach we are satisfied Mr O’Luby would have reduced the three year period asked for and that there may have been other ways in which (notwithstanding his inability to provide names: see below) the request could have been refined if there had been a dialogue, such as confining the search to emails received by the Project Manager or her deputy bearing the A338-Wessex Fields identifier. 33. Motive for and value of request Mr O’Luby told us, as stated in his written representations put in before the hearing (on the eleventh page; unfortunately they are unpaginated), that the background to this request was that he was informed by someone that there were internal objections to the project by Council officers and his informant suggested that he make an information request formulated in the way it was; he was not told the names of any officers and was not at liberty to disclose the identity of his informant. We accept his evidence about this and we accept that his motive in making the request was to discover whether there were indeed such objections in order to assist in his campaign of opposition to the project. 34. We consider that in light of the controversial nature of the project and the fact that the Council was in the position of applying to itself for planning permission, this was a proper motive for making the request he did and we reject the suggestion that it was simply designed to cause disruption to the Council. In light of the objections to the project by Ms Edwards and her subsequent resignation which he also told us about (referred to on the seventh page of the written representations) the request may have had considerable value in practice, although it is obviously impossible for us to reach a firm view on that. 35. Harrassment and distress There is no suggestion that any Council officer has been caused harassment or distress by the requests and our perception was that Mr O’Luby’s approach was, as we say, measured and reasonable. 36. Taking account of all the circumstances and in particular those set out in paras 30 to 35 above we do not consider that the first request in issue can properly be 14Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 described as vexatious or manifestly unreasonable, whether on grounds of costs of compliance or more generally, and we disagree with the Commissioner’s view on this issue. The second request 37. We have set out the basis for the conclusion of the Council and the Commissioner that this request was manifestly unreasonable at paras 18, 19 and 22 above. 38. Burden and cost of compliance The Council did not expressly rely on the cost of compliance in relation to this request, although Ms Dover states at p138 that they could have. Although the request covers an 18 month period and there are 11 councillors on the Planning Board and 40 officers in the Planning Department we consider that the focus on correspondence only with the two named councillors and on the topic A338-Wessex Fields would mean that the process of searching for material answering the request would not have been particularly expensive or difficult. 39. Motive for and value of request Mr O’Luby explained to us that the two named councillors are the leading proponents of the project and that he suspects that they may be exerting undue pressure on fellow councillors and officers in relation to the planning application and that the purpose of the request was to expose this if it was the case. He suggests that there is some basis for his suspicions. Ten of the 11 members of the planning board are in the same political party as the two councillors. In relation to Cllr Beesley it appears that an unrelated complaint of improper interference in the planning process was made against him in 2017 which was the subject of a police investigation at the relevant time (we are told it has since been dropped but that an internal investigation was to take place). In relation to Cllr Greene, Mr O’Luby points out that he has responsibility for the project but is not on the Planning Board but made a statement at a meeting of the Environment and Transport Overview and Scrutiny Panel on 13 July 2017 suggesting that he was in a position to defeat “the tiny minority” opposed to the project (see p72 of our bundle). 15Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 40. Having heard from Mr O’Luby in person we accept that his motive for the second request was as described and that it may have had some real value. It follows that we reject the Council’s case that the purpose of the request was simply a “fishing exercise” and designed to cause disruption to the Council. We also reject the suggestion that it was just a response to the Council’s rejection of the first request on the basis of regulation 12(4)(b) a few days earlier and the Commissioner’s suggestion at para 41 of her decision notice at p64 that it was an expansion of the first request: although both requests were for internal Council communications relating to the project they had a quite different focus and background. 41. We have also taken account of the points made by Ms Dover at p136 in this context. Mr O’Luby accepts that he is against the project and will use any lawful means to oppose it. His complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman relating to the exclusion of the public and press from part of the Cabinet meeting on 9 November 2016 may be a valid one and does not in our view bear on the requests for information we are considering. His implied statement at a meeting on 12 February 2018 that he was seeking to delay the planning process, including by judicial review, to the point where funding was no longer available does not undermine our view that his motive in making the second request was to expose possible undue pressure from the named councillors in relation to the planning process and that there was potential value in the request. 42. Harassment and distress Again, there is no suggestion that officers have been harassed or caused distress. 43. Taking account of all the circumstances and in particular those at paras 37 to 42 we also reject the notion that the second request was vexatious or manifestly unreasonable. The public interest balance 16Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 44. Since we have concluded that the requests were not manifestly unreasonable, strictly speaking the public interest balance does not arise but we have nevertheless gone on to consider this issue. 45. The public interest in maintaining the exception It is clear that the Council would have been put to some considerable trouble and expense if it had complied with the requests and/or provided the advice and assistance required by regulation 9 in relation to the first request, although as we have indicated we do not accept that it was as great as they maintain. There is no indication that compliance would involve any harassment or distress to officers. 46. The Council make a point in relation to the public interest that they are obliged to provide accurate information under EIR and that the nature of the requests (the first in particular) and the data they will be searching means that there is a danger that not “all the information would be captured” (see p136). We do not consider this to be a compelling point: the fact that the Council cannot guarantee to provide all the information coming within a request cannot be an argument for deciding that it would be better if they supplied none at all. 47. The public interest in disclosure The Council accept that there is a general public interest in accountability and transparency in respect of development matters, particularly in relation to developments of the size and impact of the A338-Wessex Fields link (see the response to the Commissioner at page 135 of the bundle). That public interest is a weighty one and Mr O’Luby is correct to point out that that is especially so where the developer and the decision maker are both the Council. We are not sure that the Council or the Commissioner paid sufficient regard to this additional feature. 48. The Council point out that the planning process itself is open and transparent and allows objectors to make their case and that there is a wealth of material in the public domain resulting from it. That is a highly relevant consideration but it is of little relevance in this case because, as we have found, the purpose of the requests was to expose matters which would not necessarily emerge in the formal 17Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 planning process but which, if true, it would be very much in the public interest to have in the open. 49. Balancing the competing public interests and in particular the factors we have identified above, we are satisfied that the public interest in disclosure of the requested information outweighed that in maintaining the exception in relation to both requests. The Council would not therefore have been entitled to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) even if the requests had been “manifestly unreasonable”. Disposal 50. Having had the benefit of hearing direct from Mr O’Luby (which in fairness the Commissioner did not), we have therefore reached the view that she was wrong in her conclusions on the applicability of regulation 12(4)(b) and we therefore allow the appeal in that respect. As we have indicated the Council appears to accept (rightly in our view) that they did not comply with regulation 9 in relation to the first request and we allow the appeal on this issue too. 51. Having allowed the appeals we must consider what steps are to be taken by the Council. In relation to the second request we see no objection to directing that the information is supplied as requested within a suitable period, which we consider to be four weeks from this decision. In relation to the first request, as we have indicated, Mr O’Luby himself accepted that it was too broad. It is not clear in such circumstances that the Tribunal has the means to require its enforcement and we have concluded that the best course is not to require any further action at this stage. We do not think that this prejudices Mr O’Luby’s position in practice: things have moved on and it will now be open to him if he sees fit to make a more informed and focussed request on the same theme which will be more helpful to him than trying to resurrect the existing request. 52. Our decision is unanimous. 18Appeal No: EA/2018/0125/7 HH Judge Shanks Date: 8 January 2019 19"
"621","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50639257 Dated: 14 September 2017 BETWEEN FAISAL QUREHSI Appellant THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent THE CABINET OFFICE Second Respondent Heard on the papers: 16-17 July 2018 Before HH JUDGE SHANKS ANNE CHAFER JOHN RANDALL Date of Decision: 12 October 2018 Date of Promulgation: 16 October 2018 Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 TRIBUNAL’S DECISION For the reasons which follow the appeal is allowed in part and the Tribunal issues the following substitute decision notice. SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Complainant: Faisal Qureshi Public Authority: The Cabinet Office Decision The Public Authority was obliged under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) to disclose the following parts of the identified documents pursuant to the Complainant's request dated 26 April 2016: Memo Geoffrey Howe to Prime Minister dated 31 August 1988: (a) Paras 1 and 2; (b) Para 3 down to “… formal speech” (c) Para 5 except for sentence 3 and sentence 4; (d) Last two sentences of para 6 (e) Para 7. Cable UK Embassy to FCO: paras 3 and 4. The Public Authority was however entitled to withhold the balance of any material it held coming within the request in reliance on section 23 and/ or 27 of FOIA. Action required The Public Authority must disclose to the Complainant those parts of the identified documents set out above by 2 November 2018. 2Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 REASONS Introduction 1. On 17 August 1988 President Zia Ul Haq of Pakistan along with the US Ambassador and others were killed in a plane crash near Lahore. The precise cause of the crash has never been conclusively established and the event remains a matter of considerable debate and discussion. 2. In 2013 the Appellant, Faisal Qureshi, a journalist who has been investigating the cause of the crash for many years, made a request to the Cabinet Office under FOIA for any documents they held relating to the death of President Zia and its aftermath. The Cabinet Office responded in a letter dated 30 September 2013 by relying on the ""neither confirm nor deny"" provisions relating to national security in sections 23(5) and 24(2) of FOIA: the writer of the letter stated: “I can neither confirm nor deny whether any of the information you have requested is subject to the exemptions at section 23(1) or 24(1) of [FOIA]”. 3. On 26 April 2016 Mr Qureshi requested the same information and the Cabinet Office responded by saying that they continued to rely on the same provisions as they had in 2013. After a review that decision was upheld on 27 June 2016. 4. Mr Qureshi complained to the Information Commissioner on 25 July 2016. After being pursued by the Commissioner for many months (inclucting by means of an information notice under section 51 of FOIA), the Cabinet Office finally issued a revised response to Mr Qureshi on 5 May 2017. They said that they had reviewed their files and located “additional information in scope of the request”. They disclosed four apparently innocuous documents including two versions of the cable containing Mrs Thatcher's condolences (see pp 96-101 of the open bundle). They stated that “some of the information held"" was exempt under section 27(1)(a), (c) and (d) and 27(2) of FOIA (foreign relations). And they stated that in continued reliance on section 23(5) and 24(2) they were “... unable to confirm or deny whether further information is held that would engage s23 or s24 of [FOIA]”. 5. Mr Qureshi remained unhappy with the response and asked for the Commissioner to make a decision under section 50 of FOlA. The Commissioner upheld the Cabinet Office's approach and Mr Qureshi has appealed. Our task on the appeal is, in effect, to decide, on the evidence now available, whether the Cabinet Office were entitled to respond to the request as they did on 5 May 2017. 6. In addition to the open appeal bundle we have been supplied with a closed unredacted version of the witness statement of Gareth Bayley, a senior civil servant who is now the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and with a closed bundle of the documents referred to by Mr Bayley in his statement. Contrary to the impression possibly created by paragraph 25 in the open version of Mr Bayley's statement, we make it clear that there were in fact six (not five) documents in the bundle and that the Cabinet Office confirmed when we sought clarification that these documents comprised the totality of the material held 3Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 which fell within the terms of Mr Qureshi's request and which had been withheld (ie they were not just “examples” of such documents). 7. The parties had agreed to the appeal being decided on the papers and we are satisfied that this was an appropriate way of dealing with it. Section 27 8. The Cabinet Office rely on section 27 specifically in relation to two documents. Given our decision on the contents of these documents we are able to identify them in this judgment: one is a confidential memo written to the Prime Minister by Geoffrey Howe (then Foreign Secretary) dated 31 August 1988 following his attendance at President Zia's funeral; the other is a copy of a cable from the UK Embassy in lslamabad to the Foreign Office which seem to have been sent soon after the crash and which is headed “Death of President Zia”. 9. Section 27 provides as follows: (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under [FOIA] would, or would be likely to, prejudice– (a) relations between the United Kingdom and any other State (b) … (c) the interests of the United Kingdom abroad (d) the promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of its interests abroad. (2) Information is also exempt information if it is confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom … (3) ... any information obtained from a State ... is confidential at any time while the terms on which it was obtained require it to be held in confidence or while the circumstances in which it was obtained make it reasonable for the State ... to expect that it will be so held. Section 27 provides a qualified exemption, so that it can only be relied on to withhold information if the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs that in disclosure of the information. It is well established in the case law that prejudice is “likely” for the purposes of section 27(1) if there is a “real and significant risk” of the relevant prejudice arising, not merely a hypothetical possibility. Such prejudice will arise if relations are made more difficult, or a particular diplomatic response is required to contain or limit damage which would not otherwise be required. 10. We have considered the contents of the memo and the cable in detail along with Mr Bayley's statement. We are satisfied that, with the exception of some passages which we refer to below, the information in those documents is “confidential” 4Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 information obtained from another state for the purposes of section 27(2) and/or frank commentary on the situation following the death of President Zia (including frank commentary on specific individuals) whose disclosure would involve a real and significant risk of relevant prejudice for the purposes of section 27(1). We have therefore gone on to consider whether the public interest in maintaining those exemptions outweighed that in the disclosure of the information. 11. As to the public interest in maintaining the exemptions, we note Mr Bayley's expertise, his account of the background in relation to President Zia and his assessment of the prejudice to the UK’s international relations if disclosure was made. We are fully cognisant of the time that has passed since the events in question (nearly 30 years at the time of the revised response) but we also take account of the continuing importance and sensitivity of the relationship with Pakistan in particular. 12. Mr Qureshi relies on the fact that the Cabinet Office initially relied only on sections 23 and 24 (and then apparently also in relation to the anodyne documents that were released to him in May 2017) as an indication that the subsequent reliance on section 27 cannot be justified. We agree that the Cabinet Office’s overall response to this request has not been satisfactory but they are entitled to rely on new exemptions and we have scrutinised their case appropriately. 13. Mr Qureshi also relies in this context on the fact that the US authorities have apparently disclosed a substantial amount of material relating to the cause of the crash which he has provided to us. We make two observations on this: first, decisions of the US government relating to their own relationship with a third country really cannot have any substantial relevance to decisions of this Tribunal about the relationship between the UK and that third country; second, as far as we can see, the US information relates mainly to detailed investigations as to the cause of the crash; the UK material we are considering consists, as we have indicated, of commentary and speculation at a high level of government in the immediate aftermath of the crash. 14. As to the public interest in disclosure, we acknowledge that the death of President Zia was an important event and that Mr Qureshi's investigations into it are in the public interest. However, although disclosure of the two documents would no doubt be of some limited historic interest and contribute in a general way to the transparency of the workings of the UK government at the highest level in relation to foreign affairs, it will be obvious from their timing that they are most unlikely to throw any light on the true cause of the crash, which we understand to be Mr. Qureshi’s main interest in making his request under FOIA. 15. Looking at the material in the light of all the circumstances and taking account of the public interest considerations we have identified, we are satisfied that, although neither public interest was particularly weighty, the public interest in maintaining the exemption under section 27 was real and outweighed that in disclosure. 16. As mentioned above, there are some fairly anodyne passages in the two documents which can be “disaggregated” where section 27 is not engaged. These are indicated in the substitute decision notice set out above and will need to be disclosed to Mr Qureshi. 5Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 Section 23/24 17. Section 23 provides: (1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the [security] bodies specified … ... (5) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would involve the disclosure of any information (whether or not already recorded) which was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the bodies specified … 18. Section 24 provides: (1) Information which does not fall within section 23(1) is exempt information if exemption from section 1(1)(b) [the duty to supply requested information] is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. (2) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, exemption from section 1(1)(a) [the duly to state whether information is held] is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 19. The section 23 exemption is absolute and so no question of weighing the public interest arises in relation to·that section. The case law recognises the broad scope and importance of the protection conferred by it and the width of the words “relates to”. Section 24 is a qualified exemption so that the public interest in maintaining the exemption has to be weighed against that in disclosure of the requested information. The Information Tribunal in the case of Baker v ICO and Cabinet Office (EA/2006/0045) approved the use of the exemptions in both sections 23(5) and 24(2) together as a means of avoiding any inference that a security body may be involved in a transaction. 20. We have set out above the replies given to Mr Qureshi by the Cabinet Office relying on sections 23/24. We are not sure whether the formula adopted (“I can neither confirm nor deny whether any of the information you have requested is subject to the exemptions at section 23(1) or 24(1) …”) is entirely apt given the terms of sections 23(5) and 24(2). But in any event we are satisfied that the revised response dated 5 May 2017 implicitly discloses that there is information held by the Cabinet Office coming within the terms of the request for which the exemptions at section 23(1) or 24(1) are relied on and we have therefore considered the app1icability of those sections. 21. It is sufficient to say that we are satisfied that any materia1 in the bundle which is not exempt under section 27 is covered by section 23(1). In the circumstances the Cabinet Office were entitled to withhold such material regardless of any public interest considerations. 6Appeal No: EA/2017/0224 Conclusion 22. For those reasons the appeal is allowed in part, although in substance the Cabinet Office has succeeded. HH Judge Shanks 12 October 2018 7"

The Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”), failed to comply with its obligations under section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. However, in view of the steps that the FOS has since taken, no further directions are made in relation to its obligations under section 16. Section 14(1) of the Freedom of Information Act is not engaged. Signed Anisa Dhanji Judge -2-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2017/0184 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by David Howells (the “Appellant”), against a Decision Notice (“DN”), issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 9 August 2017. It concerns a request for information made by the Appellant to the Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”), on 1 February 2017. 2. The Appellant’s request relates to allegations that had been made by the Appellant that the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (“RBS”), engaged in systematic document falsification to cover up wrong-doings. The allegations have received substantial press coverage. 3. In April 2011, the Appellant lodged a complaint with FOS about National Westminster Bank (“NatWest”), which is part of RBS. The complaint resulted in a decision in the Appellant’s favour in November 2013, with NatWest being required to pay compensation to the Appellant. 4. Subsequently, the Appellant made a series of requests to FOS under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), in relation to its handling of his complaint. 5. The information later provided by the FOS adjudicator included correspondence from NatWest, some of which bore a confidentiality stamp stating as follows: “This information contains CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION relating to [RBSG’s] commercial business activities which if disclosed by FOS to the complainant or to any third party would be likely to adversely affect our legitimate business interests”. 6. On 14 July 2016, the Appellant made a request under FOIA for information regarding the use of that stamp. FOS responded on 25 July 2016, stating that the information was not stored in searchable form, and it would therefore require a manual search. FOS also stated that the information was exempt from disclosure under section 12 of FOIA, because a manual search would exceed the specified cost limits. Pursuant to its obligations to provide advice and assistance under section 16 of FOIA, FOS said that it had considered whether it would be possible for the Appellant to refine the request, but having regard to the quantity of documents falling within the scope of the request, this was not possible. -3-7. On the same day, the Appellant submitted a revised request. On 5 August 2016, FOS informed the Appellant that it did not hold information falling within the scope of the revised request. 8. On 1 February 2017, the Appellant made another FOIA request (the “Request”), and it is that which is the subject of the present appeal. The Request Giving Rise to the Present Appeal 9. The Request was made on the following terms: “1. You stated that you and your colleague…have been “unable to locate any agreements, processes or communications with RBS or NatWest relating to them using a confidentiality stamp.” But can you please state for the record, as a matter of fact, that no agreement, processes or communications exists or has existed between the bank and the FOS relating to their use of a confidentiality stamp or statement, and relating to what evidence the bank submits to the FOS which the bank would like the FOS to consider confidential and not to be released to complainants or third parties. If such agreements, processes or communications exists or has existed, can you please provide me with a copy of them. 2. Has the confidentiality stamp that was used on the CES notes document the bank submitted to the FOS been use [sic] on other evidence in cases other than my own? Yes or no. 3. Was the confidentiality stamp which the bank used on the evidence it submitted to the FOS in my case used as standard by the bank (i.e. on a large proportion or a significant number of the documents and evidence the bank submitted to the FOS) between 2011 and 2014? Yes or no. 4. Was the same statement regarding confidentiality used as standard by the bank on emails the bank sent to the FOS (when it submitted evidence electronically) between 2011 and 2014? Yes or no.” 10. The letter also included a further subject access request under the Data Protection Act 1998, which does not fall to be considered in this appeal. 11. FOS responded on 16 February 2017, stating that: “[a]s we’ve previously explained to you – we don’t record whether or when RBS or NatWest has put a confidentiality stamp on documents/evidence that it has submitted to us – in a searchable form on our system. We also don’t record statements made by the bank about confidentiality in emails – in a searchable form. The only way to provide you with this information would be to individually search through every complaint we’ve had against RBS or Nat West since 2011 and then look through every document from the business.” -4-12. FOS went on to explain that it had received 102,642 complaints against NatWest and RBS between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016, and that the cost of complying with the Request would considerably exceed the cost limit of £450 (18 hours at £25 per hour). 13. FOS also stated that it had: “…considered whether we can provide you with any guidance as to how to refine your request – but given what you’ve asked for, we believe it’s unlikely the request can be refined sufficiently enough to bring it within 18 hours”. 14. The Appellant requested an internal review. He also asked FOS to carry out a broad sampling exercise in order to establish whether the confidentiality stamp was used in other cases. 15. FOS responded on 15 March 2017. It stated, in relation to the first part of the Request, that it did not hold any relevant information concerning agreements, processes or communications with NatWest/RBS relating to their use of a confidentiality stamp. 16. As to the remainder of the Request, FOS reiterated its reliance on section 12 of FOIA. It stated that a broad sampling exercise would not be reasonable, given the volume of documents at issue, and also that such a sample may not be an accurate reflection of all the cases involving RBS or Nat West. 17. In addition, taking into account the extent of the previous correspondence with the Appellant, FOS also invoked section 14(1) of FOIA (vexatious requests). The Complaint to the Commissioner 18. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner under section 50 of FOIA. The Commissioner investigated the complaint. 19. The Commissioner said, in her Decision Notice, that she was satisfied that compliance with the Request would require a manual review of documents from 102,642 cases, and that “the time required to do this would vastly exceed the appropriate limit”. On that basis, the Commissioner accepted that section 12 applied. 20. As to the Appellant’s suggestion that FOS should carry out a broad sampling exercise as a practical solution to the request, the Commissioner’s view was that under FOIA, a public authority is not required to carry out such an exercise. 21. In light of her conclusions in relation to section 12, the Commissioner did not go on to consider whether FOS could also rely on section 14. 22. The Commissioner considered whether FOS had complied with its duty to provide advice and assistance under section 16 of FOIA. In her view, -5-however, since FOS did not record the information requested in a searchable form, it was unable to provide advice as to how to refine the Request sufficiently to bring it within the 18 hour time limit. The Appeal to the Tribunal 23. The Appellant has appealed against the Decision Notice. The Appellant requested an oral hearing. 24. Prior to the hearing on 5 March 2018, we received a substantial bundle of documents. We have considered all the documents before us, including those received from the parties subsequent to the hearing, even if not specifically referred to in this decision. 25. The Commissioner did not attend the hearing. We have considered her position as set out in the Decision Notice, and in the Response to the Notice of Appeal. Grounds of Appeal and the Commissioner’s Response 26. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal are extensive. A number of issues raised by the Appellant are not within this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In brief, we take the relevant grounds of appeal to be that: • The Decision Notice contains a number of statements that are inaccurate and/or fails to refer to the Appellant’s own views on particular issues, including as to FOS’s reliance on sections 12 and 14; • FOS did not satisfy the criteria for reliance on section 12; • FOS did not comply with its duty to provide advice and assistance under section 16; and • The Commissioner failed to take account of the public interest in disclosure of the information requested. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 27. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal from a Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other Notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 28. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Decision Notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, -6-and indeed, as in this case, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. The Statutory Framework 29. Under section 1 of FOIA, any person who makes a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed if the public authority holds that information, and if it does, to be provided with that information. 30. The duty on a public authority to provide the information requested does not arise if the information sought is exempt under Part II of FOIA or if certain other provisions apply. In the present case, FOS has invoked sections 12 and 14. The Appellant relies on section 16. Section 12 31. Section 12 of FOIA provides that a public authority is not required to comply with a request for information if it estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the “appropriate limit”. 32. The “appropriate limit” is set out in the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (the “Regulations”). In the case of a public authority listed in Part I of Schedule 1 of FOIA, the appropriate limit is £600. In the case of any other public authority, the appropriate limit is £450. FOS is not listed in Part I of Schedule 1 of FOIA. It is therefore subject to the lower limit of £450. 33. Regulation 4 provides that a public authority may, for the purposes of estimating whether the cost of complying with a request for information would exceed the appropriate limit, take account only those costs that it “reasonably expects” to incur, in determining whether it holds the information, in locating the information, retrieving the information and extracting the information from a document containing it. The costs are to be estimated at a rate of £25 per hour. Section 14 34. Section 14 of FOIA sets out two grounds on which a public authority may refuse a request. The first is where the request is vexatious. The second is where the request is identical or substantially similar to a previous request that the public authority has already complied with. FOS has relied on the first. 35. Where section 14 applies, the public authority does not have to provide the information requested, nor indeed is it required to inform the requester if it holds the information. Section 16 36. Section 16(1) of FOIA requires a public authority to give advice and assistance to any person making an information request, so far as it would -7-be reasonable to expect them to do so. Under section 16(2), this is clarified to mean that provided a public authority conforms to the recommendations as to good practice contained in the Code of Practice (“the Code”) issued pursuant to section 45 FOIA, it will have complied with section 16(1). 37. The Code provides, in relation to the duty to advise and assist, that where the cost of compliance would exceed the appropriate limit, public authorities should: “…consider providing an indication of what, if any, information could be provided within the appropriate ceiling. The authority should also consider advising the applicant that by reforming or re-focussing their request, information may be able to be supplied for a lower, or no, fee.” 38. The Commissioner has highlighted that the obligation under the Code of Practice is to “consider” providing an indication of what information could be provided within the appropriate limit. The Commissioner says there will be cases in which the scope of a given request is so broad that it would not be possible for a public authority to provide meaningful advice as to how a request might be refined. 39. The Commissioner’s own guidance states that at a minimum, a public authority should indicate if it is able to provide any information at all, coming within the scope of the request, within the applicable cost limit. It goes on to explain that if the requestor understands the way in which the estimate has been calculated, it should help them to decide what to do next. 40. In All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition v Information Commissioner and Ministry of Defence [2011] UKUT 153 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal stated (at para 47), in relation to section 16, that in cases where the request for information is not “abusive or frivolous”, dialogue is contemplated between the public authority and the requester to “refine the request to what is realistically available within cost”. The Appeal Hearing 41. At the start of the hearing on 5 March, we confirmed with the parties that we had all the papers on which they intended to rely. We also ascertained that there was someone present from FOS who knew how its files are organised and would be able to give meaningful assistance on those issues. 42. We then sought to clarify the issues with the parties. During the course of those preliminary discussions, the Appellant said that he was no longer pursuing points 1 and 4 of the Request. Therefore, the only live issues in this appeal were now in relation to points 2 and 3, namely: 2. Has the confidentiality stamp that was used on the CES notes document the bank submitted to the FOS been use [sic] on other evidence in cases other than my own? Yes or no. -8-3. Was the confidentiality stamp which the bank used on the evidence it submitted to the FOS in my case used as standard by the bank (i.e. on a large proportion or a significant number of the documents and evidence the bank submitted to the FOS) between 2011 and 2014? Yes or no. 43. Having read the papers and having heard opening submissions from both parties, we invited them to consider whether, given an opportunity, they could resolve the remaining issues in this appeal. We made it clear that they were not obliged to take the opportunity. Both indicated their willingness to do so. We gave them the time requested. At the end of that time, we were informed that they were making good progress in discussing how the Request could be narrowed so that the Appellant could obtain a meaningful response within the prescribed cost limits. 44. In due course, they informed us that they had reached agreement as to the searches that would be carried out and the amount of time that would be spent on the basis of a reformulated and narrower Request, and further, that it was expected that on completion of that exercise, the Appellant would withdraw his appeal. 45. Directions were made for the agreement between the parties to be recorded and provided to the Tribunal, and also for the Tribunal to be notified by 30 April as to whether the Appellant was indeed withdrawing his appeal as anticipated, or whether the appeal was to continue, in which case the hearing would reconvene on 30 May. 46. In the event, we were informed by the parties on or around 30 April, that despite the searches undertaken by FOS on the basis agreed between the parties, the Appellant wished to pursue the appeal because he considered that he had not been correctly informed about FOS’s retention policy, and that in effect, relevant information had been destroyed. The Appellant’s position was that had FOS dealt with the Request properly when it was made, that information would still have been available. 47. The hearing reconvened on 30 May. The Appellant expressed his appreciation for the efforts that had been made by FOS on and since 5 March, and also made it clear that he was not alleging any impropriety by FOS. However, because he could not obtain the information that he considered he would have been able to obtain as at the date of the Request, he was seeking a finding from the Tribunal to the effect that FOS had not complied with its obligations under FOIA. 48. On behalf of FOS, Mr Davidson initially sought to argue (although not with great force), that the agreement reached between the parties disposed of the appeal. We pointed out to him, however, that the agreement reached was not akin to a consent order, and that it was always anticipated that if the Appellant chose not to withdraw the appeal, the hearing would proceed. Mr Davidson also submitted that the Tribunal should strike out the appeal under Rule 8(3)(c) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended), on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of the Appellant’s case, or part of it succeeding. We -9-declined. As will be clear from our findings, this is not a case in which there was no reasonable prospect of the Appellant’s case, or part of it, succeeding. 49. The hearing proceeded on the basis of submissions. There was no oral evidence on the basis that we had read the witness statements and there was nothing further to add. 50. FOS asked the Tribunal to make a finding in relation to section 14. Findings 51. Because of what had transpired at and after the hearing on 5 March, and the stage that had been reached between the parties by the time of the hearing on 30 May, the issues in dispute are narrower than they would otherwise have been. 52. The issues that we need to determine are in relation to sections 12, 14 and 16 of FOIA. We have already summarised these provisions above. A finding in favour of FOS under sections 12 or 14 would dispose of the appeal. However, at the parties’ request, we will reach findings on both. Section 14 53. We will begin section 14. Was the Request vexatious? If it was, then no obligations arise under section 16. As already noted, the Commissioner made no findings in relation to section 14. 54. FOIA does not define “vexatious”. However, there have been a number of decisions of the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) which have offered guidance as to what the term means in the context of information requests. The principles are perhaps most comprehensively set out in Information Commissioner v Devon County Council and Dransfield; Craven v Information Commissioner and Department of Energy and Climate Change, and Ainslie v Information Commissioner and Dorset County Council. 55. These cases all concerned section 14(1) of FOIA and/or the corresponding provision under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. They were heard by Judge Wikeley, who treated Dransfield as the ‘lead case’ and set out guidance on the meaning of “vexatious” which we have summarised below: • In the context of section 14, “vexatious” carries its ordinary and natural meaning, within the particular statutory context of FOIA. The dictionary definition of “vexatious” as “causing, tending or disposing to cause … annoyance, irritation, dissatisfaction or disappointment can only take us so far”. As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may well be vexatious, but it depends on the circumstances. • “Vexatious” connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure”. Such misuse may be evidenced in different ways. - 10 -• The Commissioner’s guidance that “the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause provides a useful starting point so long as the emphasis is on the issue of justification (or not)”. • The purpose of section 14 is to protect public authorities and their employees in their everyday business. Thus, consideration of the effect of a request on them is entirely justified. A single abusive and offensive request may well cause distress, and so be vexatious. A torrent of individually benign requests may well cause disruption. However, it may be more difficult to construe a request which merely causes irritation, without more, as vexatious. • An important aspect of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of whether there is an adequate or proper justification for the request. • A common theme underpinning section 14(1) as it applies on the basis of a past course of dealings between a public authority and a particular requester, is a lack of proportionality. 56. He stressed that this guidance is not intended to be prescriptive, and went on to say that the question of whether a request is truly vexatious may be determined by considering four broad issues or themes: • The burden on the public authority and its staff; • The motive of the requester; • The value or serious purpose of the request; and • Any harassment or distress caused to the staff. In paragraphs 29 to 45, he set out further guidance about each of these four themes. 57. The UT decisions in Craven and Dransfield were upheld by the Court of Appeal (“CA”). In Dransfield v ICO & Devon County Council; Craven v ICO & Department for Energy and Climate Change [2015] EWCA Civ 454, the CA added that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public, or to any section of the public. It went on to say (at para 68), that: “Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious”. 58. The CA also considered that where a motive can be established, that may be evidence of vexatiousness, although if a request is aimed at disclosure of - 11 -important information which ought to be publicly available, then even a “vengeful” request may not meet the test. 59. The UT has revisited the issue of vexatious requests in a number of further cases, including CP v Information Commissioner [2016] KUT 427 (AAC) which considered whether the FTT had correctly given weight to the nature of the requests made and had conducted an appropriately rounded assessment in the light of the high hurdle required to satisfy section 14(1), and whether the evidential basis for the FTT’s decision was sufficiently clear. The UT stressed that the high hurdle for satisfaction of the section 14(1) test requires an appropriately detailed evidential foundation of the course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority. While a compendious and exhaustive chronology exhibiting numerous items of correspondence is not required, there must be some evidence, particularly from the Commissioner, about the past course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority, which explains and contextualises them. The UT went on to say that a proper scrutiny of the number of previous FOIA requests requires more than a superficial count, and that section 14 should not be invoked without objective and careful justification. 60. We turn now to the facts of the present case, which for convenience, we will consider by reference to Judge Wikeley’s 4 themes set out at paragraph 55 above. 61. As to burden, clearly, the Request was much greater in scope than could have been dealt with under the cost limits. However, to that extent the public authority could rely on section 12, as FOS has done. In some cases, a request may pose an extremely costly burden for the public authority, but those burdens may not be ones which it is permitted to rely on for the purposes of section 12 because it goes beyond the location of the information and extends to the review of information for whether exemptions and redactions are required. We accept that section 14 can extend to such cases. and indeed this is made clear in CP, and again in Oxford Phoenix Innovation Ltd v Information Commissioner & Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency [2018] UKUT 192 (AAC), but there is almost no evidence before us as to that being the position with the Request. 62. The Request must, however, be seen holistically, in its totality, and in the context of the Appellant’s previous and likely future requests. This is inkeeping with Judge Wikeley’s guidance in Dransfield (at paragraph 29): “First the present or future burden on the public authority may be inextricably linked with the previous course of dealings. Thus the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor.” 63. While there is some evidence before us as to the Appellant’s other requests made to FOS (both under FOIA and DPA), it has not been presented along - 12 -the lines envisaged by CP (see paragraph 58 above), and indeed there is no real evidence that the number, breadth, pattern or duration of the previous requests have been particularly burdensome. As to future burden, the evidence does not suggest that the Appellant is on a fishing expedition. The Request had a specific purpose, and while the Appellant may make further requests, it is by no means evident that he will continue to do so. 64. As regards motive, value and purpose, for convenience, we have considered these two themes together because on the facts of the present case, as indeed in Dransfield, the issues are closely intertwined. 65. The motive of the requester may well be a relevant and indeed a significant factor in assessing whether a request is vexatious. Judge Wikeley noted in Dransfield, at paragraph 34, that “the proper application of section 14 cannot side-step the question of the underlying rationale or justification for the request”. 66. The Appellant’s assertions that the Request serves a public interest runs to many pages in his grounds of appeal, further submissions and witness statements, in which he seeks to explain the context and background to the Request. In his view: • The effect of the confidentiality stamp has been to make secret or confidential the detail of the banks’ submissions to the FOS on a complaint, even where those submissions concern details specific to the complaint and complainant, and are not a matter of genuine commercial confidentiality. • In his particular case, the bank’s submissions altered its own customer service records so as to misrepresent facts and put the bank’s case in the best light. • In preventing scrutiny of the bank’s submissions by the complainant, the confidentiality stamp allows misrepresentation or false statements to go unchallenged and allows complaints to be settled on the basis of a false representation of facts by the bank. • It is also wrong to represent the Request as a persistent pursuit of a personal grievance; the Request raises a matter of significant public interest. • the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) informed him that it would be a criminal offence under section 348 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, for him to reveal the fact that during the FCA’s investigations, RBS had admitted using the confidentiality stamp as standard practice between 2011 to 2014. He says therefore, that the only viable way for him to establish its use was through a FOIA request to FOS. 67. The Appellant also relies on the witness statement of Mr Andrew Keats, a former Metropolitan Police Sergeant, and now a Director of SME Alliance Ltd (“SMEA”) and Serious Banking Complaints Bureau Ltd (“SBCB”). He says - 13 -that SMEA is a not for profit lobby group and is an Associate Member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Business Banking. SBCB investigates serious complaints where dishonesty is alleged. He links the Appellant’s case to allegations that RBS staff in the Global Restructuring Group (GRG) have manipulated customer files so as to flatter RBS’s position during customer disputes. Mr Keats also comments on his own and others’ experiences of the dealings between GRG and small and medium businesses. He refers to 6 case studies presented to the FCA, who he says declined to investigate on the grounds that individual complaints are outside its jurisdiction. He suggests that malpractice is systemic and potentially widespread, as uncovered in the FCA’s 166 Report relating to GRG. He expresses surprise that the FOS and ICO have failed to take into account all the circumstances of the case in arriving at their decision on the Request. 68. FOS’ position on section 14 is briefly that: • The Appellant’s previous requests have been burdensome; they have been detailed, often set out a series of questions, and replying has simply led to follow up requests, addressing substantially similar points. • Dealing with his requests has diverted a small team from dealing with genuine requests; this is unfair to others, detrimental to the public interest and the efficiency of the FOS. • The Request is of little if any public interest; it relates to the practices of banks and whether they use confidentiality stamps or statements. • The stamps and statements are not determinative, and FOS will always reach its own view on whether a document is confidential or not. • The Appellant has no genuine interest in the use of confidentiality stamps and statements which do not deal with him. • The requests and correspondence between the Appellant, the FOS, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), the Independent Assessor and others, suggests that the Appellant’s primary motivation is not the information sought in each case, but rather he is seeking to pursue his underlying grievance in whatever forum he can. Section 14 is intended by Parliament to provide a bulwark against such personal crusades. 69. The FCA is not a party to the appeal. However, FCA’s letter of 18 January 2017 to the Appellant (at page 27 of the open bundle), states that the FCA investigated but did not agree with the Appellant’s view that the only reason for a bank to mark information as confidential is because records had been falsified. It also did not accept that records had been falsified in his case. The FCA letter covers various other strands of his complaint and concludes that it would not be proportionate to investigate the Appellant’s concerns further. The Appellant wishes us to record that he does not accept the FCA’s interpretation of his complaint or its decision. - 14 -70. We turn now to our findings. In this case, as in many others involving section 14, the Tribunal finds itself balancing the conflicting assertions of the parties without being in a position to make findings on the underlying substantive issue, in this case, as to whether confidentiality stamps or statements have in fact been used to cover falsified or misrepresented facts, shielding them from those making a complaint. It is not for us to review the FCA’s findings in the letter referred to at paragraph 69 above, nor would it be appropriate to express any view about the Appellant’s concerns underlying the Request. 71. Nevertheless, the issues raised about the use of the confidentiality stamp or statements, are clearly of potential public interest. It is important to public confidence that decisions by ombudsmen and regulators are seen to be based on a fair and balanced account of facts. We do not accept that the Appellant is pursuing a narrow private issue, with no wider interest in the information sought. He has given an exhaustive chronology of how he came to be concerned about the wider public interest issues, and why he questions perceived inconsistencies in the responses he has been given. He is supported on the wider public interest aspects by Mr Keats, whose evidence, though not tested by cross examination, we accept comes from a knowledgeable witness. 72. FOS has not sought to challenge factual particulars in the Appellant’s evidence, and has relied instead, in the main, on a broad characterisation of his requests and previous history. 73. While we make no findings on the issues in dispute between the Appellant and the FOS, we cannot conclude that the Request is a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure, nor that the information sought is of no value to the public or any section of the public. 74. Of course, having a justification does not mean that a request cannot be vexatious. As Judge Wikeley noted, in some cases, the value or purpose may dim over time and subsequent requests may not have a continuing justification. He described this as “vexatiousness by drift”. On the evidence before us, however, we do not find that the Appellant’s quest has become disproportionate to that original purpose. 75. Finally, although a finding of vexatiousness does not depend on there being harassment or distress of the public authority’s staff, vexatiousness may be evidenced “…by obsessive conduct that harasses or distresses staff, uses intemperate language, makes wide-ranging and unsubstantiated allegations of criminal behaviour or is in any other respects extremely offensive…” (Dransfield, at paragraph 39). 76. We do not have any evidence before us from any members of staff at FOS about the effect on them of the Request, nor any previous requests made by the Appellant. There is also nothing in the evidence before us to suggest that the Appellant’s conduct, language or assertions were such as to have given rise to harassment and/or distress. The presentation of the Request, and ensuing communications have not been in offensive or intemperate terms. - 15 -77. For all these reasons, and on balance, we do not agree that FOS has satisfied the “high bar” referred to by the CA for establishing that the Request is vexatious. This does not mean, of course, that any future request(s) made by the Appellant to FOS will not properly be characterised as vexatious. The finding we make is on the evidence before us, and it may well be that if the issue arises in the future, the evidence will support a different finding. Sections 12 and 16 78. There can be no doubt that FOS was entirely correct in its view that to comply with the Appellant’s request, would well exceed the prescribed cost limit. Indeed, the Appellant does not dispute this. It is also well accepted that where section 12 is engaged, a public authority does not have to provide information up to the section 12 cost limits. 79. The only real issue in dispute, in relation to section 12, is whether under section 16, FOS should have engaged with the Appellant, and whether the Appellant would have been able to narrow the Request to what was realistically available within the cost limits. 80. The evidence shows that before refusing the Request, FOS did not engage with the Request or offer the Appellant the opportunity to narrow the Request, much less did they attempt to assist him to do so. This is not a case where the request for information was abusive or frivolous, nor indeed has FOS suggested that it was (notwithstanding its reliance on section 14), such that FOS could be excused for failing to do so. 81. We recognise that in its engagement with the Appellant at and after the hearing on 5 March, FOS went the extra mile, both in the amount of time it spent, as well as the extent of control that it gave to the Appellant, as to the scope of the searches, and that this was beyond what section 16 requires. Nevertheless, the exercise did demonstrate that there were possibilities that could have reasonably been explored. FOS could have offered, for example, to search a certain number of files. As to whether a public authority should be expected to undertake a sampling exercise, we do not say that it would be appropriate in all cases, but it may, in some cases, like this one, be a reasonable way for a public authority to discharge its obligations under section 16. 82. In short, we find that FOS failed to comply with its obligations under section 16. However, because of the steps that it has since taken on and after 5 March, we do not direct FOS to take any further steps in this regard. Other Points 83. FOS has made an application for costs on the basis that the Appellant has acted unreasonably in continuing with the appeal after FOS had complied with the agreement reached between the parties on 5 March. FOS relies on paragraph 10(1)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, which provides that if the Tribunal considers that a party has acted unreasonably in bringing, defending or conducting the proceedings, it may make an order in respect of costs. Sub - 16 -paragraphs (3) to (6) set out the procedures to be followed before the Tribunal makes such an order. 84. The Appellant’s reasons for continuing with the appeal and seeking a finding from the Tribunal are set out in paragraphs 46 and 47, above. In our view, the Appellant’s decision to continue with the appeal, though accepting that he could not ask for FOS to do anything further in relation to the Request (and indeed, Mr Samson made it clear that the Appellant was not asking the Tribunal to direct FOS to do anything further), does not mean that he has acted unreasonably. He was not obliged to withdraw the appeal and has given reasons for his decision to continue. 85. Finally, we wish to make it clear that while we have found that FOS did not comply with its obligations under section 16, no criticism attaches to Mr Davidson or those instructing him in connection with this appeal. We recognise that FOS, like many public authorities, will have different people involved at different stages. Whatever may have been the case prior to the hearing, we are grateful for the constructive approach taken by FOS in the course of the hearing of this appeal. Decision 86. This appeal is allowed in part. 87. Our decision is unanimous.

"701","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0187 Decided without a substantive hearing Before JUDGE DAVID THOMAS TRIBUNAL MEMBERS SUZANNE COSGRAVE AND JOHN RANDALL Between KENNETH RICKARD Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and CORNWALL COUNCIL Second Respondent OPEN DECISION AND REASONS NB Numbers in [square brackets] refer to the open bundle Introduction 1. This is the appeal by Mr Kenneth Rickard against the partial rejection by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 26 July 2017 of his complaint that Cornwall Council had wrongly refused to disclose certain information to him under regulation 5 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR). 1Procedural history 2. Mr Rickard lodged his appeal on 25 August 2017. The Council was later added as a party. 3. Mr Rickard initially opted for an oral hearing. This was due to be heard in Bodmin on 16 January 2018. However, he did not attend, informing the General Regulatory Chamber (GRC) when contacted that morning that he had not received notification of the hearing. It appears that he had changed his email address but had not informed the GRC. In addition, Mr Simon Mansell, a legal executive with the Council who had been handling the case on its behalf, was unable to attend for pressing personal reasons (it transpired that he had not intended formally to represent the Council at the hearing but rather to make himself available in case of questions from the Tribunal). In the circumstances, the Tribunal had little option but to adjourn. 4. Following that hearing, the Commissioner suggested to Mr Rickard that he consider opting for paper determination of the appeal. Mr Rickard acceded, as did the Council. The Tribunal has concerns about the Commissioner’s suggestion. As an unrepresented appellant, not well versed in legal proceedings, Mr Rickard may not have appreciated the advantages of an oral hearing, where one’s own evidence can be supplemented and clarified, an opponent’s evidence tested and evolving legal arguments responded to in a way which is not possible with paper determination. The Commissioner did not explain this to Mr Rickard. He may well have opted for paper determination simply as the less stressful course - he says his health has suffered as a result of pursuing the request. 5. The Tribunal nevertheless provisionally acceded to the parties’ wish, whilst making it clear that it reserved the right to require a hearing depending on the responses to the series of directions which proved necessary. In the event, it was satisfied that it could properly determine the appeal without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended). 1 Factual background 6. The case relates to an integrated waste management (IWM) contract which the Council entered into with SITA Cornwall Ltd (now known as Cornwall Energy Recovery Ltd) (SITA or the Contractor). 2 SITA is part of the Suez International Group and is a private company. The contract – often referred to as ‘the Project Agreement’ – was made under the private finance initiative (PFI) and procured 1 SI 2009 No 1976 2 https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/media/10354020/b-amended-and-restated-pa-1.pdf 2under the negotiated procedure of the Public Services Contract Regulations 1993, although it appears that SITA was the only remaining tenderer by the time its bid was accepted. 3 The plant is known as the Cornwall Energy Recovery Centre (CERC) and the main operation is based at St Dennis, Cornwall. It was originally made in 2006, set to last for 30 years. There then followed a long hiatus while SITA sought planning permission. The Council as local planning authority granted permission, but this was successfully challenged in the High Court. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision in 2012. 4 7. Because of the long delay, the parties decided to restate the contract. This involved revising certain parts, including by updating financial information. The parties entered into a Supplemental Agreement on 21 March 2013. 5 There are a number of schedules to both the Project Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement. Most have been made public but some have not. It is those schedules, and parts of the Supplemental Agreement itself, which form the basis of the present dispute. (References in this decision to the schedules to the Project Agreement are as revised). The Supplemental Agreement recites that the Contractor’s obligations under the Project Agreement ‘include the finance, design, construction, refurbishment and operation of new and existing facilities that are required for the receipt, handling, transportation, storage, recycling, compositing and disposal of the municipal waste of the County of Cornwall, including a proposed Residual Waste Treatment Plant [RWTM]’. 8. The CERC entered into operation in March 2017. Its target is to convert energy from the waste which it processes into enough electricity to power 21,000 homes each year. The revenue value of the contract to the contractor is around £1.1 billion and, in 2013, the net present value of cost to the Council was said to be £433 million. 9. Mr Rickard’s interest is as a local resident. In a submission made following the aborted January 2018 hearing, he says that he had been following the Council’s waste disposal plans since a 2002 public inquiry about the local waste plan. He also says that the incinerator is unpopular and has been controversial from the outset. The request 10. Mr Rickard’s request was preceded by an enquiry of the Council on 18 September 2016 [126] whether there were any parts of the contract with SITA which remined redacted. On 21 September 2016, the Council informed him that there were. It gave him the link to the redacted contract. On 25 September 2016 [127], Mr 3 SI 1993 No 3228 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/3228/contents/made 4 Cornwall Waste Forum St Dennis Branch v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2012] EWCA Civ 379 5 https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/environment-and-planning/recycling-rubbish-and-waste/waste- management/waste-contract/ 3Rickard requested ‘detailed copies of all the redacted parts of the Integrated Waste Management Contract’. He questioned the need for continuing redactions given that the original contract was signed many years previously. 11. Although Mr Rickard did not spell this out, the Tribunal accepts that what he wanted was the contract as revised in 2013. The initial response and review 12. On 25 October 2016, the Council gave its response [128]. It said that both the EIR and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) applied to the request. This was because there was a mixture of environmental and financial information (‘environmental information’ is defined by regulation 2 of the EIR: see below). To the extent that the information fell within the EIR, it relied on the exceptions in regulation 12(5)(c) and (f); 6 to the extent that it fell within FOIA, on section 43 (commercial interests). The Council noted that clause 101.2 of the Project Agreement designated certain information, listed in schedule 30, as commercially sensitive which should be kept confidential, although that was subject to any legal requirement for disclosure. 13. The Council also noted that ‘[t]he withheld information is mainly information pertaining to SITA’s pricing of the Project Agreement. Disclosure would adversely affect SITA’s position in the market when competing for other contracts. In addition the information could be exploited by third parties to the detriment of SITA and/or the Council’. 14. All these exceptions/exemptions are qualified, which means that, if they are engaged, the public authority still has to consider whether there is greater public interest in withholding the information or in disclosing it. The Council listed general factors pointing to disclosure (for example, enhancing scrutiny of its decisions and contributing to public debate on the issue). On the other side of the equation was the fact that disclosure would adversely affect SITA’s position in the market, and that the information could be exploited by (unspecified) third parties to the detriment of SITA and/or the Council. The balance of public interest lay, 6 ‘(5) … a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— … (c) intellectual property rights … (f) the interests of the person who provided the information where that person— (i) was not under, and could not have been put under, any legal obligation to supply it to that or any other public authority; (ii) did not supply it in circumstances such that that or any other public authority is entitled apart from these Regulations to disclose it; and (iii)has not consented to its disclosure’ 4the Council maintained, in withholding the redacted information at the time of the request. 15. Mr Rickard requested an internal review on 28 October 2016 [132]. He did not give any reasons. 16. The Council provided its review on 1 December 2016 [133]. The reviewer simply maintained that the public interest in withholding the redacted information outweighed that in disclosure. Proceedings before the Commissioner 17. Mr Rickard made a complaint to the Commissioner on 3 December 2016 [135]. He suggested that the contract had from inception been a mystery and had attracted much controversy over the very significant commitment of taxpayers’ money (which he put at some £800m) in the context of general public finances restraint and reduction in other services. 18. In its letter to the Commissioner on 14 June 2017 [143], the Council explained that it had had considerable dealings with Mr Rickard about CERC for over 10 years. He had made multiple EIR or FOIA requests, supplemented by formal complaints and general correspondence. He had made further requests since the present one. All this had represented a significant burden for the Council. As a result, it had informed Mr Rickard in May 2017 that any further requests would be deemed manifestly unreasonable within regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR. However, that has no bearing on the present request. 19. The Council did acknowledge that the CERC remained a matter of public interest, although the planning process had permitted representations, including from Mr Rickard. Information was routinely made public and the Council regularly engaged with the local community via the CERC Community Forum (the Forum), with minutes published online (although Mr Rickard was not a member and did not attend meetings). 20. The Council said it had released most of the contract. It was withholding commercially sensitive parts and personal information. However, it decided to release further information from clauses 50, 51 and 71 of, and schedule 1 to, the contract. This left: • Clause 5 of, and schedules 1 and 2 to, the Supplemental Agreement (outstanding claims between the parties: the Council relied on the exceptions in regulations 12(5)(e) of the EIR (harm to legitimate economic interests) and 13 (personal data) of the EIR, the latter in relation to schedule 1 • Schedule 6 to the Project Agreement (outstanding planning permissions and conditions) to the Project Agreement, Part I (extension of special areas of 5conservation) (apportionment of costs in certain scenarios, which had not occurred): regulation 12(5)(e) • Schedule 13 to the Project Agreement (planned maintenance) (nature and frequency of maintenance of facilities and equipment): regulation 12(5)(e) • Schedule 20 to the Project Agreement (employee information): regulation 13 • Schedule 23 to the Project Agreement (payment mechanism and excess cashflow sharing mechanism): regulation 12(5)(e) • Schedule 25 to the Project Agreement (financial model): regulation 12(5)(e) • Schedule 34 to the Project Agreement (RWTP Power and Heat Generation) (likely claw back of costs through the sale of waste management bi-products): regulation 12(5)(e) 21. The Council then set out in some detail why regulations 12(5)(e) and 13 were engaged and the public interest favoured withholding the remaining information. On reflection, it abandoned reliance on regulation 12(5)(c) and (f). It also attached a document entitled FOI/EIR Public Interest Test Proforma [158]. This document, which seems to have been prepared by the Contractor in October 2016, sets out standard form responses for FOI requests for those parts of the contract which had not been made public. 22. On 3 July 2017, Mr Rickard told the Commissioner that he did not want personal data. Regulation 13 of the EIR therefore falls away, and with it the dispute around schedule 1 to the Supplemental Agreement (that must remain withheld). The Commissioner’s decision notice 23. The Commissioner issued her decision notice on 26 July 2017. Drawing on the Tribunal’s decisions in Elmbridge Borough Council v Information Commissioner and Gladedale Group 7 and Worcester County Council v Information Commissioner and Mercia Waste Management Ltd (Mercia), 8 she decided that some parts of the contract the Council was still withholding should be disclosed to Mr Rickard and some withheld. The parts to be disclosed were schedule 6 part I and schedule 34 in its entirety. It is believed that the Council has subsequently disclosed that information. 24. The Tribunal will refer to the remaining information as ‘the disputed information’. It falls into these categories: (i) any potential claims which the Council and SITA had of each other in 2013 (Supplemental Agreement, clause 5 and schedule 2); (ii) planned maintenance (schedule 13 to the Project Agreement); (iii) payment 7 EA/2016/0106 8 EA/2015/0209 (10 April 2017) 6mechanism (schedule 23 to the Project Agreement); and (iv) financial model (schedule 25 to the Project Agreement). The Grounds of Appeal, the Responses and subsequent proceedings 25. In his Grounds of Appeal, Mr Rickard reiterated that he could not see the justification for confidentiality 11 years into the contract. Although not expressed as such, that was an argument that regulation 12(5)(e) was not engaged. He made some factual assertions which he said supported his case on public interest (some of them for the first time). These were: (i) councillors were pressurised into signing the original contract: (ii) the Council’s procurement procedures may not have been followed; (iii) the building of an access road and external connection to the National Grid unnecessarily cost the Council an additional £8m and £3m respectively; and (iv) a £25m loan granted by the Council to the Contractor in 2012 was granted without the approval of Councillors. 26. He attached extracts from the report dated November 2012 by Eunomia Research and Consulting (Eunomia) commissioned by the Forum. Eunomia was asked to consider the feasibility of an alternative plan for waste management in Cornwall. Mr Rickard summarised its conclusions as that the contract was outdated, not fit for purpose and offered poor value for money. A change of approach would save taxpayers nearly 50% of the present contract cost. 27. Mr Rickard argued that public interest favoured disclosure. He had a democratic right as a council taxpayer to know how his taxes were spent. 28. Later in the proceedings, Mr Rickard raised two further matters. First, he drew attention to serious damage to the roof of the incinerator in 2017 and attached correspondence between himself and Mr Paul Masters, the Council’s strategic director for neighbourhoods, in April 2018. Mr Masters explained that a review of the design had been carried out with a new installation planned. Mr Rickard concluded that there appeared to have been ‘serious failures in construction, management, material and design’, reinforcing the need for transparency. There had, he suggested, been non-compliance with the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. 29. Second, he disputed the Contractor’s claim that release of the disputed information would benefit its competitors. This was because of overcapacity in the sector. As of April 2018, Mr Rickard said, there were 44 incinerators in operation in the UK with another 16 under construction, a further 45 with planning permission and another 30 with permission pending. In total there were 135 incinerators subject to contracts. The EU Waste Management Directive, Mr Rickard continued, had set a recycling target of 50% by 2020 and DEFRA had indicated that the ‘circular economy’ 9 could be statutory by 2020. Mr Rickard 9 Described by one website in this way: ‘Looking beyond the current ""take, make and dispose” extractive industrial model, the circular economy is restorative and regenerative by design. Relying on 7attached a short extract from another Eunomia report, its Residual Waste Infrastructure Review Issue 12 (July 2017). Eunomia there posited two scenarios. Under scenario 1, its analysis suggested that the UK’s supply of capacity would exceed the available quantity of residual waste in 2020/21 (or in 2023/4 if the export of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) was excluded). Excess demand rose to 9.5 million tonnes in 2030/1 (5.9 million tonnes if RDF exports were excluded). Under scenario 2, capacity would again exceed residual waste in 2020/1, with the excess rising to 3.4 million tonnes in 2030/1. If exports were excluded, treatment capacity which was already committed broadly balanced the projected level of residual waste requiring treatment in 2030/1. The analysis effectively assumed that no further projects progressed beyond the planning stage. However, a number of facilities had already reached that stage. If new projects proceeded, the excess capacity relative to demand for treatment might occur earlier and/or ultimately reach a higher level. 30. In short, Mr Rickard’s argument was that there was no benefit to competitors in knowing the disputed information because no further plants of this sort would be commissioned, and competitors would therefore not be able to do anything with the information. In an earlier submission, made after the aborted January 2018 hearing, he also questioned whether the incinerator was still technologically relevant. 31. In that submission, he added that in 2017 Suez was fined £500,000 ‘for breaking the law while conducting Cornwall Council’s IWM contractual duties’ (but he did not elucidate or document); emissions had been a bone of contention since the outset and the Council had failed to conduct any ambient air quality monitoring or soil testing; he repeated his assertions that some Councillors had been distressed after agreeing the original contract (one immediately suffered a severe stroke from which she never fully recovered, he said) – none of the 84 Councillors had seen the contract before the meeting and only four ever saw it (and then only a small part); the £25 million loan to SITA was not approved by Councillors until some time after officers had already done so under delegated authority (many questions were raised about why an international group such as Suez needed a loan); procurement was not in accordance with EU rules in relation to the access road; and the Forum was poorly attended and something of a sham (he had never attended). 32. In her Response, the Commissioner summarised the background and the legal context. Given that the Council had now been joined as a respondent, she left it to it to comment on the adverse effects of disclosure on legitimate economic interests (including those of the Contractor). system-wide innovation, it aims to redefine products and services to design waste out, while minimising negative impacts. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural and social capital’: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy 833. The Commissioner raised one new matter, quite properly. She had identified certain information in schedules 13, 23 and 25 which might constitute ‘information on emissions’ for the purposes of regulation 12(9) of the EIR. The significance of this is that the regulation 12(5)(e) exception cannot apply to information falling within regulation 12(9). 34. In closed communications with the Council (shared with the Tribunal), the Commissioner subsequently identified information which might constitute information on emissions. In response, the Council explained why, in its view, none of it did and the Commissioner later accepted its explanations. For obvious reasons, Mr Rickard has not seen the exchange, save that the Commissioner’s letter to the Council of 20 November 2017 [124] in which she explains her general approach to regulation 12(9) is in the open bundle. 35. The Commissioner also summarised her position on public interest. She acknowledged that the large expenditure involved in the CERC provided a significant general weighting in favour of disclosure and that there was a public interest in information associated with it being available. However, she was not convinced that the disputed information would enhance the public interest in scrutinising the Council’s handling of the matter, bearing in mind that much of the contract was now available. It was, she suggested, for the Tribunal to form its own view on public interest in light of the Council’s Response and any oral evidence. The Council was best placed to comment on the factual allegations made by Mr Rickard in his Notice of Appeal. 36. In its Response, the Council addressed each of the items of disputed information: • Clause 5 of, and schedule 2 to, the Supplemental Agreement (outstanding claims prior to refinancing in 2013): disclosure would affect the Contractor’s commercial position as it would not be as competitive in future bids for public sector contracts. The Council would be detrimentally affected, too. The parties had agreed to the confidentiality of the information • Schedule 13 to the Project Agreement (planned maintenance): the schedule set out the nature and frequency of maintenance of facilities and equipment at the Municipal Recovery Facilities and the CERC and was industrial in nature. The type and frequency of planned maintenance was system-specific and constituted technical information not otherwise in the public domain. Disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of the Contractor’s commercial information if the detail of how it bid and therefore priced planned maintenance was disclosed to competitors • Schedule 23 to the Project Agreement (payment mechanism): the parts still withheld related to costs and profits and information relating to the Contractor’s pricing. Disclosure would adversely affect the Contractor’s commercial competitiveness as competitors could then see the basis on which 9it had entered, and therefore might in future, enter into commercial negotiations. The schedule included the price per tonne charge for the treatment of waste for all contract waste processed and per process (i.e. landfilled or processed by way of energy recovery). That would be of use to competitors competing for similar contracts. The schedule included 2012 prices for services which were market-tested • Schedule 25 to the Project Agreement (financial model): the schedule contained commercially confidential information about the costs and profits of the Contractor and information relating to pricing. Disclosure would adversely affect the Contractor’s competitiveness by offering a competitor crucial insight into the overall commercial bargain including payment terms for the construction of the CERC, details of funding arrangements and other detailed costs and profits 37. The Council made a number of other points. First, the Contractor entered into arrangements with third parity contractors throughout the term of the Project Agreement and it would be detrimental to its negotiating position were they to see the Contractor’s pricing and assumptions. Second, disclosure would also affect the Council’s business relationship as purchaser with third parties: suppliers might withhold sensitive information if they thought it might have to be disclosed. Third, the Project Agreement was still a fledgling contract with nearly 22 years to run and used a pricing structure which was still relatively new in the industry. Disclosure could therefore adversely impact on the Council’s ongoing relationship with the Contractor. Fourth, the Council gave a broad outline of its position on emissions. 38. The Council also addressed the public interest arguments raised by Mr Rickard in his Grounds of Appeal. It disputed, in effect, that Councillors had been pressurised into entering the contract into 2006 (but, in any event, it had been revised by Councillors in 2013); the procurement process under the procurement regulations had been followed; much of the financial information was only four years old (not 11 as Mr Rickard claimed); Councillors did approve a £25 million loan (at a meeting at which Mr Rickard attended and asked a question); the Council published all payments under the contract on its website which gave council taxpayers information about how their taxes were spent; and the Council and the Contractor was represented at the quarterly meetings of the Forum, which received updates from the St Dennis and Nanpean Community Trust administering the Community Fund to which the Contractor made payments based on the amount of electricity exported from the incinerator and to which the Council also contributed. It added that most of the contract had been disclosed. 39. Mr Stephen Daughtry, the Contractor’s representative under the contract since January 2016, gave a short witness statement on 27 November 2017 [260]. He pointed to the parts of the contract defined as ‘commercially sensitive information’ and suggested that the Council should be concerned to abide by the 10terms of the Supplemental Agreement. He dealt briefly with the categories of disputed information but did not add anything material to the Council’s Response. Discussion 40. The appeal raises a number of issues. Do the EIR apply as opposed to FOIA? 41. This does not appear to be a contentious issue. The Council now accepts that the disputed information is ‘environmental information’ and that the EIR rather than FOIA therefore apply (section 39 of FOIA provides an absolute exemption under that Act where information is environmental information). That is the Commissioner’s position, too, and Mr Rickard has not indicated dissent from it. 42. The Tribunal agrees that the disputed information is environmental information. The definition of ‘environmental information’ in regulation 2 of the EIR, though not limitless, is wide. In BEIS v Information Commissioner and Henney, 10 the Court of Appeal looked for a sufficient connection between the information requested and the environment. 43. There is clearly a sufficient connection in the present case, given that the subject- matter is a waste incinerator. As the Commissioner put it in her Response, the disputed information, which comprises a range of financial and technical information relating to the operation of the CERC, is information ‘on’ a measure that is likely to affect the state of elements of the environment within regulation 2(1)(a), such as air and atmosphere, land and landscape, either directly or through its effect on one or more of the factors set out in regulation 2(1)(b), such as energy and noise. Does any of the disputed information relate to ‘emissions’ within regulation 12(9) 44. The next question, logically, is whether regulation 12(9) applies to any of the disputed information because, if and to the extent that it does, the exception in regulation 12(5)(e) (the only one on which the Council relies now that Mr Rickard has confirmed that he does not want personal data) cannot apply. 45. Regulation 12(9) provides: ‘To the extent that the environmental information to be disclosed relates to information on emissions, a public authority shall not be entitled refuse to disclose that information under an exception referred to in paragraphs 5(d) to (g)’. 10 [2017] EWCA Civ 844 1146. As noted, on 20 November 2017 [124] the Commissioner wrote an open letter to the Council, attaching a closed table identifying, non-exhaustively, categories of information which she provisionally considered constituted information on emissions within regulation 12(9). She referred to her guidance on the provision 11 and explained her general approach. First, information on emissions could only concern outputs of a process or by-products, not inputs, and that such outputs or by-products must be uncontained or uncontrolled (for example, gas, steam, smoke or noise). Second, information on items going to landfill fell within regulation 12(9) to the extent that they are uncontained or uncontrolled. Third, assumptions and formulae used to calculate emissions constituted information on emissions (she briefly referred in this connection to financial information from schedules 23 and 25 identified in her table). 47. The guidance says that the Commissioner adopts the plain and natural meaning of the word ‘emissions’, as did the Tribunal in Ofcom v Information Commissioner and T-Mobile. 12 Applying definitions in The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 13 emissions will generally be the by-product of an activity or process, which is added (or potentially added) to and affecting the elements of the environment and over which any control is relinquished. However, a broad interpretation should be given, consistent with the purpose of Directive 2003/4/EC (the directive), which the EIR transpose into domestic law, and the Aarhus Convention, which underpins it, broader than that in Directive 2008/1/EC (the Integrated Pollution and Control Directive). 14 Information on localised or low-level emissions is still information on emissions, and can relate to emissions which have not yet taken place. 48. The leading case on regulation 12(9) is GW v IC and Local Government Ombudsman and Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council. 15 The requester had asked for a copy of Counsel’s Opinion obtained by a local authority about the ambit of its statutory nuisance powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The requester was concerned about emissions from a wood-burning stove used by his neighbours. One of the issues was whether the Opinion constituted ‘information on emissions’. If so, regulation 12(5)(d) (confidentiality of proceedings), on which the local authority relied, could not apply. 11https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1616/information-on-emissions-eir- guidance.pdf (2013) 12 EA/2006/0078 (September 2007) 13 ‘Emit’ – ‘1. Give off, send out from oneself or itself (something imponderable, as light, sound, scent, flames etc); discharge, exude (a fluid)’; ‘Emission’ – ‘1. Something emitted; an emanation. 2. The action or an act of emitting’. 14 ‘direct or indirect release of substances, vibrations, heat or noise from individual or diffuse sources in the installation into the air, water or land’ 15 [2014] UKUT 130 (AAC) GIA/4279/2012 (11 March 2014) http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2014/130.html 1249. Upper Tribunal Judge Turnbull noted that ‘emissions’ are listed as one of the ‘factors’ in the definition of ‘environmental information’ in regulation 2(b) of the EIR. There had, he said, to be a close connection between that reference and regulation 12(9). As a result, the latter did not cover anything beyond information relating to the nature, extent and so forth of emissions. That did not extend to legal advice about the width of statutory powers available to address emissions. 50. The judge referred to paragraph 14 in the Commissioner’s guidance: ‘Identical information can fall within several aspects of regulation 2(1). A lot of information is environmental because it is on a measure affecting, or likely to affect, the elements of the environment listed in regulation 2(1)(a) directly or via one of the factors mentioned in 2(1)(b). However, regulation 12(9) will only be relevant where information falls within the definition of environmental information directly under regulation 2(1)(b). In other words it will only apply where information is directly linked to emissions’. He said he agreed with the third sentence but not the fourth: the legal test was not whether there was a direct link between the information and emissions. The judge did not express disagreement with any other part of the guidance. 51. For obvious reasons, Mr Rickard has not seen the table and therefore has not been able to comment on whether the information identified by the Commissioner could indeed constitute information on emissions. 52. The table has four columns with these headings: the documents; the particular information which the Commissioner thought might constitute information on emissions; the questions she had about that information; and the Council’s comments. Having considered the Council’s comments, the Commissioner was satisfied that none of the information constituted information on emissions within regulation 12(9). So is the Tribunal. It cannot discuss the particular information in an open decision (and there is no need for a closed decision on this aspect given that it has never been part of Mr Rickard’s case that regulation 12(9) applies to the disputed information and that the Commissioner and the Council are now of one mind). The Tribunal can say, however, in general terms that the thrust of the Council’s case is that particular substances identified by the Commissioner are in fact contained and controlled; particular references are to process plant, not emissions, or are otherwise not related to emissions; other references are not to processes or outputs or by-products; and yet further references are to the release of funds or are otherwise financial in nature. The Tribunal accepts all this. The result is that the information does not fall within the term ‘emissions’ in regulation 2(b) and is therefore not ‘information on emissions’ within regulation 12(9). 53. Regulation 12(5)(e) is therefore in play. 13Can the Council rely on regulation 12(5)(e) EIR? 54. Regulation 12 reads: ‘(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9) a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if – (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. … (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect … (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest 55. The issues for consideration are therefore: (i) would disclosure of the disputed information (or part of it) adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information, where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest – in other words, is subparagraph (e) engaged in relation to some or all of the disputed information?; and (ii) if so, is there nevertheless a weightier public interest in the information being generally available, bearing in mind the injunction in regulation 12(2) that public authorities must apply a presumption in favour of disclosure? Is regulation 12(5)(e) engaged? Introduction 56. Under Article 4(2) of the directive, ‘The grounds for refusal mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 [replicated in the EIR] shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure’. That applies as much to regulation 12(5)(e) as to other exceptions. 57. That said, there is little doubt about the proper scope of that exception, though there may be some difficulty in applying it in practice. In Mercia, a case with striking similarities to the present one, the Tribunal cited (with evident approval) the four tests which the Commissioner had applied (as she has in the present case): (i) the information has to be commercial or industrial in nature; (ii) it has to be subject to a duty of confidence provided by law; (iii) the confidentiality has to be required to protect an economic interest; and (iv) that economic interest, and therefore its confidentiality, has to be adversely affected by disclosure of information. 1458. The first two criteria cover similar ground – it is inherently unlikely that information which is commercial or industrial in nature will not be subject to a duty of confidence provided by law. The disputed information meets these criteria. The information is found in a valuable commercial contract dealing with an industrial process. The law will prima facie protect such information, provided it reaches a threshold of seriousness. 16 Similarly, the third and fourth criteria really collapse into the single question whether disclosure would adversely affect a legitimate economic interest. It is not clear what function the adjective ‘legitimate’ has, but presumably it is to exclude from protection economic interests which are illegal or unlawful. Would the disputed information have been of value to competitors around the time of the request? 59. As noted above, late in the proceedings Mr Rickard made the argument that regulation 12(5)(e) could not be engaged because there was overcapacity in the sector, there was therefore no prospect of similar waste plants being commissioned and the Contractor therefore had no competitors for whom the disputed information would be valuable. 60. The Council responded briefly to Mr Rickard’s contention via email sent on 14 May 2018. It made two points. First, the fact that other plants might have been granted planning permission in the UK did not mean that contracts for construction/maintenance had been awarded in 2016 (when the request was made). It described as supposition Mr Rickard’s assertion that there was no prospect of new contracts for further plants. Second, revealing pricing information could limit the Contractor’s ability to get best value for money when negotiating with third party contractors. 61. The Tribunal accepts these arguments. The fact that a market may be contracting does not mean that there can be no new contracts. In any event, Suez is an international company and the fact that the UK market for this type of waste-to- energy plant is diminishing does not exclude opportunities outside the UK: the adverse effects required by regulation 12(5)(e) are not territorially limited. Although the burden of proof rests on a public authority relying on the exception to show that adverse effects to legitimate economic interests would (not simply might), on the balance of probabilities, be caused by disclosure, the Tribunal is entitled to infer that the market in question, though contracting, still presents opportunities absent clear evidence to the contrary. Mr Rickard has failed to provide such clear evidence. 62. In the Tribunal’s judgment, it cannot be said that, around the time of the request, there was no realistic prospect of similar plants being commissioned, such that the disputed information had no value for competitors. 16 In Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41, Megarry J said that ‘…equity ought not to be invoked to protect trivial tittle tattle, however confidential’. 1563. However, even if this is wrong, the fact that the Contractor’s economic interests would (as the Tribunal finds) be adversely affected by disclosure as far as its negotiating ability with its subcontractors is concerned – in other words, in the context of the present contract – is sufficient to engage the exception. With a contract as large as this one, it is inevitable that the contractor will need to engage a number of different subcontractors, at different times. If those subcontractors knew how relevant aspects of the main contract were priced, that would give them an unfair advantage in negotiating with the Contractor, who would be at a corresponding disadvantage. The Contractor’s legitimate economic interests would be adversely affected. The categories of disputed information 64. Apart from the overcapacity issue, Mr Rickard does not expressly argue that regulation 12(5)(e) is not engaged. Rather, he focuses on public interest. The Tribunal has nevertheless considered engagement. 65. By case management directions (CMD) issued on 16 April 2018, the Tribunal gave its provisional view on whether elements of the disputed information should be disclosed. The Council subsequently indicated that it accepted that view. The Commissioner has not commented. Mr Rickard continues to maintain that all the disputed information should be disclosed. i. Clause 5 of, and schedule 2 to, the supplemental agreement (outstanding claims prior to refinancing in 2013): 66. The Council has redacted the whole of this information. 67. By its CMD of 16 April 2018, the Tribunal gave its provisional view: i. Clause 5 of the supplemental agreement (claims outstanding between the parties to the agreement) should be disclosed: there is no warrant for maintaining that it engages regulation 12(5)(e) of the Environment Information Regulations 2004 ii. Schedule 1 (referred to in clause 5) contains personal data. Mr Rickard has confirmed that he does not wish to see personal data. The schedule should be withheld iii. Schedule 2 (also referred to in clause 5) should be disclosed, for these reasons: a. The Tribunal does not accept that disclosure would have an adverse effect on legitimate economic interests within regulation 12(5)(e). With a contract as large and complicated as the HWC, it is to be expected that there will be claims by one or other of the parties. The fact that a claim has been made does not mean that it is valid. 16b. In any event, it appears from the public interest pro forma answers in the open bundle ([158], [159]) that, under schedule 30 to the contract, schedule 2 was only to remain confidential until 21 March 2018 (the fifth anniversary of the contract restatement). That is recognition of the fact that claims will be withdrawn, settled or litigated to a conclusion and that any legitimate confidentiality which attaches to them will therefore dissipate over time. The Tribunal has to consider the application of regulation 12(5)(e) as at the date of the request (25 September 2016). Since any confidentiality will have been lost on 21 March 2018 at the latest, it follows that the Tribunal is in effect only considering the period 25 September 2016 to 21 March 2018. Bearing in mind that the claims will have been made prior to the contract restatement, the Tribunal considers that any adverse effect on legitimate economic interests through disclosure would have ceased to apply by the time of the request. The information would be of very little value to a competitor by this stage c. If that is wrong, the public interest in disclosure outweighs that of withholding the information. Particularly given the value of the contract and the controversy which has surrounded it, the public has an interest in knowing about disputes between the Council and [the Contractor]. 68. Clause 5.1 sets out the basic rule that the Supplemental Agreement and the amended and restated Project Agreement constitutes settlement and/or waiver of all claims by the parties as at the date of the Supplemental Agreement. Clauses 5.2 and 5.3 then say that the Council and the Contractor reserve the right to bring claims against the other in relation to any of the issues identified in schedule 2 along with those which could not reasonably be expected to be identified by each party as giving rise to a claim under the Project Agreement (following reasonable enquiries made of individuals listed in schedule 1 part B) in that Agreement’s form prior to the Supplemental Agreement. Clauses 5.6 and 5.7 provide that claims relating to matters which arose prior to the date of the Supplemental Agreement should be determined in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreement in its form prior to the Supplemental Agreement; and any claims relating to matters arising on or after the Supplemental Agreement should be determined in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreement as amended. 69. It will be seen that there is nothing confidential about the terms of clause 5 itself. It simply says that most extant claims are subsumed into the Supplemental Agreement but preserves some. Schedule 2 sets out the preserved claims. For the reasons set out in the 16 April 2018 CMD, in the Tribunal’s judgment this information is not confidential and is therefore not protecting a legitimate economic interest. Even if this is wrong, there is a supervening public interest in the information being available because the public is entitled to know what disputes the contract has generated and, therefore, what costs taxpayers might recoup or what further costs they might incur. 70. The Tribunal’s provisional view has become its concluded view. 17ii. Schedule 13 (planned maintenance) 71. Schedule 13 had been completely redacted. It deals with planned maintenance of the various parts of the CERC. 72. In its CMD of 16 April 2018, the Tribunal suggested provisionally: ‘Schedule 13 (maintenance planning) should be withheld to the extent that it contains information about when particular planned maintenance should take place and /or the replacement lifecycle of components but otherwise disclosed. The timescales could be valuable to a competitor as relevant to costings but the remaining information would not. The Tribunal also notes that there was a similar claim to withhold planned maintenance information in Worcester County Council v The Information Commissioner and Mercia Waste Management Ltd. 17 The contract at issue in that case was, of course, different but there appear to have been striking similarities with the present contract and indeed the Commissioner has placed heavy reliance on the decision of the (differently-constituted) Tribunal. In paragraph 53, the Tribunal noted that the generic parts of the ‘Outline Detailed Maintenance Plan’ had been disclosed (which has not happened in the present case). It decided that a ‘list of components making up the [Waste to Energy] Plant, with the nature and regularity of maintenance work being set out against each one’ should be withheld as potentially valuable for competitors or sub-contractors. Its approach broadly reflected that of the present Tribunal’. 73. The Council subsequently sent a marked-up version of the schedule reflecting its interpretation of the Tribunal’s approach. This left unredacted: the column headings Facility, Expected Maintenance and Time of Unavailability for the HWRC plant along with each geographical facility; the column headings Maintenance Required, Annual Maintenance – Time of Unavailability, Life Cycle Maintenance, Life Cycle Expected Years and Time of Unavailability of the RTS and DRTS along with the relevant facilities; the column headings Maintenance Required Bodmin MRF and Maintenance Contract Year for the Bodmin MRF, and the column headings Maintenance Required Pool MRF, Year(s) and Time of Unavailability for the Pool MRF, along with the items of equipment (such as bag splitters and conveyors); the heading Nature and Frequency of Maintenance per Nature and column subheadings Area, Component, Nature, Frequency of Maintenance and Expected Lifetime for the RWTP along with the items of equipment (and relevant parts of those items) and whether the maintenance was routine or lifecycle; and, also for the RWTP, the heading Number of days of unavailability per contract year of 12 months with the column subheadings Annual Maintenance (day) and each year from 2011 to 2036 and Routine interim outage, “Main” outage (incinerator lines) and Regular Maintenance. 17 EA/2015/0219 1874. All this would give the reader information, in general terms, about what is being maintained and where, but not how long the maintenance would take, when it would take place or how long the relevant operation would therefore be out of action. 75. The Tribunal considers that some further information of a general nature can be disclosed, as discussed in the short closed decision, without giving competitors useful information. However, it maintains its provisional view that information about the nature and regularity of maintenance work, and the time various parts of the CERC would as a result be out of action, engages regulation 12(5)(e) as potentially valuable for competitors or subcontractors and therefore adversely affecting the legitimate economic interests of the Contractor. iii. Schedule 23 (payment mechanism) 76. Most of schedule 23 is publicly available. Part A sets out the payment mechanism and part B the excess cashflow mechanism. 77. In its CMD of 16 April 2018, the Tribunal gave its provisional view: ‘The redacted parts of schedule 23 (payment mechanisms) should be withheld, save that it is now conceded that references to Goonvean may be disclosed. The information is potentially valuable to a competitor. Most of the information in the schedule has been disclosed’ 78. The reference to ‘Goonvean’ derives from schedule 34 (power and heat generation from the RWTM), which has now been disclosed. This explains that the Contractor has entered into a heads of agreement in July 2006 with Goonvean Ltd for the supply of heat to the latter. Goonvean Ltd is therefore a subcontractor of SITA. The published version of schedule 23 had redacted the prefix ‘Goonvean’ from terms such as ‘Adjustment’ ‘Heat Supply Agreement’ and ‘Incremental Costs’. Only the identity of the company had been redacted. The Council now concedes that the redaction is not warranted. 79. Still redacted is information such as the percentage of the payment per tonne in paragraphs 4.11 and 4.12; parts of the formula for calculating recycling deductions in paragraph 9.22; the penalty for customer dissatisfaction in paragraph 9.24; the business day facility delay deduction in paragraph 9.25; parts of the non-contract waste adjustment calculation in paragraph 12A.2; the calculations for the unitary charge index factor; a figure in Table 1A (price per tonne – base case) in Appendix 1; most of the figures in Table 1B (price per tonne); the figures for the contracted inactive waste tonnage for the years 2017 to 2037 in Table 2; the figures for the contracted BCW tonnages to landfill for those years in Table 3; the Contractor’s commission for specified waste items and the price per tonne for those items; and the percentage amounts which the Council and the Contractor are allowed to withdraw from the Excess Cashflow Account in specified circumstances (paragraphs 2.2 and 2.4 of part B). 1980. The Tribunal accepts that all this information is commercially sensitive and that disclosure would have an adverse effect on the legitimate economic interests of the Council and, more particularly, the Contractor. Mr Rickard has not sought to argue otherwise (except that he maintains that there are no competitors). Regulation 12(5)(e) is therefore engaged. iv. Schedule 25 (financial model) 81. The whole of schedule 25 has been withheld. 82. The schedule sets out in enormous detail the cost of the contract, by year and item. As the Tribunal said in the 16 April 2018 CMD, all the information is potentially valuable to a competitor. Mr Rickard has again not sought to argue otherwise (except that he maintains that there are no competitors). Regulation 12(5)(e) is therefore engaged. How should the public interest be applied to the information to which regulation 12(5)(e) applies? 83. The contract was entered into under the PFI. PFI contracts are controversial. They use private finance to build public projects. They have since 1992 been encouraged by Government as a way of securing finance for new schools, hospitals and other public projects. They are more expensive than direct financing. They are less popular than at one time, perhaps reflecting increasing concern about value for money: at the turn of the century, some 60 new projects were signed-off each year; in 2015, there were fewer than 10. 84. Some describe PFI contracts as mortgaging our future, even as economic theft, or see no place for private profit in public works as a matter of principle. Others see the private sector as a vital tool in releasing funds which would otherwise not be available for much-needed public projects and in injecting efficiency into large projects, justifying the extra cost. 85. These are philosophical and political questions and it is not for the Tribunal to resolve them. The fact is that, particularly at the time of the original CERC contract, it was government policy to encourage and facilitate PFIs, including for waste disposal. They are lawful and the EIR has to be applied on that basis. There is no suggestion that the directive or the Aarhus Convention contemplate that the private sector would not be involved in projects touching on the environment or therefore in generating environmental information. It is an inevitable consequence of that involvement that some information will normally have to be withheld from competitors and therefore the public: information is a key tool in private enterprise and there cannot be an information free-for-all if an enterprise is to flourish. As the Tribunal noted in London Borough of Southwark and The Information Commissioner 18 (in the context of regeneration of social housing): 18 EA/2013/0162 (9 May 2014) 20‘Once you use private sector profit making organisations to help fund regeneration and to deliver infrastructure, social housing and other public goods, then inevitably considerations of commercial confidentiality and the need to avoid harm to commercial interests must be given full weight when assessing the public interests for and against disclosure’. 19 86. The result, however, is that principles collide. On the one hand is this imperative for some confidentiality. On the other is the imperative for transparency and accountability in public affairs so that, in the present context, residents and council taxpayers can assess on an informed basis whether their political representatives are spending wisely the money given to them in trust and ensuring the best interests of residents. More generally, the first preamble to the directive recognises the importance of access to environmental information: ‘Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of view, most effective participation in environmental decision making and, eventually , to a better environment’. 87. Finding accommodation for these conflicting principles is no easy task. There is no empirically correct answer and reasonable people may arrive at different conclusions. That is why Commissioner decisions, and Tribunal decisions, may sometimes appear to conflict. The CERC contract is very expensive and appears to be particularly controversial, both in its original and restated manifestations, and Mr Rickard and his fellow taxpayers are concerned to uncover what they suspect to be poor decision-making, inappropriate or even corrupt behaviour and inadequate value for money. It is axiomatic that only with information can there be informed public debate and accountability. (The Tribunal should make it clear that it has seen no evidence of corrupt behaviour). 88. That said, because the EIR recognise that legitimate economic interests may trump transparency, and because there is no suggestion in the regulations or its EU and international forebears that the private sector should not be involved in public projects, the desire for maximum transparency is unlikely to morph into the total transparency Mr Rickard would like to see, short of compelling public interest arguments. That would be in practice to render impossible private sector involvement (whether via PFIs or otherwise) in public works touching on the environment. Something less than total transparency is not inconsistent with the presumption of disclosure in regulation 12(2) because a presumption can be rebutted and the EIR clearly contemplate that the presumption of transparency sometimes will be. 89. The benchmark, in the Tribunal’s view, is that as much information should be publicly available as possible, without (short of compelling reasons) imperilling the very commercial sensitivities on which PFIs are founded. That is why the 19 Para 51 21Tribunal has carefully scrutinised the disputed information and has ordered release of some further information. It should be acknowledged that the Council had already released considerable information unprompted by an EIR (or FOIA) request, then released further information to Mr Rickard following his request and has not challenged the Commissioner’s decision that further information should be released. The overall contract price is in the public domain and the Council periodically releases details of ongoing payments. 90. Mr Rickard has attempted to argue, in effect, that the circumstances surrounding the CERC contract are sufficiently compelling for everything to be disclosed. It is not to dismiss out of hand the legitimacy of at least some of his concerns to conclude (as the Tribunal does) that his arguments are not sufficiently compelling in public interest terms for the disclosure of the remaining information to which regulation 12(5)(e) applies. To recap: Mr Rickard argues that (i) councillors were pressurised into signing the original contract: (ii) the Council’s procurement procedures may not have been followed; (iii) the building of an access road and external connection to the National Grid unnecessarily cost the Council an additional £8m and £3m respectively; (iv) a £25m loan granted by the Council to the Contractor in 2012 was granted without the approval of Councillors; and (v) problems were experienced with the roof of the incinerator in 2017. 91. The difficulty Mr Rickard faces is twofold. First, he is not able to substantiate any but the last of these allegations. Second, even if he could they are not sufficient to override the legitimacy of the economic interests of the Council and the Contractor. The Tribunal stressed on more than one occasion that Mr Rickard needed to draw a causative link between allegation/public interest and particular parts of the disputed information. He has not done so. Even if councillors felt pressurised into signing the original contract in 2006, that has little relevance to whether information from the substantially restated contract in 2013 should be disclosed – there is no credible suggestion that the alleged pressure somehow vitiates the contract. Releasing the disputed information will not throw any light on whether procurement procedures were followed, or on the building of the access road and external connection to the National Grid or the £25m loan (and, even if there was information touching on these matters amongst the disputed information, the vast majority could have nothing to do with them). The problems with the roof were experienced in 2017, after the request. They could in principle, as Mr Rickard suggests, indicate design problems, perhaps originating in 2006. But even if that was so it would not, in the Tribunal’s judgment, justify releasing detailed, widespread financial information going to the core of the PFI contract. There is nothing directly relevant in schedule 13, either. 92. Mr Rickard relies on the Eunomia report in 2012. The report is critical of the contract and suggests it represents poor value for taxpayers. But, far from supporting his case for greater transparency, the fact that Eunomia was able to produce a detailed assessment without having access to withheld information indicates that there is sufficient information in the public domain for informed 22public debate. Eunomia had to make some assumptions it would not have had to make had it seen the full picture but that did not prevent it from arriving at reasoned, detailed and at times strident conclusions. Its report was on the original contract but there is no reason to think that it could not conduct a similar exercise on the restated contract. 93. For these reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the public interest favours withholding the remaining disputed information to which regulation 12(5)(e) applies. Conclusion 94. The appeal is allowed in part. Within the later of 28 days and the determination of any application by either the Commissioner or the Council for permission to appeal (and any subsequent appeal), the Council is to disclose (i) clause 5 of, and schedule 2 to, the Supplemental Agreement; schedule 13 in the form described in the closed decision; and an amended schedule 23 with the previously redacted references to Goonvean included. The Tribunal’s decision is unanimous. Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 7 August 2018 Promulgation Date: 9 August 2018 23"

Where s.37(1)(b) alone is engaged the Tribunal considers that on balance the public interest favours disclosure. The appeal is therefore allowed to this extent. The Ministry of Justice is required to respond anew to Mr. Loch’s enquiry, taking into account the Tribunal’s decision, within 28 days of the publication of this decision. This judgment stands as the substituted Decision Notice. -2-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1 Section 1 (1) of FOIA provides that: Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled: (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. 2 Section 37 (1) of FOIA provides that: Communications with Her Majesty, etc. and honours. (1) Information is exempt information if it relates to— (a)communications with the Sovereign, (aa)communications with the heir to, or the person who is for the time being second in line of succession to, the Throne, (ab)communications with a person who has subsequently acceded to the Throne or become heir to, or second in line to, the Throne, (ac)communications with other members of the Royal Family (other than communications which fall within any of paragraphs (a) to (ab) because they are made or received on behalf of a person falling within any of those paragraphs), and -3-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 (ad)communications with the Royal Household (other than communications which fall within any of paragraphs (a) to (ac) because they are made or received on behalf of a person falling within any of those paragraphs), or (b)the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity. 3 By reason of s.2 FOIA the exemption under s.37(1)(a) is an absolute exemption and if it is engaged then there are no other issues to be considered. Conversely, the exemption under s.37(1)(b) is a qualified exemption and if it is engaged then consideration must be given to the ‘public interest balancing test’, namely, whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information: S2(2)(b) FOIA. Request by the Appellant 4 The Tribunal were of the view (and no party disputed) that the Commissioner had correctly set out the background of this matter and the Tribunal therefore adopted that description. 5 On 10 December 2010, Her Majesty the Queen established courtesy titles of 'Lord' and 'Lady' for Justices of the Supreme Court. The Commissioner’s understanding was that the reason for this change was the appointment, in April 2010, of the first Justice of the Supreme Court who was not a life peer. This meant that not all Justices of the Supreme Court were addressed in the same way, and a concern arose that some litigants might consider that there was a hierarchy amongst the Justices. 6 On 22 January 2017, the Appellant wrote to the Ministry of Justice (""MoJ"") and requested information in the following terms (""the Request""): Please provide me with any correspondence, memorandums, or other materials documenting the decision to give Justices of the Supreme Court the courtesy title of 'Lord/Lady' in December 2010. I -4-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 would be particularly interested in any relevant correspondence between the Ministry of Justice and: 1. The Supreme Court or 2. The College of Arms. 7 The MoJ responded on 15 February 2017. It confirmed that it held information within scope of the Request, but withheld it in reliance on s.37(1)(b) FOIA (conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity). The MoJ’s response actually mistakenly referred to s.37(b) FOIA. 8 The MoJ maintained its position on 16 March 2017 following an internal review. Although it continued to rely on s.37(1)(b) FOIA it also referred in its second letter to the Appellant to the protection of 'communications with others in the Royal Household' (the interest protected by s.37(1)(ad) FOIA) 9 The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 17 March 2017. During the course of the Commissioner' s investigation, the MoJ relied in addition on s.37(1)(a) FOIA (communications with the Sovereign), and confirmed reliance on s.37(1)(ad) FOIA. The MoJ considered that each exemption applied to all of the information within the scope of the Request. 10 On 13 September 2017, the Commissioner served the Decision Notice (‘DN’). She accepted that s.37(1)(a) applied to all of the withheld information. As s.37(1)(a) confers an absolute exemption, the DN did not consider issues of the public interest, and did not go on to consider the application of the other exemptions on which MoJ had relied. The Appeal to the Tribunal 11 On 8 October 2017, the Appellant appealed. His initial Grounds of Appeal may be summarised as: -5-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 a) Ground 1: the Commissioner erred in taking a broad approach to the phrase 'relates to'. The exemption exists to preserve the political neutrality of the sovereign, whereas an overbroad approach would exempt information 'that is only remotely connected to The Queen's own views.' A narrow reading of an absolute exemption is also necessary to respect the presumption of disclosure created by s.1 FOIA. b) Ground 2: some of the information was unlikely to fall within s.37(1)(a), in particular as the impetus for the change came from the Supreme Court, so that a portion of the information probably pre-dated the involvement of the Palace. c) Ground 3: the Commissioner's approach was inconsistent with previous Decision Notices and with the voluntary release of similar material by the Government. 12 In his initial Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant invited the Tribunal to consider s.37(1)(b) should it accept that s.37(1)(a) was not engaged. He further submitted that the public interest balancing test favoured disclosure. The Questions for the Tribunal 13 Between the submission of the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal and the final hearing of this matter the parties had refined their arguments and submissions in relation to the issues in this case. The Commissioner was consistent throughout in maintaining her position that the exemption in s.37(1)(a) was engaged in relation to all of the disputed information and, it being an absolute exemption, that it was not necessary to consider any other issues. This was a position initially supported by the MoJ, but the public authority subsequently refined its position contending that s.37(1)(b) -6-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 was engaged in relation to all of the disputed information but that s.37(1)(a) was engaged in relation only to some of the disputed information. Where s.37(1)(b) alone was engaged then the MoJ contended that the public interest balancing test favoured maintaining the exemption. Mr Loch adopted a similar position to the MoJ in arguing that only some of the disputed information was covered by the s.37(1)(a) exemption but he contended that where s.37(1)(b) alone was engaged then the public interest balancing test favoured disclosure. No party sought, ultimately, to refer to any exemptions other than those contained in s.37(1)(a) and (b) and no party contended, ultimately, that s.37(1)(b) was engaged in relation to all of the disputed information. 14 The Tribunal consequently decided that the questions for them were: a) Having particular regard to the term ‘relates to’ in s.37(1) FOIA which, if any, of the disputed information was covered by s.37(1)(a) and s.37(1)(b) FOIA, and which was covered by s.37(1)(b) only? b) In relation to the information covered by s.37(1)(b) only did the public interest balancing test favour disclosure of the disputed information or maintaining of the exemption? Evidence & Submissions 15 The final hearing of this matter took place in London on 26 June. The Commissioner was represented by Mr Peter Lockley of counsel and the MoJ by Ms Catherine Callaghan QC. Mr Loch was not able to attend this hearing but helpfully agreed that it could proceed in his absence – with him relying on written submissions only. The Tribunal are very grateful to all the parties for the standard and quality of their written and oral submissions. Because of the high quality of the written submissions they are largely reproduced verbatim below as a way of setting out the various arguments that the Tribunal considered. However, this was a case where the parties -7-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 presented multiple written (as well as oral) submissions, and the Tribunal has sought to focus on the core arguments as they relate to the questions set out above rather than to reproduce exhaustively every single contention made by the parties. Submissions on the correct interpretation of the phrase ‘relates to’ and the consequent ambit of s.37(1)(a) FOIA 16 The MoJ presented the following submissions: a) The phrase ""relates to"" appears in subsection (1) of section 37 (""Information is exempt information if it relates to -""). This is a stem provision which governs all of the sub- paragraphs in s.37(1). Therefore, the phrase ""relates to"" must have the same meaning in respect of each of the sub-paragraphs of s.37(1). It would also be expected to have the same meaning wherever it appears in the Act: see APPGER v IC & FCO [2015] UKUT 0377 (AAC); UCAS v IC & Lord Lucas [2014] UKUT 0557 (AAC). b) However, s.37(1)(a) and (b) must be intended to catch different types or classes of information. Section 37(1)(a) is intended to catch information relating to ""communications with the Sovereign"". Section 37(1)(b) is intended to catch information relating to ""the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity”. MoJ agrees with the Tribunal that s.37(1)(a) cannot be drawn so widely that any information relating to the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity would fall within s.37(1)(a), as that would deprive s.37(1)(b) of any purpose. MoJ also agrees that, given s.37(1)(a) is an absolute exemption and s.37(1)(b) is a qualified exemption, that suggests there should be information relating to the conferring by the Crown of honours and dignities, which is covered by (b) but not (a). -8-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 c) Some assistance can be derived from the recent Upper Tribunal. decision in Cabinet Office v IC and Morland [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC). That case concerned a request for minutes of a meeting of the Honours and Decorations Committee (""HDC"") at which the HDC decided not to recommend the introduction of a National Defence Medal. The Cabinet Office withheld the minutes, relying on s.37(1)(b) and s.35(1)(a) of FOIA. The Cabinet Office did not rely on s.37(1)(a). d) The core issue in that case was whether the s.37(1)(b) exemption was engaged in relation to the conferral of existing honours and dignities only, or also extended to the creation of a proposed new honour or dignity. That required the Upper Tribunal to consider the purpose of s.37 as a whole, the meaning and scope of the phrase ""relates to"", and the difference in scope between s.37(1)(b) and the other sub-paragraphs of s.37(1). The Upper Tribunal held that: 1) the phrase ""relates to"" carries a broad meaning, and means that there must be ""some connection"" with the information or that the information ""touches or stands in relation to"" the object of the statutory provision. 2) the purpose of s.37 itself is to protect the fundamental constitutional principle that communications between the Sovereign and her ministers are essentially confidential. Section 37(1)(a) specifically protects the actual communications with the Sovereign; s.37(1)(b) must be concerned with activities other than merely communications with the Sovereign. The logical purpose of s.37(1)(b) is to ensure candour and protect confidences in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and -9-Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 medals. Hence, s.37(1)(b) can apply even where consideration of a particular award or medal does not lead to any communication with the Sovereign. 3) A proposal to award a medal to a particular named individual would inevitably engage s.37(1)(b), but given that such information would in any event be covered by the absolute exemptions in s.40(1) and/ or s.41, that suggests s.37(1)(b) serves a wider purpose not limited to the circumstances of identifiable individuals, for example, a discussion about a proposal to create a new honour: 4) However, there are limits on the breadth of ""relates to"" and ""any"" in this context, so that information about the venue where the HDC meets could not be said to be information that ""relates to ... the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity"". e) Thus, the Upper Tribunal held in Morland that the exemption in s.37(1)(b) covers both discussions about potential future honours as well as currently extant honours, provided that there is a connection of the subject-matter to the Crown. f) This decision is binding on the First-tier Tribunal in this case, in so far as it relates to the meaning of the phrase ""relates to"" in s.37(1), and the meaning and scope of s.37(1)(b). Thus, any discussions about whether the Crown should confer a new honour or dignity, or whether an existing honour or dignity (namely, the courtesy title of 'Lord/Lady') should be conferred on a new category of persons (namely, Supreme Court Justices), will fall within the scope of the exemption in s.37(1)(b). The UT decision - 10 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 in Morland put beyond doubt that the s.37(1)(b) exemption is engaged in respect of all of the withheld material in this case (and the Appellant appears to accept that proposition in paragraph 40 of his final submissions). g) In relation to s.37(1)(a), the UT in Morland correctly observed, in obiter dicta, that the exemption specifically protects actual communications with the Sovereign. But the exemption plainly is wider than that, because of the use of the phrase ""relates to"" in s.37(1). h) MoJ observes that ""relates to"" is an ordinary English phrase and that a ""steer or guidance in general terms"", beyond the point that it is used in a wide sense, ""is impermissible and unhelpful"": see APPGER. It follows that an exhaustive list of information falling within s.37(1)(a) cannot be given. With that caveat, MoJ submits that the following categories of information relating to the conferral by the Crown of honours and dignities would also fall within the scope of s.37(1)(a): 1) Communications to or from the Sovereign (or a person acting on the Sovereign's behalf); 2) Information intended for communication to or from the Sovereign (or a person acting on her behalf), irrespective of whether the communications were sent or took place; 3) Information referring to, or derived from, actual or intended communications to or from the Sovereign (or a person acting on her behalf), - 11 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 subject to a remoteness test. For example, a reference in a document to communications with the Sovereign, or a Royal Will. i) This approach does not deprive s.37(1)(b) of meaning. Where, for example, material simply discusses a proposal to confer honours or dignities upon a certain class of person but that material is not communicated or shown to the Sovereign (or a person acting on her behalf), is not intended to be communicated or shown to the Sovereign (or a person acting on her behalf), and does not refer to or derive from such communications, it will fall within the scope of s.37(1)(b) but would not fall within the scope of s.37(1)(a). That explains why the Cabinet Office in Morland did not seek to rely on s.37(1)(a) to withhold the requested HDC minutes. This is also the answer to Mr. Loch's example of a Bill: see paragraph 6 of his Further Written Submissions of 19 June 2018 17 The Appellant presented the following submissions on the proper construction of ‘relates to’: a) Section 37 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is written very broadly. It reads: Information is exempt information if it relates to— (1) communications with the Sovereign, (2) the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity There is a key distinction between the two exemptions: while section 37(1)(a) is an absolute exemption, section 37(1)(b) is a qualified exemption b) The Respondents have consistently argued that the phrase ‘relates to’ in section 37(1)(a) should be interpreted broadly. For example, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has argued that - 12 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 section 37(1)(a) applies, not just to direct communications between The Queen and Government ministers, but also to “material that has been shown or will be shown to the Sovereign for approval, and information intended for communication to the Sovereign irrespective of whether the communication was ever sent or received” (paragraph 20 of the MoJ’s final submissions dated 19 March 2018). However, this approach violates the ‘golden rule’ of statutory interpretation. c) It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that, when a literal reading of an Act of Parliament would result in an absurdity, the courts should look for another meaning in order to avoid the absurdity. See, for example, Adler v George [1964] 2 QB 7 and Re Sigsworth [1935] Ch 89. d) The broad approach to section 37(1)(a) favoured by the Respondents would result in an absurdity since it would undermine other portions of the FOIA. Section 37(1)(b) allows for the release of honours-related material if it is in the public interest to do so. However, The Queen’s role as ‘fount of honour’ means that any honours-related material will likely be connected with a communication with Her Majesty in some manner. If the Respondents’ interpretation of section 37(1)(a) is correct, the qualified exemption in section 37(1)(b) would be meaningless since the absolute exemption in section 37(1)(a) would preclude the release of all honours-related material. This cannot have been Parliament’s intent. e) A broad interpretation of section 37(1)(a) would undermine other parts of the FOIA as well. Given the Queen’s role in the administration of government, there are many matters that will involve communication with Her Majesty at some point. Let us imagine that ministers debate a certain policy, which leads to the introduction of a Bill in Parliament. The Bill - 13 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 subsequently passes both Houses and is presented for Royal Assent. Under the Respondents’ interpretation of section 37(1)(a), any information about that Bill (including the underlying policy debates), would seem to be absolutely exempt from disclosure since it is connected with “information intended for communication to the Sovereign” (i.e., the Bill). But this would be an absurdity given the existence of a specific exemption for material relating to the formulation of government policy (section 35). f) When trying to decide how section 37(1)(a) should be interpreted, the Tribunal should consider the provision’s legislative history. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed in Pepper v Hart [1992] UKHL 3, “[i]n my judgment…reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity.” g) Unfortunately, the section 37(1)(a) exemption appears to have received little attention during the FOIA’s progress through Parliament beyond a few drafting amendments. However, when the section 37(1)(a) exemption was changed from a qualified exemption to an absolute exemption in 2010, the Government briefly addressed the underlying principle behind it. h) The change was accomplished by means of a Government amendment to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. Moving the amendment in the House of Commons, the then-Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, spoke of the need to “protect the political impartiality of the monarchy, the sovereign's right and duty to counsel, to encourage and to warn the Government.” He went on to say that this convention relied on “well established and respected conventions of confidentiality”. - 14 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 i) Mr. Straw’s emphasis on the Sovereign’s right to counsel, encourage, and warn the Government is telling. It suggests that Parliament was primarily concerned with preventing the disclosure of communications that might reveal the Sovereign’s personal views. It is unlikely that Parliament intended for wider discussions of policy within Government to fall under section 37(1)(a) since such matters are already covered by other provisions of the FOIA. j) Despite the Information Commissioner’s approach to section 37(1)(a) in this case, past ICO decision notices have followed a narrower interpretation of the exemption. The Tribunal has already seen the material that the Commissioner ordered the Cabinet Office to release in the Kerslake peerage case (pp. 38-42 of the Open Bundle). All of those documents are undoubtedly “information intended for communication to the Sovereign” (indeed, the documents on pp. 39-40 would have been submitted directly to The Queen), yet the Commissioner nevertheless ordered their release. Significantly, the Commissioner’s Decision Notice in the Kerslake case (pp. 58- 64 of the Open Bundle) focused almost exclusively on section 37(1)(b), with section 37(1)(a) only mentioned in passing. The fact that the Cabinet Office did not appeal against the Decision Notice suggests that they did not think the Commissioner’s approach was flawed. The Commissioner’s handling of the Kerslake peerage case is hard to reconcile with her present approach to section 37(1)(a), and it lends credence to the notion that section 37(1)(a) should be interpreted narrowly. k) I also note that the Government itself has adopted a narrower interpretation of section 37(1)(a) in the past. I have already discussed how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided me with a considerable amount of material relating - 15 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 to the decision to give the Commonwealth of Australia a copy of their Constitution. Those disclosures included material that would unquestionably fall under the Respondents’ interpretation of section 37(1)(a), including drafts of royal Letters Patent and several briefings that were submitted to the Palace (along with various Government departments) for informational purposes. There is no indication that the FCO felt that section 37(1)(a) was engaged by any of this material. Furthermore, its release was not some act of grace on the part of the FCO; it was a standard disclosure under the FOIA. l) In a similar vein, the Cabinet Office recently provided me with information about the decision to transfer the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey to Scotland in 1996. This was also a matter that involved communications with The Queen since the decision to transfer the Stone was formally made by Her Majesty, but the Cabinet Office only withheld a limited amount of material under section 37(1)(a). According to the ICO’s Senior Case Officer, Jonathan Slee, the section 37(1)(a) material included letters to The Queen via Her Private Secretary, as well as some incidental passages in other material that the Cabinet Office nevertheless released in redacted form. Mr. Slee noted that he believed that the section 37(1)(a) exemption was applied correctly in this case. m) The Cabinet Office has demonstrated an eminently sensible approach to section 37(1)(a). While the Cabinet Office’s decision is not legally binding, it provides a suitable paradigm for interpreting section 37(1)(a) since it neatly balances the need to protect Her Majesty’s constitutional position against the need to ensure transparency in government. n) Section 37(1)(a) has received little judicial scrutiny. The leading case appears to be the First-tier Tribunal’s decision in Robert Brown v The Information Commissioner and - 16 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 Attorney General (EA/2011/0002). While it is true that the Tribunal supported a broad interpretation of the section 37(1)(a) exemption, a closer analysis of Brown reveals that the Respondents’ reliance on it is problematic. o) Brown was decided before the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 changed the section 37(1)(a) exemption from a qualified exemption to an absolute exemption. This is significant because the Tribunal’s broad interpretation of the phrase ‘relates to’ in Brown was based on another First-tier Tribunal decision, namely Department for Education and Skills v The Information Commissioner and The Evening Standard (EA/2006/0006) (see paragraph 44 of Brown). DFES concerned section 35(1)(a), which is a qualified exemption. The nature of the exemption is important because the Tribunal held in DFES that a broad interpretation of the phrase ‘relates to’ was appropriate “mainly because this is a class of information enjoying a qualified, not an absolute exemption” (see paragraph 53 of DFES). In other words, a broad interpretation was justified for qualified exemptions because the public interest test would serve as a check against overbroad applications of the exemption. But that does not apply in this case. Section 37(1)(a) is now an absolute exemption, so the public interest test cannot act as a safeguard. Therefore, the Tribunal’s reasoning in Brown is no longer applicable. p) The Respondents have cited other cases in support of their argument that the phrase ‘relates to’ should be interpreted broadly, including the First-tier Tribunal’s decisions in The All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition v The Information Commissioner (EA/2011/0049) and the Upper Tribunal’s decisions in The University and Colleges Admission Services v The Information Commissioner and - 17 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 Lord Lucas [2014] UKUT 557 (AAC). But the logic of those cases is inapplicable here because it would result in the absurdities I highlighted earlier. q) The Upper Tribunal’s decision in The Cabinet Office v Information Commissioner and Morland [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC) does not help the Respondents establish a broad interpretation of section 37(1)(a), either. Although the withheld material involved information destined for communication to the Sovereign (e.g., the decisions of the Honours and Decorations Committee), neither the First-tier Tribunal nor the Upper Tribunal held that section 37(1)(a) applied to the material. Instead, both Tribunals treated it solely as a section 37(1)(b) matter. Although the Upper Tribunal endorsed a broad reading of the phrase ‘relates to’ in section 37(1)(b), it does not follow that the phrase should be given the same construction with section 37(1)(a) for the reasons I have already stated…… r) For the reasons I have set out above, I respectfully submit that the Tribunal should adopt a narrow interpretation of the term ‘relates to’ in section 37(1)(a). 18 The Commissioner’s initial submissions on the issue of the construction of ‘relates to’ were as follows: a) The words 'relates to ' are to be construed broadly as a matter of their ordinary English meaning. In R v Smith (1975] QB 531 at 542B, Lord Denning said: ‘The words 'relating to' are very wide. They are equivalent to 'connected with' or 'arising out of'. b) The phrase 'relates to 'appears in a number of FOIA exemptions Tribunals have consistently held that the - 18 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 phrase should be broadly interpreted. In APPGER v JC and FCO (EA/2011/0049), the Tribunal, considering s. 23 FOIA (information relating to security bodies), considered that: ‘Applying the ordinary meaning of the words 'relates to’ it is clearly only necessary to show some connection between the informat1on and a s.23 security body, or that it touches or stands, in some relation to such a body. Relates to does not mean 'refers to', the latter is a far narrower term.’ c) This passage was cited with approval in UCAS v IC and Lord Lucas (2014] UKUT d) It is plain from the authorities cited above … that the phrase 'relates to' should be given a broad meaning. Furthermore, its meaning must be consistently applied across the different exemptions in which it occurs; there is no warrant for reading the phrase broadly in one context and narrowly in another. e) This is so even though the phrase occurs in both qualified exemptions (such as s.35) and absolute exemptions (such as s.23 or s.37) Where Parliament has chosen to make an exemption absolute, this reflects Parliament's view of the importance of the interests which that exemption protects. It is not the role of those charged with interpreting FOIA to recalibrate the exemption by reading words narrowly where their ordinary meaning is broad. f) The exemption at issue in this appeal, s.37(1)(a), exists to protect the convention that the Sovereign is politically neutral. As this is a constitutional principle of the utmost - 19 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 importance, it is unsurprising that the exemption protecting it should be both strong (absolute) and broad: it is a class-based exemption for which no prejudice is required, and it is broadly drawn by use of the phrase 'relates to'. g) The Commissioner is fortified in her view that Parliament attaches great importance to the interests protected by s.37(1)(a) by the fact that it was recently changed from being from a qualified to an absolute exemption. h) The Commissioner accepts that s.37 (1)(a) should not be construed so broadly that it encompasses information that has only a very remote connection to communications with the Sovereign. However, this is not the same as excluding information from the scope of s.37{1)(a) if it has only a remote connection with the Queen's own views. as the Appellant suggests. The provision covers information relating to any communication with the Sovereign; it is not limited by reference to the content of those communications. Information relating to wholly banal or administrative communications with the Sovereign would be caught, in just the same way as information relating to communications in which the Sovereign expresses personal opinions. In the absence of a public interest test, it may well be that this sometimes results in the withholding of anodyne information, but in the Commissioner's submission, this is unquestionably the balance that Parliament has chosen to strike. i) Applying the true, broad meaning of 'relates to', the Commissioner submits that all of the withheld information relates to communications with the Sovereign. - 20 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 j) The conferring of courtesy titles is a matter within the remit of the Sovereign and the decision to confer the titles in question was executed by a Royal Warrant, a highly formalised communication from the Sovereign which itself refers to representations having been made to the Sovereign on the issue of the courtesy titles. Plainly, the final phase of the process of creating the courtesy titles is actually comprised of communications to and from the Sovereign: representations to the Monarch on the need for the titles, followed by the Royal Warrant itself. k) In this context, all of the prior negotiation between bodies such as the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice, and the College of Arms 'relates to' the envisaged end product of communications to and from the Sovereign. This is what those promoting the measure are seeking to achieve. Such information is 'connected with' the ultimate communications with the Sovereign (to use the one of the formulations in R v Smith); alternatively, it stands in a tangible relationship to those communications, because a communication from the Sovereign is the aim of those engaging in the correspondence that forms the withheld information. 19 The Commissioner presented the following final submissions: a) The Appellant argues that 'relates to' should not be construed broadly in the context of s.37(1)(a) FOIA, because it is an absolute exemption. The Commissioner draws the Tribunal's attention to the recent case of Cabinet Office v Information Commissioner and Morland (2018) UKUT 67 (AAC). In that case, the Upper Tribunal confirmed (at paragraph 18) that in the context of s.37(1)(b) FOIA, the phrase had a broad meaning. This - 21 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 case adds further to the weight of binding authority on the point, and in a context closely related to that in the present Appeal. b) It is true that s.37(1)(b) provides a qualified and s.37(1)(a) an absolute exemption, and the Appellant seeks to draw a distinction between the two. But this cannot be correct: a. The words 'relates to' occur in the overarching text of s.37(1) that governs both s.37(1)(a) and s.37(1)(b). They cannot mean one thing as they relate to one provision and something different as they relate to another; and b. There is in any event binding authority that 'relates to' should be construed broadly where it occurs in absolute exemptions, such as s.23 FOIA: UCAS v IC and Lord Lucas [2014] UKUT 0557 at paragraph 46, as cited in Morland at paragraph18. c) The exercise the Appellant advocates, namely that the information should 'carefully parsed to determine which portions might actually affect the Queen's political neutrality', is not an application of the statutory language, which is the exercise that determines whether the exemption is engaged. Rather, it is the public interest balancing exercise by the back door - but no such exercise falls to be performed for an absolute exemption such as s.37(1)(a). The Tribunal’s Decision on the term ‘relates to’ and the consequent engagement of s. 37(1)(a) and (b) - 22 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 19 The Tribunal carefully considered these submissions (and earlier submissions made by the parties) and made the following preliminary decisions: 20 The ‘guidance’ provided by the Upper Tribunal and other higher courts was not, in the Tribunal’s views particularly helpful. This is epitomised by the Upper Tribunal judgment in APPGER at para 25 – ‘ … apart from the steer given in earlier cases … to the effect that in s. 23(1) “relates to” is used in a wide sense we agree … that a steer or guidance in general terms is impermissible and unhelpful’. This Tribunal struggled to see how guidance from a higher court that could be applied by a lower one might be considered ‘unhelpful’. It is the lack of clear guidance that is more likely to be ‘unhelpful’. 21 Having said that, the one clear guiding principle from the higher courts which was binding upon the Tribunal is that the term ‘relates to’ is to be used in a wide sense, See, for example, UCAS v IC & the Lord Lucas at para 46 – ‘in the context of FOIA … ‘”relates to” has been accorded a similar broad construction, e.g. “some connection between the information” and the relevant body or that it “touches or stands in relation to such a body” (quoting APPGER). 22 Although the Tribunal accepted that this principle was binding upon them the Tribunal found the reasoning provided by the Upper Tribunal as to why “relates to” should be given a wide or broad construction hard to follow. The Tribunal also speculated whether the terms ‘wide’ and ‘narrow’ were particularly helpful in this context and whether a better approach might not be simply to say that the phrase should be given its ‘ordinary meaning’. Certainly, the attempts at providing a definition of the phrase referred to in the preceding paragraph appear simply to provide an ‘ordinary’ definition rather than a ‘broad construction’. However, the principle that the term “relates to” should be given a broad construction is binding upon this Tribunal and must be applied. If it is to be successfully challenged, then that would have to be before a higher court. - 23 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 23 The second point that the Tribunal embraced is that the phrase “relates to” should be given a similar construction within the same statute. It is important to consider this principle because the phrase appears many times in FOIA both in relation to absolute and qualified exemptions e.g. s.23 s.30 s.35 and of course s.37. It also appears in sections 4, 7 and 15 – sections that have no connection to exemptions. It is important to consider this principle as authorities considering the phrase may only be considering it in relation to a specific provision and, without making a decision on this principle, it would be unclear whether authorities on specific FOIA provisions containing the phrase ‘relates to’ had a wider application. Not only did this principle appear to be the correct approach in the opinion of the Tribunal but it would also appear to be the subject of binding authority – for example in the UCAS case the Upper Tribunal stated at para 46 – “it would be surprising if the same words were to be subject to a very different construction”. The Tribunal acknowledged that the term ‘a very different construction’ did appear to allow the application of slightly different constructions to different provisions but considered that the preferred course was to seek to give the phrase ‘relates to’ the same or a broadly similar construction throughout FOIA. 24 The Tribunal did consider that there was a certain attractiveness in Mr Loch’s submission that ‘relates to’ should be given a narrow construction in relation to an absolute exemption which did not have the additional consideration or, arguably, ‘safety net’ of the public interest balancing test to take into account. However, for the reasons given the preceding paragraph the Tribunal felt unable to adopt Mr Loch’s reasoning or his basic contention that “relates to” should be construed narrowly in relation to the s. 37(1)(a) exemption. The Tribunal also considered that in relation to this point Mr Loch relied too heavily in his submissions on the decisions of public authorities and the Commissioner (in Decision Notices) which were not in any way binding upon the Tribunal and conversely rather ‘glossed over’ the impact of those authorities that were binding on the Tribunal. - 24 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 25 Conversely, the third preliminary point or principle which the Tribunal decided was that the term “relates to” should not be given so wide a construction in relation to the s. 37(1)(a) exemption that it deprived the s.37(1)(b) exemption of all purpose. A very wide construction of ‘relates to’ in respect of information that ‘relates to’ ‘communications with the Sovereign’ ran the risk, in the Tribunal’s view, of encompassing entirely information that ‘relates to’ ‘the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity’ since the conferring of honours and dignities by the Crown is an activity with which the Sovereign is essentially involved. The Tribunal could not accept that it could ever have been the intention of the legislation to render a specific qualified exemption redundant by it being effectively entirely covered by another absolute exemption – although the Tribunal fully accepted that exemptions can and do overlap. It must therefore have been the intention of the legislation that subsection (b) should cover information that was not also covered by (a). This was an argument accepted unequivocally by the Appellant and the MoJ. 26 For this principal reason, the Tribunal could not accept the (particularly) broad construction of ‘relates to’ urged by the Commissioner since this did run the considerable risk of s.37(1)(b) thereby being made redundant. The Tribunal considered that the Commissioner struggled to provide clear examples of what type of information would be covered by s.37(1)(b) but not s.37(1)(a) if the Commissioner’s construction of ‘relates to’ was adopted - which brought into question the validity of the Commissioner’s particularly broad construction of the phrase. 27 The fourth preliminary point that the Tribunal decided was that it was appropriate to consider a ‘remoteness’ test in relation to what information was caught by the term ‘relates to’. This was the approach implicitly approved by the First Tier Tribunal in Brown v JC and Attorney General (EA/2011/0002). Arguably, this is the same point as made at paragraph 25 above but in a different guise. It would mean that the term ‘relates to’ would catch more than communications directly to and from the Sovereign (or, more likely, her private secretary) but should not catch communications - 25 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 where, although that might be some argument that there was a relationship or potential relationship with the Sovereign, that relationship was tenuous or tangential rather than real. 28 The fifth preliminary point that the Tribunal decided was that the approach to the term ‘relates to’ ought, in individual cases, to be based on comprehensible principles. This was effectively the approach argued by the MoJ (see Paragraph 16 h) above). The Tribunal considered that to contend otherwise risked shrouding the refusal to disclose information in mystery and obfuscation rather than clarity. The Tribunal acknowledged that this principled approach ran some risk of falling foul of that part of the judgment in APPGER which indicated that a steer or guidance in general terms is impermissible and unhelpful. However, the Tribunal considered that a principled approach was the more useful and preferable approach. The Tribunal also considered that the appropriate set of principles might well vary from case to case and would thus not be of general applicability or fall foul of APPGER. The Tribunal thus found the principles suggested by the MoJ at paragraph 16 h) to be useful although the Tribunal did not embrace them uncritically. For example, the MoJ proposed that the term ‘relates to’ would ‘catch’ Information intended for communication to or from the Sovereign (or a person acting on her behalf), irrespective of whether the communications were sent or took place. The Tribunal doubted, whilst not finding it necessary to make a final determination on the issue, whether, after a decision had been made not to send a particular communication to the sovereign, it would still, in all cases, be caught by the term ‘relates to’ in the context of the s.37(1)(a) exemption. As a further example the Tribunal also considered that an expression of willingness to communicate with the Sovereign was distinct from an intention to communicate with the Sovereign and that the former was unlikely to be ‘caught’ by s.37(1)(a). 29 The sixth preliminary point that the Tribunal decided was that a reference to the Sovereign, or communicating with the Sovereign, did not necessarily ‘fatally taint’ a communication in the sense of it irrevocably engaging the - 26 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 exemption in s.37(1)(a) and that if a document could be redacted so that that exemption was not engaged then that was a desirable approach to adopt. This was an approach supported by the MoJ but not, apparently, the Commissioner. It was not an approach that Mr. Loch was able to comment on as he had no access to the disputed information to allow him to suggest such redactions. 30 Finally, the Tribunal considered that the application of the six preliminary points set out above should result in consistent decision-making. The Tribunal found it necessary to make this point as it considered that the MoJ, in seeking to apply its proposed principles, did not appear to be making consistent decisions in relation to virtually identical communications. This resulted in the Tribunal finding that both more and less of the withheld information was covered by s.37(1)(b) alone – when compared to the submissions on this point from the MoJ. 31 The Tribunal then sought to apply the six preliminary points, plus the need for consistency, to the withheld information and in doing so concluded that the following communications within the closed bundle were covered by the exemption in s.37(1)(b) but not the exemption in s.37(1)(a): The document at p.29 The document at p.30 The document at p.31 The document at p.32 The document at p.33 – save that paragraph 1 and the last sentence of paragraph 4.

This flowed from the fact that the Commissioner considered that all of the disputed information was covered by s.37(1)(a) – the absolute exemption. 34 The Ministry of Justice presented the following submissions on the point: While it is acknowledged that there is a public interest in clarity and transparency concerning the criteria for conferring awards and reassurance that honours are conferred on merit, these factors are outweighed by the following matters: (1)There is a continuing need for a safe space in which to discuss the sufficiency of the honorific titles conferred on UK Supreme Court Justices, as to the relative standing of these honorific titles as they relate to other titles, and the ongoing confirming of honours to individuals. The issue of the Royal Warrants on 10 - 28 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 December 2010 has not concluded the matter. The witness statement of Charles McCall explains the extent to which the honours conferred on Supreme Court Justices remains a live issue. He explains that, as recently as December 2017, there has been discussion of the question whether Supreme Court Justices should be made life peers. (2)Second, disclosure of the information requested would adversely affect the principle of confidentiality, in respect of the views of individual judges, government ministers and the Sovereign on the conferral of courtesy titles and would be likely to lead to a chilling effect whereby the participants in the communications would be less willing to express their free and frank opinions in future. Disclosure of the requested information would reveal the personal views of the participants as to the advantages or disadvantages of different types of honour, in circumstances where those individuals would have had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality. (3)There is a particularly strong public interest in maintaining the independence of the judiciary. In fact, the Lord Chancellor and all other Ministers of the Crown with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary are under a statutory obligation to uphold the independence of the judiciary: see s.3 Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Some judges are named in the documents requested. Disclosure of the information therefore has the potential to affect or undermine judicial standing, integrity and therefore independence. 35 The Appellant responded as follows: The MoJ argues that the issue of Supreme Court Justices' courtesy titles is still a live issue. In support of this contention, they have introduced a - 29 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 witness statement by Charles McCall, who argues at para. 3 of his statement that: There are ongoing policy discussions within the Ministry of Justice and with other Government Departments including Cabinet Office, the Prime Minister's Office and The Palace concerning in respect of the Supreme Court both the effective operation of the honours system overall. and the conferment of such honours on individuals and classes of individuals. Mr. McCall also highlights the recommendation contained in the report of the Lord Speaker's Committee on the Size of the House whereby it was suggested that Supreme Court Justices might in future receive life peerages upon their appointment. Mr. McCall argues that this supports the MoJ's contention that the titles borne by Supreme Court Justice are still under active consideration, and therefore it is necessary to preserve a 'safe space' around the issue. However, as Mr. McCall himself admits in the final paragraph of his statement: Consideration of the honorific titles conferred on Supreme Court Justices is likely to be subject to the wider reforms of the House of Lords. Such reform ls not led by the Second Respondent and resolution of this issue is not anticipated to be resolved within the life of this Parliament (emphasis mine). ….. With Brexit looming, it is probably safe to say that the Government has more important things on its plate. This, coupled with Mr. McCall's admission that the matter is unlikely to be resolved during the present Parliament, suggests that any discussions within Government on the issue of Supreme Court Justices' titles are likely to be rather speculative at this point. ….it may be helpful to consider the application of the section 35(l)(a) exemption when evaluating the MoJ's safe-space arguments. In - 30 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 Department/or Education and Skills v The Information Commissioner and The Evening Standard (EA/2006/0006) ('DFES'), the Tribunal noted at para. 75(iv) that one of the underlying reasons for the section 35(1)(a) exemption was the need to avoid the risk of ""premature publicity"" (emphasis in original). But that is hardly the case here, as Supreme Court Justices have had courtesy titles since 2010, and any material from present-day discussions would fall outside the scope of my request. This passage from paras. 54-55 of the Commissioner's guidance on the section 35(l)(a) exemption seems particularly relevant to Mr. McCall' s claims: Not every decision or alteration made after an original policy was settled will amount to the development of that policy...By contrast, minor adjustments made in order to adapt to changing circumstances, avoid unintended consequences, or better achieve the original goals might more accurately be seen as decisions on implementation. Under that interpretation, any discussion about whether Supreme Court Justices should be given life peerages instead of the courtesy titles they currently enjoy would seem to fall into the category of policy implementation. The proposals highlighted by Mr. McCall would not represent a substantive change from the status quo. Whether the Justices hold their titles individually as life peers or hold them ex-officio by virtue of the current Royal Warrant, they will still be lords or ladies so the Government’s original decision to give the titles will remain unchanged for all practical purposes. ….. The MoJ maintains that the release of this information would have a chilling effect within government and discourage individuals from expressing their opinions freely and frankly. That is always a possibility when government information is disclosed, yet in passing the FOIA, - 31 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 Parliament has decided that the benefits of greater transparency outweigh the possibility of a chilling effect. The MoJ contends that the release of this information would undermine the independence of the judiciary … I would remind the Tribunal that some of the Justices' views on this matter have already entered the public domain. Furthermore, the issue could be addressed quite simply by redacting the names of individual Justices from the information. 36 The Appellant also put forward the following positive arguments in favour of disclosure: The decision to give Supreme Court Justices courtesy titles was an abrupt shift in policy. The Supreme Court came into existence on 1 October 2009, yet the Justices did not receive courtesy titles until 10 December 2010. There was plenty of time to address the issue before that point. Parliament spent over a year debating the legislation which established the Supreme Court … and over four years elapsed between Royal Assent and the Court's first sitting. …. This suggests that the lack of courtesy titles was ' a deliberate policy choice on the part of the then Labour government. The legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg seems to have come to the same conclusion. In a blog post published on 23 March 2010, he noted that he had been told ""long ago"" that future members of the Supreme Court would receive the courtesy title of ' lord/lady. But in a follow-up post on 16 April 2010, Mr. Rozenberg claimed that the then-Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, had effectively vetoed the Supreme Court Justices' courtesy titles. If this is true, it could explain why the titles were not conferred until after the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government took office in May 2010. But it would be enormously helpful if the public could see the decision-making process which led to the change. Did the Supreme Court Justices actually request courtesy titles? What advice did Ministers receive - 32 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 from civil servants? What role did the College of Arms play? Did anyone express reservations about this proposal? Did they consider any alternative titles? The fact that there are arguably several issues with the Justice's courtesy titles emphasizes the need for public scrutiny of the decision. Perhaps the most notable issue is the fact that, while the wives of male Justices receive the style of 'lady,' the husbands of female Justices and the same-sex spouses of Justices of either gender receive no such honour Whilst this approach is consistent with tradition, one could argue that it was inappropriate for the Government to adopt such a discriminatory approach when creating a new title in 2010. ….. Finally, it should be noted that there was no public consultation ahead of the decision to confer the titles, and the whole process took place through private discussions. Now, almost eight years later, it is time to reveal the process to the public. The Tribunal’s Decision on the Public Interest Balancing Test 37 The Tribunal did not consider, on balance, that there was a great deal of merit in the MoJ’s ‘safe space’ argument. It appeared to the Tribunal that the current policy in relation to the honorific titles conferred on UK Supreme Court Justices had been settled in 2010 and it was highly speculative for the MoJ to suggest that this policy needed to be and was being kept under constant review. Furthermore, the Appellant was seeking disclosure of information that led up to the settling of that policy in 2010 and was not seeking the disclosure of any information relating to any claimed ongoing review of that policy. 38 The Tribunal also considered that there was not a great deal of merit in the MoJ’s contention that the maintenance of the exemption was required to preserve judicial independence. Indeed, the Tribunal considered that the - 33 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 converse was true. Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the governance of a state is traditionally divided into three branches each with separate and independent powers and responsibilities: an executive, a legislature and a judiciary. The distribution of power in this way is intended to prevent any one branch or person from being supreme and to introduce ‘checks and balances’ through which one branch may limit another. According to a strict interpretation of the separation of powers, none of the three branches may exercise the power of the other, nor should any person be a member of more than one of the branches. The conferring of honours on the judiciary by the executive ran the risk of being seen as an attempt by the executive to influence members of the judiciary. One of the ways to avoid this possibility or indeed the inference of this possibility was to open the decision-making process, by which the executive decided to confer an honour on members of the judiciary, to public scrutiny. The Tribunal noted that the MoJ itself referred to the element of openness in relation to the policy of conferring a knighthood or damehood on all High Court judges. All such judges received this honour specifically, so it could not be claimed that the executive was seeking to influence any single High Court judge. 39 The Tribunal considered that there was greater merit in the MoJ’s argument in relation to the need to maintain confidentiality. However, the public interest balancing test is precisely that – a balancing test – and the Tribunal considered that, for the reasons set out above, the public interest in disclosure prevailed over the public interest in maintaining the exemption. The Tribunal also considered that the issue of confidentiality could, if necessary, be addressed through the appropriate redaction of communications. 40 The Tribunal thus concluded that the public interest balancing test, in relation to the exemption in s.37(1)(b) FOIA, favoured the disclosure of the communications listed at paragraph 31 above to the Appellant. The Tribunal accepts that redaction of these documents may also be required to comply with the personal data exemption in FOIA – particularly in relation to the names of junior civil servants in accordance with usual policy. - 34 -Appeal No.: EA/2017/0223 Signed: Angus Hamilton DJ(MC) Tribunal Judge Date: 6 August 2018 - 35 -"
"731","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0188 Decided without an oral hearing Paper hearing held on 30 January 2018 Before JUDGE CLAIRE TAYLOR MICHAEL JONES NIGEL WATSON Between BRIAN BLAKE Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and CORNWALL COUNCIL Second Respondent DECISION We allow the appeal in part for the reasons set out below. Steps to be taken are set out in paragraph 28 below. This decision is to be treated as a substituted decision notice. 1REASONS The Request 1. On 20 December 2016, the Appellant requested from Cornwall Council (‘the Council’) as a ‘public authority’ for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’): “Mr & Mrs [X] Further to my letter of 10th October 2016, the above named were assessed for care in October 2010 and I have asked for a copy of the assessment on many occasions but again I have NOT received a copy of this assessment which I am entitled to receive as I had to pay the bill for his care. I would also like to receive any other financial information appertaining to the above named, as it would appear to me that Mr [X] was paying more for his care than his income – this is surely not right. [...] I would therefore request that the information be forwarded to me at the earliest. “ 2. On 17 January 2017, the Council refused to provide the information relying on s.41(1) FOIA (information provided in confidence). (The Council’s internal review of the case of 7 February 2017 stated that the needs assessment that was carried out contained no financial information. This was an inaccuracy that has been made clear in response to our directions, during the course of this appeal.) 3. The Appellant progressed the matter leading to an investigation by the Information Commissioner (the ‘Commissioner’). The Commissioner’s Decision Notice (Ref.FS50668967) found that section 41(1) had been correctly applied so as to withhold the information. The Appellant now appeals the matter. The Task of the Tribunal 4. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by section 58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law and whether she should have exercised any discretion differently. The Tribunal is independent of the Commissioner and considers afresh the Appellant’s complaint. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. This is the extent of the Tribunal’s remit, such that our role in this case is limited to considering whether section 41(1) has been correctly relied upon and whether the Respondents properly addressed the full scope of the request. To the extent that the Appellant has raised issued that are beyond our remit, we do not address them below. 25. The parties elected or consented for the matter to be heard without an oral hearing. The panel convened and adjourned the hearing to issue directions of 19 February 2018 to join the Council as a party. The Tribunal then received a number of further responses, communications and applications for rulings. Further directions were then issued on 11, 18 and 25 June. We are now satisfied that we have sufficient before us to fairly determine the matter. Some of the directions and responses needed to be made on a closed basis as they contained reference to the requested material. However, a gist was provided to the Appellant. We have not found it necessary to issue any part of this decision on a closed basis. 6. We have been assisted by various submissions from the parties and a bundle of documents, including a closed bundle of requested information. Pursuant to further directions, we have received additional documents from the Council that also comprised part of the requested information, and this was added to the closed bundle. We have carefully considered all information before us even if not specifically referred to below. The Law 7. Under s.1(1) of FOIA, a person making an information request to a public authority is entitled to be informed in writing whether it holds the information and to have it communicated to him, unless it is exempt from disclosure under the Act. 8. Section 41 provides one such exemption. It states: ""(1) Information is exempt information if - (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person."" (Emphasis Added). 9. For our purposes, the elements of breach of confidence1 are that: a. The information was imparted in circumstances conferring an obligation of confidentiality; b. The information has the necessary quality of confidentiality; and c. Disclosure would cause a detriment to the person who imparted the information.2 1 As set out in Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 at 47. In the later House of Lords decision of Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers [1990] 1AC109, Lord Goff set out the broad principle in slightly different terms. He said: ""a duty of confidence arises when confidential information comes to the knowledge of a person (the confidant) in circumstances where he has notice, or is held to have agreed, that the information is confidential, with the effect that it would be just in all the circumstances that he should be precluded from disclosing the information to others."" 2 There is some dispute over whether detriment is a necessary element of the cause of action, and in any event the detriment of having the information disclosed against one’s wishes may satisfy any such requirement. 310. It is a defence to an action for breach of confidence that it was in the public interest to disclose the confidential information. Therefore, the Tribunal considers the weight of public interest in disclosure, applying a presumption that confidentiality should be maintained.3 11. As regards whether a duty of confidence can survive the death of the confider, we have been referred to the First-tier Tribunal decision of Pauline Bluck v the Information Commissioner and Epson and St Helier University NHS Trust (EA/2006/0090). In that case, the appellant made an FOIA request for her daughter’s medical records after she had died. She and the daughter’s husband were both personal representatives. The Tribunal decided that section 41(1) could continue to apply after death because an action for breach of confidence could still be taken by the personal representative of the deceased person. Again, the Appellant has not sought to dispute the reasoning in this case, and we find it persuasive. (It is noted that the Commissioner reasoned that the disclosure could constitute an actionable breach of confidence in this case even though at the time of the request, the Council was unable to determine whether or not the deceased person had a personal representative. In the Commissioner’s view, it was not necessary to establish whether the deceased person has a personal representative who would be able to take action. This is because it would not be reasonable that a public authority should lay itself open to legal action. This has not been disputed by the Appellant.) The Issues 12. One issue in this appeal concerns whether section 41(1) applies to the requested information contained in the Closed Bundle. To determine this, we must consider (a) whether the requested information was obtained by the public authority from any other person; and (b) if so, whether its disclosure to the public 4 would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person. 13. A second issue has arisen as a result of responses received to our directions after the hearing. This concerns the scope of the request. Evidence and Submissions Issue 1: Section 41 Commissioner’s case 14. In essence, the Commissioner’s case is that the Appellant has provided no reasons why her Decision Notice was wrongly decided and has not presented any new arguments beyond those already considered by the Commissioner. Her reasoning as to why section 41(1) applies includes: The requested information obtained from another person 3 See Derry City Council v Information Commissioner, IT, 8 January 2006 for a discussion of the application of the public interest test in this context. 4 It is noted that a disclosure under FOIA is deemed to be made to the world at large and not solely to the requester. 4a. The withheld information was obtained from another person. Whilst social care records relate to the care of a particular individual and are likely to take the form of assessments and notes created by professionals involved in providing the individual’s care, the information contained within such records derives from the individual under care. b. Having viewed the withheld information, it seems that in this case it was obtained from the deceased person, either directly or through professionals involved in providing their care, and other third parties. Disclosure would constitute an actionable breach of confidence c. Disclosure of the information to the public would constitute an actionable breach of confidence for the purposes of section 41(1)(b). This is considered by reference to the test in Coco v Clark: Quality of confidence d. The requested information has the ‘quality of confidence’: (A) It is more than trivial – comprising information of a sensitive nature, primarily medical, health, care details and financial information). These are personal, and important to the relevant individual. (B) There is no evidence to suggest the records are publicly accessible. Information conveyed created an obligation of confidence e. The information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. That obligation was created by virtue of the relationship between client and professional. A person in social care or under the care of professionals, would not expect information produced about their case would be disclosed to third parties without their consent. Detriment of confider f. Disclosure would be an unauthorised use of the information to the detriment of the confider. Even though the confider had passed away, a public disclosure of the information would infringe his privacy and dignity, which survived death. (See the Bluck decision above). It would also be an invasion of his right to privacy of his affairs under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998. No public interest defence g. Case law suggests that a breach of confidence would not be actionable in where a public authority can rely on a defence that the public interest in disclosure exceeds that in maintaining the confidence. h. The public interests in favour of non-disclosure are: i. A duty of confidence (particularly where owed to the confider) should not be overridden lightly. 5ii. Disclosure of any confidential information undermines the principle of confidentiality, which depends on a relationship of trust between the confider and the confidant. iii. People would be discouraged from confiding in public authorities if they did not have a degree of certainty that such confidences would be respected. iv. It is important that social care clients have confidence that sensitive information about them will not be made publicly available following their death. Otherwise, they may be discouraged from providing necessary information to those providing their care. This would ultimately undermine the quality of care that social services were able to provide; and may even lead to some people choosing not to engage with such services. This could endanger the health of social care clients and prejudice the effective functioning of social services. v. It is important to protect the confider’s privacy and dignity. The requested information is of a sensitive nature, - primarily medical or health or social care details and financial information- that was provided by or derived from third parties to the Council and ought not be disclosed to the world under FOIA. vi. There is a competing human right in Article 10 which provides for a right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to receive and impart information. i. The public interest in favour of non-disclosure is: i. So that the Appellant can administer the deceased’s estate as an executor. He claims to be liable for debts accrued by the deceased and wishes to understand the basis of these debts. ii. However, this is clearly a private rather than public interest. Whilst the Council’s refusal to disclose the information under the terms of the FOIA is likely to be frustrating to the Appellant, the Commissioner considers that disclosure under the terms of the FOIA is to the general public, and not the requestor in isolation. 15. The Appellant’s submissions and evidence includes: a. Mr [X] passed away in 2011. He and his wife are executors to the will. He requires the financial information held by the Council in order to obtain probate. b. The Council have dealt with someone else who is not a blood relative but will not deal with him whether in his role as next of kin or as executor. c. The Council did an assessment of Mr and Mrs [X], but will not provide a copy what information as to how they were assessed. 6d. He questions the point of a will if the Council treats him like this. He is of the understanding that a will is a legal document and as an executor he has the right to access the affairs of the deceased and obtain the assets, in order to administer the will as instructed by the deceased. This has not happened and he has not been able to obtain probate or letters of administration because of the information being kept secret from him. The Council instructed him to get legal advice which was very costly but his solicitor was unable to assist. 16. The bundle of papers included a copy of the will. Our Findings 17. We find the Commissioner’s arguments more compelling than those of the Appellant’s and adopt those set out in paragraph 14 above in their entirety. 18. As regards para. 14(a), we note that in our directions, we probed the Respondent’s case, particularly in relation to whether the information could be said to have been from someone other than the Council. This was because much of the information was on forms produced by the Council, and presumably completed by someone on behalf of the Council. However, the substantive information within those forms is the information requested by the Appellant. We are clear from reviewing that information that this was obtained from the deceased person either directly or through professionals involved in providing care, and/or third parties. 19. As regards para. 14(d), we note that the requested information comprises financial information in addition to social care records. These too carry the ‘quality of confidence’. 20. As regards the weight of public interest set out in para.14(h) and (i), there is a public interest in the Appellant being able to progress with his role as executor. However, the requested information comprises records that are all of a most personal nature. It is important to understand that when considering a request for disclosure of information under FOIA, we consider it based on it being disclosed publicly, to the world at large, and material disclosed under FOIA can be made public. Disclosing the material that the Appellant has requested to the public at large, would in our view be most inappropriate and not in the public interest. It is not suited to disclosure under the Act, because we find that section 41(1) applies. Issue 2 21. The panel noticed that information related to Mrs [X] had not been provided in the Closed Bundle, and it is not clear that it was before the Commissioner during the investigation or considered in the Decision Notice. In response to directions, the Appellant confirmed that his request concerned both Mr and Mrs [X]. He explained that he understood that a joint assessment had been undertaken and that he needed both assessments to obtain the full information. 22. The Council stated on 26 June 2018: 7a. By letter to the Appellant of 27 June, that the assessment undertaken on 25 October 2010 related to Mr [X] only, and was not a joint assessment with Mrs [X]. b. The original request was processed as a request relating to the data of Mr & Mrs [X]. However, when the Appellant requested a review of the Council’s decision, no mention was made of Mrs [X] and the review was therefore processed just as a request for the information relating to Mrs [X]. This was not questioned by the Appellant at the time. 23. It also explained not all its records were held electronically. If now seeking the information concerning Mrs [X], there would need to be a manual search of files to consider if there was any information that fell within the scope of this request. 24. The Commissioner chose not to address this matter. Our Findings 25. We find that the Appellant’s request included a copy of the care assessment for Mrs [X] and any other financial information appertaining to her. Given its absence from the Closed Bundle, and in the absence of further submissions on the point, on balance, we find it likely that the material was also absent from the Commissioner’s investigation and not considered by her in the Decision Notice. We find she erred in not considering the matter. 26. The Council’s explanation as to why Mrs [X] was not considered is not fully supported by the papers before us. We see no indication from the Appellant’s request for internal review that he was limited the scope of his request. Accordingly, the internal review should have properly considered the full request. Conclusion 27. In summary, we find that the information concerning Mr [X] was properly withheld under section 41 FOIA. However, the Commissioner erred in not considering the request insofar as it concerned Mrs [X]. Steps To Be Taken 28. The Council has confirmed that a joint assessment was not undertaken. Having taken into account rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (‘the rules’), and our finding in relation to the request concerning Mr [X], the importance of proportionality and efficiency, we find that the following steps should be undertaken: Within five working of the date this decision is promulgated to the Appellant, the Council is required to contact to the Appellant to confirm whether he still seeks the information requested insofar as it concerns Mrs X. If he does, the Council is required to provide a full response under section 17 FOIA within fifteen working days of receipt of the Appellant’s response. 8Other Alternative Resolution 29. We note that this case relates to a matter that has been ongoing for a considerable length of time, and the Appellant seems to have tried hard to find a resolution. In our view, the material is not suited to a disclosure under FOIA, and we are surprised that the Council had not been able to assist in resolving this before it reached this court. 30. We asked in our directions to the Council whether there was an alternative means to resolve the issues. The Council explained the problems in its reply of 8 March 2018. Curiously, this was withheld from the Appellant, and we ordered this disclosed under further directions. Notwithstanding the explanation, we hope that the Council can find a way to help the Appellant to understand what is needed and exactly how he can take the necessary steps to get what is needed. We would anticipate that they may be able to put him in touch with the public body in the vicinity responsible for assisting in these matters. This might be the Principal Registry of the Family Division. Appellant’s Application 31. In his reply to directions, the Appellant asked for the Tribunal to seek for the Council to pay the costs of the solicitor he instructed that is referred to in the papers. This is not within the powers or remit of the Tribunal. He claimed that our directions stated that he had not needed a solicitor. This is a misreading of the directions. 32. The Appellant also requested to understand the Registrar’s direction that waived the requirement under rule 23. This requires a respondent to reply to a notice of appeal. After the Council was joined to the appeal, it became a respondent. The Registrar made clear in her directions that it was not necessary for the Council to provide a full response to the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal. This was because the Council had been joined in order to respond to the particular points raised in our directions of 19 February. It was therefore not considered necessary, efficient or proportionate to require the Council to make a broader response. The Tribunal has an overriding duty to ensure the case is conducted within a proportionate manner. (See rule 2 of the rules.) 33. In various letters, the Appellant made objections that the Respondents’ responses had been redacted or that they did not fully address the points raised in the judge’s directions. Between 19 February and 5 July there has been extensive correspondence, directions and responses in this case, beyond what is common in this jurisdiction. The judge has repeatedly explained why certain material needs to be kept closed. The judge is satisfied that adequate responses were received for the panel to be able to come to a decision in this case, and that she has scrutinised these responses to ensure that they were not kept ‘closed’ when it was not necessary. This has meant issuing directions a number of times to reach that position where the judge considered that the Respondents ought to have provided open responses and at an earlier point. The Appellant was given an opportunity to respond (and he did so) when receiving those parts of the responses the she ordered be disclosed to the Appellant where the Respondents had initially sought to keep these closed. 9Signed Date Promulgated: 12 July 2018 Judge Taylor Date: 9 July 2018 10"

The appeal is allowed in part. 2. Ms Nicola Curtis has appealed against the rejection by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 15 August 2017 of her complaint that the London Borough of Lambeth (the Council) had wrongly refused to disclose certain information to her under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (the EIR). 1 1 SI 2004 No 3391 13. Ms Curtis had formally opted for an oral hearing. However, she did not attend. When contacted by the clerk, she explained that there was family illness but said that she was content that the appeal be determined on the papers and had in fact thought it would be. The Commissioner had submitted a Response (drafted by Counsel) but had indicated that she did not propose attending. The Tribunal was satisfied that it could properly determine the issues in the absence of the parties within rule 36 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended). 2 Factual background 4. Ms Curtis is chair of Central Hill Residents’ Association in Lambeth. There have been plans to regenerate Central Hill (the estate), which houses 470 households, since 2012. 5. The purpose of the regeneration is to deliver additional new homes to address the housing crisis in Lambeth and replace homes of poor quality. New homes will be built on Council-owned land, including land it acquired. There are both leaseholders (who have exercised their right to buy their homes) and tenants on the estate. Compulsory acquisition of many of the leaseholders’ homes will be necessary. Secure tenants are guaranteed a new home on the redeveloped estate and leaseholders will have the opportunity to acquire new homes there. 6. The Council has been in the process of establishing a company (also known as a special purpose vehicle) to progress the regeneration and provision of housing in the borough. Its provisional name is ‘Homes for Lambeth’ or ‘HFL’. The Council would own all the shares but the company would be required to operate as an independent entity and to function on a commercial basis, at least breaking even. It could not simply deliver affordable housing. It would need to enter into commercial deals with other land owners, development partners and energy suppliers, negotiate planning agreements on a commercial basis with the Council as planning authority, raise funding from the City and enter into investment agreements. The request 7. On 5 September 2016, Ms Curtis requested of the Council (i) the financial viability reports for the estate and (ii) the unredacted draft feasibility report for the project at the estate (version 5 dated 6 July 2016) [49]. The initial response and review 8. The Council responded on 3 October 2016 [50]. It treated the request as made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). It disclosed the financial viability reports unredacted. They are not in the bundle. It also disclosed a redacted version of the draft feasibility report which, it said, was provided to the Resident 2 SI 2009 No 1976 2Engagement Panel (REP) on 30 August 2016. Some of the description of documents in the papers is confusing but the Council described the redacted part as ‘REP Appendix B2 Development Assumptions Redacted’; it appears to be an appendix to version 5 of the draft feasibility report by Airey Miller (AMP), the Council’s consultants, on 6 July 2016 (reference 14/124). The open part of the draft feasibility report is at [64] and the redacted appendix begins at [87]. AMP provides consultancy services in relation to building and quantity surveying disciplines, project and construction management including development viability and financial modelling. The Council explained that it was relying on the exemption in section 43(2) FOIA (commercial interests) to withhold the redactions (the originally disputed information). Section 43(2) is a conditional exemption; the Council decided that the public interest favoured withholding the disputed information. 9. Ms Curtis requested an internal review on 11 October 2016 [54]. She referred to the Tribunal’s decision in Clyne v The Information Commissioner and London Borough of Lambeth 3 and suggested that the originally disputed information should be released because it was not commercially sensitive ‘and [the Council] are not going out to tender’. 10. In its review decision dated 31 January 2017 [56], the Council changed its position. Although it did not spell this out, it must have decided that the disputed information constituted ‘environmental information’ within regulation 2 of the EIR. It said that the exception in regulation 12(4)(b) applied: ‘… a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that … (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable’. It argued that it would take days, if not weeks, to review the information to determine whether other exceptions applied. Proceedings before the Commissioner 11. Ms Curtis had in fact already lodged a complaint with the Commissioner on 23 December 2016 [62], since she had not received a review decision. She again referred to Clyne and attached a copy from the Council’s monthly newsletter, Lambeth Talk, for December 2016. An article quoted Councillor Jack Hopkins, Cabinet Member for Regeneration: ‘There’s been growing public concern that deals with developers are done behind closed doors and we need to make the process much more transparent, clear, and fair, to make sure the affordable housing Lambeth badly needs is built’. The article said that developers of all major sites in the borough who were not able to meet its 40% affordable housing target would be required to publish an unredacted viability assessment explaining why. 12. In his letter to the Council of 13 April 2017 [98], the Information Commissioner Office case officer suggested that the exception in regulation 12(4)(b) did not apply, given that the disputed information extended to relatively few pages. However, he also suggested that the exceptions in regulation 12(5)(e) or (f) might apply. 4 3 EA/2016/0012 (14 June 2016) 4 Regulation 12(5)(f), on which the Council has not sought to rely, reads: 313. In its reply of 24 May 2017 [105], the Council changed its position again, now relying on the exception in regulation 12(5)(e) instead of regulation 12(4)(b). It maintained that the public interest in withholding the disputed information outweighed that in disclosing it. It said that the Lambeth Talk article referred to planning applications by developers negotiating affordable housing provision, a very different scenario to regeneration of housing estates. It subsequently, by email sent on 5 July 2017 [113], clarified why it believed that the exception applied to specified redactions: those under the headings Rents & Operational Allowances; Decanting/disturbance costs and buy-outs; Energy; Residential build costs; and Development Finance and Investment Finance. The Commissioner’s decision 14. The Commissioner issued her Decision Notice on 15 August 2017 [1]. 15. The Commissioner set out the four tests which she considers must be met before regulation 12(5)(e) is engaged: (i) the information is commercial or industrial in nature; (ii) confidentiality is provided by law; (iii) the confidentiality is protecting a legitimate economic interest; and (iv) confidentiality would be adversely affected by disclosure (drawing on the Tribunal’s decision in Bristol City Council and Information Commissioner and Portland and Brunswick Squares Association, 5 she said that, if the first three tests are met, so necessarily must the fourth). In relation to the third test, it is necessary to show on the balance of probabilities that harm would (not might) be caused by disclosure. 16. The Commissioner decided that the tests were met in relation to some, but not all, of the originally disputed information: • Decanting/disturbance costs: the redactions were appropriate. The information in question was relatively detailed and the Council was in the process of actively negotiating with freeholders and leaseholders, such that disclosure would harm the Council’s negotiating position • Residential build costs: the redacted information appeared to be very limited when compared to the complex procurement process which would presumably ‘… a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— … (f) the interests of the person who provided the information where that person— (i) was not under, and could not have been put under, any legal obligation to supply it to that or any other public authority; (ii) did not supply it in circumstances such that that or any other public authority is entitled apart from these Regulations to disclose it; and (iii) has not consented to its disclosure’. 5 EA/2010/0012 (24 May 2010) 4have to take place to secure contractors to build the new development. As a result, disclosure would not harm the interests of HFL in the way claimed • Rents & operational allowances: the redactions were not justified by parity of reasoning with the residential build costs redactions • Energy: although the Council had suggested that HFL would only potentially be looking for an energy partner, the Commissioner accepted that disclosure of the redacted information would harm HFL’s interests: it would provide an energy company with direct insight into HFL’s position by indicating the timeframe of a contract along with its anticipated annual cost • Development and finance: the redactions were appropriate: disclosure would undermine the HFL’s ability to secure funding for the project on the best terms available given the insight disclosure would provide potential funding partners into the company’s negotiating position 17. The Commissioner applied the public interest test to the information she agreed should be withheld. She referred to the Tribunal’s decision in London Borough of Southwark and The Information Commissioner (Lend Lease). 6 The Tribunal had identified three factors which were of particular importance: (i) the project must not be allowed to fail or be put in jeopardy; (ii) the importance of public participation in decision-making; and (iii) the avoidance of harm to a party’s commercial interests. It will be seen that factors (i) and (iii) point to withholding information and factor (ii) to disclosing it. In relation to (i), the Commissioner was not persuaded by the Council’s argument that, if the disputed information was disclosed, private sector development partners might be reluctant to be involved with HFL. This underestimated the commercial value to private sector organisations of providing HFL with investment. 18. In relation to (ii), the Commissioner noted that the Council had disclosed much of the requested information along with a range of other information and had been engaged in consultations with the residents. Nevertheless, those consultations would be aided by further disclosure. The Commissioner acknowledged Ms Curtis’ concerns that the proposed regeneration would not meet affordability quotas, even though there was, as the Council argued, a distinction between a situation where a planning application was submitted to it by a developer negotiating affordable housing provision and the Council itself regenerating housing estates. 19. In relation to (iii), there was an inherent public interest in ensuring fairness of competition; organisations should be able to protect and sustain their negotiating positions. That interest gained additional and significant weight given that the commercial interests of a Council-owned company were at risk. 6 EA/2013/0162 (9 May 2014) 520. The public interest arguments were finely balanced but by a narrow margin the Commissioner concluded that they favoured withholding the remaining disputed information. She was persuaded ‘by the significant, and … ultimately compelling public interest, in protecting the commercial interests of HFL to deliver the regeneration of the Central Hill estate’. 21. The Council has not challenged the Commissioner’s decision in relation to the residential build costs and the rents & operational allowances sections and has presumably disclosed these to Ms Curtis. The Grounds of Appeal and the Commissioner’s Response 22. In her Grounds of Appeal [21], Ms Curtis did not directly challenge the Commissioner’s finding that regulation 12(5)(e) applied to the remaining disputed information. However, she made a number of points, principally relevant to public interest. She said that the Council had set up a group of companies under the name Lambeth Topco Ltd, which would work with other private companies to regenerate six housing estates in the borough. The new companies had been established with public money, specifically council tax revenue and the general rent fund. The public was already deeply concerned about the Council’s finances and its vast debt and how the money would be repaid. It is not clear whether Lambeth Topco Ltd is in addition to or instead of HFL. 23. Ms Curtis was sceptical about the Council’s claim that it was regenerating the estates to create more homes: according to information on its own website, the number of publicly owned homes would be vastly reduced and not meet its guidelines for affordability quotas which they imposed on private developers. The commercial interests of a publicly funded company were not more important than the public interest in transparency and accountability for the use of public funds, she suggested. To the extent that redactions were warranted, they should be as limited as possible. 24. Ms Curtis said that many of the redacted items of information were available with other Lambeth regeneration schemes (such as Cressingham Gardens) and some were available via the industry. She gave the following analysis (not all of which correspond to the categories of the remaining disputed information): home loss payments (these were statutory and should not be redacted); direct finance (taxpayers should see this information since this was a public subsidy); commercial uplift (the figures had been given for Cressingham Gardens); decant/assumed disturbance payments (these figures had been given for Cressingham Gardens and were therefore in the public domain); leaseholders buyouts (these were again available for Cressingham Gardens and valuations for all properties on each estate were available on a Council website); section 196 receipts (these could be found from other sources; the Council should be accountable to taxpayers for their use); and one-off payments or set payments for ground rents/per acre fees for land 6should be treated as basic contract terms (disclosure would not cause significant harm as they are known in the industry). 25. Ms Curtis conceded that the principle that the venture should not be allowed to fail (as it was being funded by public money) could be compelling but, in light of the fact that past ventures by the Council had cost much more than originally anticipated, it was of deep concern to borough residents that more of their hard- earned money would be needed to complete the estate regeneration scheme. Accountability was difficult without information. She attached some figures from the Cressingham Gardens project [23]-[35]. 26. The Commissioner’s Response [38] reduced Ms Curtis’ Grounds to two propositions (not entirely fairly): (i) some of the information was in the public domain and was not therefore commercially sensitive; and (ii) there was considerable public interest in the Council’s conduct of the development, in particular to ensure accountability on behalf of residents: that trumped the commercial interests of HFL. As to (i), the Council had assured the Commissioner that the remaining disputed information was not in the public domain and the Commissioner had no reason to doubt that. The fact that information was available in respect of other development schemes did not mean that similar information had been public in respect of the development in question. Similarly, the fact that such information had been disclosed in other cases did not necessarily indicate that disclosure of the remaining disputed information would not harm HFL’s or the Council’s commercial interests. Each case had to be considered on its own facts. The Commissioner was satisfied that, given the stage of development at the time of request, the remaining disputed information was commercially sensitive. The information could provide companies with whom HFL might seek to contract with insight into its position on a number of issues, which might then hinder HFL’s ability competitively to negotiate and conduct tender exercises for the development as it progressed. 27. The Commissioner maintained her position on public interest. The statutory framework 28. Under regulation 5 of the EIR, pubic authorities have a duty to make environmental information available on request. 29. Regulation 2(1) of the EIR provides: ‘”environmental information” has the same meaning as in Article 2(1) of the Directive [Council Directive 2003/4/EC], namely any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on— (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, 7biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; (b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements; … (e) cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used within the framework of the measures and activities referred to in (c) …’. 30. Regulation 12 contains exceptions to the duty to disclose. It provides: (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if— (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure … (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— … (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest …’. Discussion Introductory remarks 31. The regeneration of the estate is a public: private partnership. Such partnerships are often controversial. They have become more common following the withdrawal of relevant central government funding for local authorities. Some people nevertheless think that the profit motive should have no role in areas of local government responsibility such as the provision of social housing. Others see the private sector as a vital tool in releasing funds which would otherwise not be available and in injecting efficiency into large projects. 32. These are philosophical and political questions and it is not for the Tribunal to resolve them. The fact is that it is government policy to encourage and facilitate 8public: private partnerships. They are lawful and the EIR has to be applied on that basis. There is no suggestion that Directive 2003/4/EC (the directive) (which the EIR transpose into domestic law) or the Aarhus Convention 7 on which it is based contemplated that the private sector would not be involved in projects touching on the environment or therefore in generating environmental information. It is an inevitable consequence of that involvement that some information will have to be withheld from competitors and therefore the public: information is a key tool in private enterprise and there cannot be an information free-for-all if an enterprise is to flourish. As the Tribunal noted in Lend Lease: ‘Once you use private sector profit making organisations to help fund regeneration and to deliver infrastructure, social housing and other public goods, then inevitably considerations of commercial confidentiality and the need to avoid harm to commercial interests must be given full weight when assessing the public interests for and against disclosure’. 8 33. The result, however, is that principles collide. On the one hand is this imperative for some confidentiality. On the other is the imperative for transparency and accountability in public affairs so that, in the present context, residents and council taxpayers can assess on an informed basis whether their political representatives are spending wisely the money given to them in trust and ensuring the best interests of residents. It need hardly be said that homes and communities are of the first importance to citizens; they should not be required to leave their homes, even on a temporary basis, without demonstrably good reason. More generally, the first preamble to the directive recognises the importance of access to environmental information: ‘Increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of view, most effective participation in environmental decision making and, eventually , to a better environment’. 34. Finding accommodation for these conflicting principles is no easy task. There is no empirically correct answer and reasonable people may reasonably arrive at different conclusions. That is why Commissioner decisions, and Tribunal decisions, may sometimes appear to conflict. The Council has made its attempt at striking the right balance and has released a large amount of information, including from the draft feasibility study. The Tribunal’s task is to assess whether it has struck the balance appropriately. Error of law by the Commissioner 7 The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (1998): http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf 8 Para 51 935. The Commissioner has made an error which appears at first sight to be significant. She has largely based her reasoning, both on engagement of regulation 12(5)(e) and on public interest, on the harm which disclosure would cause HFL and, in particular, on the importance of not stymying (through the general availability of relevant information) its ability to negotiate with potential partners. The problem with this analysis is that HFL did not exist at the time of the request or the initial response. It is trite law that it is the situation in existence at the time of a request, or the time of the initial response at the latest, which governs whether requested information has to be disclosed. (It makes no difference here whether the relevant date is that of the request or response). Evidence which comes into existence only later can be relevant but only insofar as it casts light at the circumstances at the time in question. HFL may now have been incorporated – the Tribunal has no information about this – but it did not exist at that time. It is impossible to see how an entity which does not exist, and might never exist, can have legitimate economic interests (or any interests). 36. However, the error is not material, for this reason. Until and unless HFL, or another company, came into being, any legitimate economic interests it would accrue are retained by the Council. Those interests are the same whether the Council carries out the regeneration itself or through a subsidiary company. They represent the ability to secure the best deal for council taxpayers and residents of the estate. The Tribunal will therefore consider whether disclosure of the remaining disputed information would have an adverse effect on the Council’s legitimate economic interests and, if so, whether the public interest nevertheless requires disclosure of some or all of it (bearing in mind the presumption in favour of disclosure in regulation 12(2) of the EIR). Is the remaining disputed information ‘environmental information’? 37. This determines whether EIR, as opposed to FOIA, is the correct legislation under which to consider the request 38. The definition of ‘environmental information’ is extraordinarily wide. However, it is not limitless and the Tribunal shares the unease expressed by its counterpart in Lend Lease 9 that there is a tendency to assume, wrongly, that anything related to the planning process falls within the definition and therefore outside FOIA. 10 In BEIS v Information Commissioner and Henney, 11 where the precise issue was whether it could be said that a project assessment review of a particular subset of the Government’s Smart Meter Programme (SMP) was information ‘on’ a measure affecting the environment (the SMP), the Court of Appeal looked for a sufficient connection between the information requested and the environment. 9 Para 29 10 See 39 section FOIA 11 [2017] EWCA Civ 844 1039. In Lend Lease, the Tribunal said 12 that the project was so large that it was likely to affect the state of the landscape as an element of the environment. The activity or programme was therefore a measure which fell within subparagraph (c) of the definition of ‘environmental information’. The Central Hill project is smaller but the Tribunal nevertheless considers that the approach in Lend Lease equally applies. The draft feasibility assessment was an economic analysis used within the framework of that measure and activity. There is sufficient connection between the assessment, and therefore the remaining withheld information, and the environment. 40. In fact, Ms Curtis has not disputed that her request is properly dealt with under the EIR. Tribunal decisions on which the parties rely 41. Ms Curtis relies on Clyne and the Commissioner on Lend Lease. 42. In Clyne, where the public authority was again the Council, developers made an application to vary an earlier planning permission so as (inter alia) to increase the number of residential units and parking but decrease the amount of affordable housing. The Council’s planning policies contained a target of 40% affordable housing for larger development schemes not benefiting from public subsidy. Applicants proposing to develop below the 40% figures had to demonstrate that it was not economically viable to deliver more, and their assessment would be independently evaluated by external viability assessors. The Council appointed BNP Paribas (BNPP) for this purpose. The requester asked for BNPP’s viability study or alternatively any viability study submitted by the developers. He referred to the Tribunal’s decision in Royal Borough of Greenwich v Information Commissioner and Shane Brownie on behalf of Greenwich Peninsula Residents. 13 43. The Council disclosed some material but withheld considerably more than in the present case. The Tribunal, applying the same four tests applied by the Commissioner in the present case, accepted that regulation 12(5)(e) was engaged but held that the public interest favoured disclosure. It was important that the public could interrogate why the 40% affordability housing threshold was not being met and that required full data, including intended disposal values from the remainder of the scheme. The fact that there was no suggestion that the Council had made a bad deal did not detract from the importance of transparency, and nor did the fact that there had been a thorough consultative process as part of the planning process or the fact that BNPP had conducted an extensive and expert independent review of viability. Those affected were less likely to respond to a planning application. The public interest in maintaining confidentiality was significant but the arguments for disclosure were vastly superior. The Tribunal did not accept the ‘chilling effect’ argument, that developers would in future give information on a more generic basis: the fact was that the Council had to satisfy itself that a greater 12 Para 33 13 EA/2014/0122 11level of affordable housing would not be possible. Disclosure at the time of the request would not have imperilled the project or prejudiced the developer’s bargaining position. 44. In Lend Lease, the requester was a former councillor of the London Borough of Southwark (Southwark). He asked for the financial viability assessment submitted with the planning application by the developer wishing to redevelop a large housing estate as part of a regeneration scheme. Faced with the disappearance of central government subsidy for affordable homes, Southwark required developers to make provision in their plans for homes to be sold onto ‘social housing providers’ at a price low enough for them to be let out at cheaper rents. The council had a target of 35% of new housing to be affordable (half at a social rent and the other half shared ownership). If the 35% target could not be met for a development, the developer had to submit an ‘open book’ financial viability assessment. 45. The Tribunal adopted the following definition of ‘viability’ from a Government- commissioned report by Sir John Harman: 14 ‘An individual development can be said to be viable if, after taking account of all costs, including central and local government policy and regulatory costs and the cost and availability of development finance, the scheme provides a competitive return to the developer to ensure that development takes place and generates a land value sufficient to persuade the land owner to sell the land for the development proposed. If these conditions are not met, a scheme will not be delivered’. The present Tribunal gratefully adopts the same definition. 46. If the development proved more lucrative than expected, Lend Lease would share some of its profits with Southwark. The parties agreed to keep confidential discussions and negotiations, whilst recognising that confidentiality might have to give way to an obligation to disclose information under FOIA or the EIR. One of the appendices to the viability assessment was a financial model developed by Lend Lease for use as an analytical tool on large projects. The assessment would change over time. 47. The Tribunal noted that the anticipated compulsory purchase order inquiry and negotiations involving the requester’s home would proceed according to well- known principles irrespective of disclosure under the EIR; Southwark’s ownership of the land in question did not carry special weight; and any difficulty in interpreting the requested information had to be left out of account; in fact, residents had access to specialist advice. 48. The Tribunal accepted that regulation 12(5)(e) was engaged. Application of the public interest test led to different results for different categories of information. For example, the financial model in Appendix 22 was a trade secret (which would have 14 Viability Testing Local Plans report for the Local Housing Delivery Group (2012) 12been given special protection under section 43(1) FOIA) and should be protected. Information about projected sales to private purchasers, by contrast, should not be protected: purchasers would be much more likely to be influenced by the market rate at the time. Similarly with property destined for a social housing provider. 49. Having set out the principles, the Tribunal left it to the parties to discuss what information should be retained or disclosed, returning to the Tribunal only if necessary. 50. At least on superficial consideration, it is not easy to reconcile the two decisions. That may in part be because there were inevitably differences between the two projects, or in part because the (differently-constituted) Tribunals struck the balance between commercial confidentiality and the importance of transparency at junctures which were different (but nevertheless in each case reasonable). Consistency in public decision-making is important, particularly where the public authority is the same (as in the present case and Clyne). Ultimately, however, the task of the present Tribunal is to make its own assessment, based on all the circumstances. Is regulation 12(5)(e) engaged with respect to the remaining disputed information? 51. The Tribunal has concluded that it is for some parts of the remaining disputed information but not for another part. a) Decanting/disturbance costs 52. Decanting is the process under which residents are moved on a temporary or permanent basis while repairs or redevelopment take place. Disturbance costs are the reasonable expenses to which they are entitled as a result. There is some overlap with home loss payments. 53. Those payments are required by section 29 Land Compensation Act 1973 where (inter alia) an interest in land is compulsorily acquired by an authority or a resident is permanently excluded so that improvements or redevelopment can take place. Various conditions have to be fulfilled. The rules are complicated but, in essence, under a combination of section 30(1) and The Home Loss Payments (Prescribed Amounts) (England) Regulations 2016 (which were in force at the time of the request) 15 the amount of the home loss payment where someone is occupying the dwelling is 10% per cent of the market value of an interest in the dwelling, subject to a maximum of £58,000 and a minimum of £5,800. Dwellings include any garden, yard, outhouses and appurtenances belonging to or usually enjoyed with that dwelling. 54. The Council has disclosed much of this information in the draft feasibility study. It has redacted the figures under: (i) the subheadings Assumed Home loss payment and Assumed Disturbance payment under the heading Existing Council Rent Decant; (ii) the 15 SI 2016 No 789 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/789/regulation/2/made 13Existing Leaseholder/Freeholder Decant Disturbance heading; and (iii) the Total Cost and Avg [Average]/dwelling value subheadings under the heading Freeholder Buy Outs (but not the equivalent information for Leasehold Buy Outs). It has revealed the headings and subheadings such that the reader can see the nature of the redacted information. 55. Because home loss payments are based on market value, which is more art than science to determine, their assessment cannot be reduced to arithmetical calculation. There is therefore some commercial value to the Council in keeping secret the assumptions it is using. 56. That said, as the Tribunal noted in Lend Lease there are well-developed principles for the assessment of compensation on compulsory purchase. That does not remove the uncertainty in assessment but it does significantly constrain the Council’s negotiating hand (and that of residents). These days there is a wealth of information about the value of homes on the internet. In addition, the Council has disclosed the equivalent information for the Cressingham Gardens regeneration. The financial viability report for that project was prepared by AMP, the authors of the draft feasibility report for Central Hill. There is no obvious reason why decanting/disturbance information should be regarded as confidential for one ongoing project but not another in the same borough. 57. In the Tribunal’s judgment, regulation 12(5)(e) is not engaged with respect to this information. There would be no, or no more than minimal, adverse effect from disclosure. If that is wrong, the adverse effect from disclosure on the Council is outweighed by the public interest in disclosure (the importance of maximum transparency and accountability for a controversial and expensive project directly affecting residents’ lives). b) Energy costs 58. The Council has redacted figures under the subheadings Yield and Av.Rate (£/PA) under the heading Energy/FIT’s [Feed-In Tariffs]/RHI [Renewable Heat Incentive], while again revealing the heading and subheadings. The figures are all said to be for 25 years. 59. The Tribunal accepts that, were this information to be disclosed, there would be a significant adverse effect on the Council’s ability to negotiate with energy providers. It notes that it was withheld with Cressingham Gardens [33]. The public interest favours withholding it (see further below). c) Development and finance 60. The Council has redacted the figures for sub debt and senior debt funding and finance costs for both development and investment finance, with commercial uplift in each case. It has also redacted the average property price under Loan to value; 14section 106 [Town and Country Planning Act 1990] capital contribution; refurbishment leaseholder repayment; RTB [Right to Buy] receipts deployed for build; and Land payments - Ground Rent Payment On Occupation £Per Plot/PA. In each case, the headings and subheadings are again visible. 61. The Tribunal considers that disclosure of this information would seriously prejudice the Council’s ability to secure investment on the most advantageous rates for its taxpayers (including Central Hill residents). Very similar information was withheld with Cressingham Gardens [34]-[35]. The public interest favours withholding the information (see further below). Public interest 62. The Tribunal has carefully considered whether withheld information under Energy costs and Development and finance should be disclosed under the public interest test. One of the public interest criteria put forward by the Tribunal in Lend Lease, and adopted by the Commissioner in the present case, was that the project should not be allowed to fail. That is self-evidently correct: those opposed to a scheme as a matter of principle could otherwise achieve their ends simply by seeking disclosure. However, it does not follow that there would need to be such a dramatic result from disclosure before the public interest favoured withholding the information. It is enough, in the Tribunal’s judgment, that significant adverse effect would be caused to legitimate economic interests – here, of the Council, but in other cases of a subsidiary company or negotiating partners - and that, as a result, the financial viability of a project would be rendered less likely. That would be the position were the development and finance information to be disclosed. As far as energy costs are concerned, there is an important, and decisive, public interest in the Council being able to negotiate the best deals for its taxpayers. 63. For the reasons already discussed, it is important that residents and Lambeth council taxpayers more generally should have as much information as possible about regeneration projects such as that of Central Hill. The withheld information should be the irreducible minimum. The Council has disclosed a considerable amount of information, including from the draft feasibility report. The Tribunal considers that, with the exception of the decant/disturbance costs, it is withholding no more than the irreducible minimum. 64. Understandably, Ms Curtis and her colleagues would like to see everything. They could then, if they so wished, instruct experts on a fully informed basis and interrogate the Council’s plans for their homes and their community with maximum effectiveness. However, the Tribunal has to balance that desire with what it regards as the Council’s legitimate economic interests and the imperative – for the benefit of taxpayers and the borough’s residents more generally - that its negotiating hand is not unduly restricted. It is right to note that, as a result of the request, considerably more information has been disclosed and relatively little remains withheld. 1565. In relation to the Lambeth Talk article, the Tribunal is not persuaded of the distinction the Council seeks to draw between planning applications by developers and regeneration schemes (which will, of course, also necessitate a planning application). However, this is not enough to tip the balance in favour of full disclosure. Affordability targets are important and the public is entitled to know why they are not met, but even so some information about a regeneration project has to be withheld if legitimate economic interests are not to be unreasonably adversely affected. A short quote from a councillor cannot alter that reality. Similarly, the fact that, as Ms Curtis contends, past projects by the Council may have overrun their budgets points to the need for as much information being available as possible for rigorous scrutiny, but not everything. Conclusion 66. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed to the extent of the withheld decant/disturbance costs information but otherwise dismissed. The decision is unanimous. 67. The Council is to disclose the withheld decant/disturbance costs information to Ms Curtis within the later of 28 days and the determination of any application for permission to appeal by the Council (and the substantive appeal if permission is granted).

"821","Substantive Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0189 Decided without a hearing On 22 March 2018 Before Karen Booth JUDGE Mike Jones and John Randall TRIBUNAL MEMBERS Between MICHAEL O’CONNOR Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and THE CHARITY COMMISSION FOR ENGLAND AND WALES Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONS 1DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below, the First Respondent’s decision notice dated 22/8/2017 is not fully in accordance with the law. The Tribunal allows the appeal in part and substitutes the following decision notice: The withheld information was correctly withheld in reliance on section 31(1)(g) (read with section 31(2)(f)) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, other than in relation to the information comprising the names and job titles of the officers of the Second Respondent who were corresponding with the trustees of the charity concerned. That information was correctly withheld in reliance on section 40(2). The Second Respondent is not required to take any steps. REASONS Background 2. The Appellant was a member of a Society, with charitable status (“the Charity”) since the 1970s and was actively involved in its running since the early 2000s. In December 2014, some allegations of misconduct were made about one of the Charity’s committee members. According to the Appellant, he resigned from his roles within the Charity after the committee decided to take no action in respect of those allegations. The Appellant was subsequently expelled as a member of the Charity. 3. The Appellant wrote to the second Respondent (“the Commission”) in March 2015, raising a number of concerns about the running of the Charity. On 30/7/2015 the Commission advised the Appellant that the matters he had complained about were for the Charity’s membership to resolve and that they were outside the Commission’s remit. The Appellant disagreed. After further exchanges of correspondence, the Commission decided to treat the Appellant’s objections as a complaint to be dealt with under its formal complaints processes. On 15/9/2015 the Commission completed stage 1 of its review procedure and rejected the complaint. The decision was further reviewed under stage 2 of the Commission’s procedures and the Appellant was informed on 20/10/2015 that: (a) the Commission had contacted the Charity about two matters (a potential safeguarding issue and issues relating to the charity’s accounts and governance), was satisfied with the trustees’ response, and would be taking no further action; and (b) the Commission had determined that the Appellants’ other concerns were essentially internal matters relating to the management and administration of the charity and were matters for the trustees. 4. The Appellant continued to dispute the Commission’s decision. On 6/1/16, the Commission informed him that they had decided to write further to the trustees for the purposes of establishing how they were managing the reputational risks in relation to the safeguarding concerns raised by the Appellant. 25. In the meantime (October 2015), the Appellant pursued his complaint with the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. In a report dated 6/9/2016, the PHSO dismissed the complaint, concluding that “ …the Commission has dealt with the Appellant’s enquires in a reasonable manner, and in ways that accorded with both the law and the Commission’s policies and procedures …… The Commission has considered the information that [the Appellant] provided but has decided this does not warrant the use of its formal enforcement powers. That decision appears in line with the Commission’s published risk framework for taking regulatory action.” 6. The Appellant raised further concerns about the Charity with the Commission in December 2016. At that point, the Commission confirmed that they were satisfied with the response from the trustees of the Charity regarding the management of the reputational risk issue and had concluded that there was no regulatory role for the Commission in that regard. The request for information 7. On 23/12/2016 the Appellant sent a further email to the Commission in the following terms: “Can you explain to me why you told [the PHSO] that you would be writing to me with an explanation of all your decisions if you now say that you cannot do so? And can you tell me how the charity said they were going to ‘manage the reputational risks’ as that is clearly a matter of immense importance to the membership.” 8. The Commission treated the second question as a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). On 25/1/2017 the Commission refused the request in reliance on section 31(1)(g) of FOIA. They subsequently reviewed their decision but did not change it. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 9. In February 2017, the Appellant complained to the First Respondent (“the IC”) about the refusal to provide the requested information. During the IC’s investigation, the Commission reconsidered their position. On 13/7/2017 they provided the IC with four sets of documents: (a1) correspondence between the Commission and the Charity that fell within the scope of the request (comprising 10 redacted emails which were sent in the period 15/9/2015 to 21/1/2016 inclusive); (a2) the unredacted versions of those emails; (b) correspondence between the PHSO and the Commission, all of which they considered to be outside the scope of the FOIA request, other than the PHSO Report referred to above (which the Appellant had seen); and (c) an email dated 21/12/2016 from the Commission to the Appellant (which answered the first part of the FOIA request). On the same date, the Commission provided the Appellant with copies of the redacted emails and explained that the redacted information was being withheld in reliance on sections 40(1) and (2), 31 and 41. 310. In her decision notice dated 22/8/2017, the IC decided that the Commission had correctly applied section 31(1)(g) with subsection (2)(f) to the withheld information and was not required to take any steps. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal 11. On 30/8/2017, the Appellant exercised his right of appeal under section 57 of FOIA against the IC’s decision notice. On 6/9/2017, the Tribunal gave a direction adding the Commission as a Second Respondent under powers contained in rule 9 of its procedural rules (the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009). All three parties elected to have the decision made on the papers. After reading the bundle of evidence, we were satisfied that we could properly determine the issues without a hearing. The law 12. Our task is set out in section 58 of FOIA: 58 Determination of appeals (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. In practical terms, that meant that we had to (a) decide whether the IC had correctly determined the scope of the request for information and (b) consider the information that had been redacted from the 10 emails referred to above and decide whether the Commission was entitled to withhold that information in reliance on section 31(1)(g), read with 31(2)(f), (law enforcement) (or, to the extent that those provisions did not apply, in reliance on: one or more of the other section 31(2) purposes referred to by the Commission; section 40 (personal information); and/or section 41 (information provided in confidence)). The text of those sections is set out in full in the Annex to this decision. 4The evidence 13. The evidence before us consisted of: the paper evidence in the open hearing bundle; the additional open documents; and the unredacted copies of the ten emails referred to in paragraph 9 above. The appeal grounds 14. The Appellant’s appeal grounds are set out in the documents at pages 14 and 18-21 of the open hearing bundle (and elaborated on in his subsequent responses at pages 70 and 80-84 of that bundle and in his final submissions dated 29/1/2018). 15. The Appellant raised many points that were outside our remit or which were not material to the issues we had to decide. He also made a number of unsubstantiated allegations. He appeared to be challenging the IC’s interpretation of the scope of his request for information. He objected to the Commission “bundling together” their public interest test arguments to section 31 and section 41 of FOIA. However, we considered that the IC had resolved that issue by finding that section 31 applied to all of the withheld information, clarifying the public interest arguments relevant to that exemption and clearly setting out why she decided that the balance was in favour of withholding the information. 16. The Appellant objected to the Commission adding themselves as a Respondent without his agreement. That objection is misconceived, however, as rule 9(1) of the procedural rules referred to above permits the Tribunal to give a direction adding a party as a respondent and rule 9(3) permits any person who is not a party to apply to the Tribunal to be added as a party. The Appellant’s agreement is not required We also disregarded his objection to the Commission introducing further exemptions at the appeal stage, as it is now well established in case law that a public authority is entitled to raise a new ground of exemption at any stage. 17. The Appellant asked us to consider “…the wider implications and precedent of accepting and thus condoning the .. Commission’s hugely contentious claim that they must be allowed to evade the FOIA because they are wholly unable to operate “openly and accountably” and should thus be exempted from the provisions of the Act.” Our decision and the reasons for it 18. We were satisfied that the IC had correctly determined the scope of the request in relation to which the complaint was made by interpreting it as a request for information held by the Commission about how the Charity said they were going to manage the “reputational risks” referred to above. The wording of that part of the request was, in our view, clear and unambiguous. And in our judgement there was also only one objective reading of the first part of his request (“Can 5you explain to me why you told [the PHSO] that you would be writing to me with an explanation of all your decisions if you now say that you cannot do so?); that is, it was a request for an explanation and not a request for recorded information held by the Charity and that it had been answered in the Charity’s email of 21/12/2016. In his appeal grounds, the Appellant appeared to be suggesting that the Commission and the IC should have interpreted the request much more widely so as to include, for example, information about how the Commission had verified the information it had received from the Charity (see page 18 of the bundle). In his reply at page 80 of the bundle, he said: “In reality, my request was simply to see the internal and other Charity Commission documents and correspondence relating to my complaints against the … trustees so that I could ascertain whether or not those complaints had been fully understood and properly considered.”. We did not accept that that was a reasonable interpretation of the request. 19. We reviewed the withheld information. It consisted of the following information: (a) the questions being raised with the trustees in connection with the alleged safeguarding issue and the responses to those questions; (b) name, title and email address of the trustee with whom the Commission was corresponding; and (c) names and job titles of the Commission officers who were corresponding with that trustee. 20. As regards (a) and (b), we had little difficulty in finding that section 31(1)(g), read with 31(2)(f), was engaged, given that the protection of charities against misconduct/mismanagement is one of the Commission’s statutory functions We agreed that the disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice the exercise of those functions by impeding the voluntary and candid dialogue between the Commission, trustees and others. We reviewed the public interest test arguments in favour of/against disclosure. We agreed with the IC’s decision that the public interest in favour of disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the exemption. We attached particular weight to the strong public interest in not disclosing information which would be likely to impede the Commission’s ability to carry out its functions effectively. 21. We rejected the Appellant’s assertion that the Commission was claiming that they must be allowed to evade the FOIA because they are wholly unable to operate openly and accountably and should thus be exempted from the provisions of the Act. The Commission had not made any such claim. In the experience of the Tribunal, it is common practice for regulators whose attention has been drawn to alleged malpractice to use informal methods of investigation in the first instance. This is generally the most sensible, cost effective and proportionate way to proceed. It would be wholly disproportionate in our 6judgement to expect a regulator to launch a formal investigation (except in the most extreme cases) without first attempting to ascertain, by means of quick and informal enquiries, whether the allegations have any sound basis which might then necessitate a different approach. This is supported, in our judgement, by the quick and helpful responses that the Commission received from the trustees of the Charity. We considered that there is a very strong public interest in allowing a regulator the freedom to exercise its statutory functions in an appropriate and proportionate manner and that this tipped the scales in favour of withholding the information. 22. As regards (c), it was clear to us that the disclosure of that information could not prejudice the exercise by the Commission of its relevant functions, given that they had informed the Appellant that they had written to the trustees. However, the Commission had also claimed that section 40(2) (personal information) applied to that information and we agreed. That information is clearly “personal data” (within the meaning of the section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the DPA”)) to which section 40(2) of FOIA potentially applies. Such information is subject to an absolute exemption from disclosure under FOIA in specified circumstances, including where section 40(3)(a)(i) applies. In summary, we were satisfied that section 40(3)(a)(i) applies to the names and titles of the Commission officers who were corresponding with the Trustees because the information is clearly “data” to which section 40(3)(a) applies and its disclosure would contravene the first data protection principle (“Personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully and …..must not be processed unless: (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 [of the DPA] is also met”). The Schedule 2 condition that is of relevance here is in paragraph 6(1): “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by … the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject”. Notwithstanding that the key information that the Appellant is seeking (i.e. what the Commission asked the Trustees and how they responded) is exempt from disclosure under section 31, we were satisfied that the Appellant was pursuing a legitimate interest. The disclosure of the personal data relating to the relevant Commission officers is not, however, necessary in our judgement for the purposes of those interests and the Commission is entitled to withhold it in reliance on section 40(2). Other exemptions cited by the Commission in relation to (a) and (b) 23. As regards (a) and (b), the Commission had also cited the exemptions in section 40(1) (personal data relating to the Appellant) and section 40(2) (personal data, 7including some “sensitive personal data”, relating to other individuals) and section 41 (information provided in confidence). We agreed that the relevant parts of that withheld information could have been withheld in reliance on sections 40(1) and (2) and that section 41 was also potentially applicable. However, as the IC had concluded that all of that withheld information could properly be withheld in reliance on section 31 (and as we agreed with that conclusion) it was unnecessary for her to reach any conclusions about the application of section 40 or section 41 and the fact that she did not do so did not mean that her decision notice was not in accordance with the law. Inadvertent disclosure 24. We noted that on page 1 of the disclosed information (email dated 15/9/2015) the Commission had disclosed the name of the recipient and the name and job title of the sender (information which they redacted from the subsequent emails). We assumed that this was an oversight on the Commission’s part. It did not affect their ability to rely on the exemptions referred to above in relation to the other recipient/sender details that had been redacted. Conclusion 25. The withheld information was correctly withheld in reliance on section 31(1)(g) (read with section 31(2)(f)) of FOIA, other than in relation to the information comprising the names and job titles of the Commission officers who were corresponding with the trustees. That information was correctly withheld in reliance on section 40(2). The IC’s decision notice dated 22/8/2017 is not in accordance with the law insofar as it fails to refer to section 40(2) in that respect. However, the Commission is not required to take any steps.

"831","Substantive Refusal",": end | First-tier Tribunal | | (General Regulatory Chamber) - Information Rights | Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0232 Heard in London On 26 February 2018 Before | JUDGE DAVID THOMAS TRIBUNAL MEMBERS HENRY FITZHUGH AND PIETER DE WAAL Between _ LIAM O’HANLON Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER | | Respondent DECISION AND REASONS NB Numbers in [square brackets] refer to the open bundle Decision of the Tribunal | The Commissioner, within the latest of 28 days from the date of this decision or the final disposal of any application to appeal she makes, and any subsequent appeal, to the Upper Tribunal, is to disclose to Mr O’Hanlon: (i) the Summary of FTT Decision section of the FOI Policy Knowledgebase (pages 1-3 of the closed bundle); two internal |emails sent on 16 May 2016 (pp20-23 of the closed bundle); and (iii) paragraph 1 of an internal email sent on 17 May 2016 (p20 of the closed bundle). The remaining disputed information can be withheld. | Introduction | | 1. This is the appeal by Mr Liam O'Hanlon against the rejection by the Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) on 20 September 2017 of his complaint that she had wrongly refused to disclose certain information to him under section | 1(1)(b) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 2. Mr O’Hanlon opted for an oral hearing. A former practising solicitor, he represented himself. The Commissioner was represented by Zoe Gannon of Counsel, instructed by Claire Nicholson of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The Tribunal is grateful to Mr O’Hanlon and Ms Gannon for the helpfulness and conciseness of their submissions, particularly given that they thought that a day, rather than half a day, had been set aside for the hearing. It must be said that the conciseness with which Mr O’Hanlon expressed himselt orally stands in marked contrast to the prolixity of his written arguments: as an example only, his skeleton argument ran to 55 pages and it was soon followed by three witness statements totalling (including exhibits).a few hundred pages, in part because he wanted to ensure that the Tribunal had material which the ICO had declined to include in the open bundle. Much of this material, relating to previous appeals brought by Mr O’Hanlon, was at best of only tangential relevance. The Tribunal has nevertheless considered it. 3. The Tribunal will set out the factual background and the history of the present request before considering a jurisdictional question and the substantive merits of the appeal. 4. There was a closed bundle before the Tribunal and a closed session at the hearing, from which Mr O’Hanlon was of course excluded. The Tribunal gave him a gist of what had been discussed during the closed session. At Mr O’Hanlon’s urging, the Commissioner had provided him with an index of the closed material. The Tribunal is therefore able to refer to closed documents by title and date. There is no need for a closed decision. , 5. As the Tribunal will explain, the Commissioner is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA. The ICO is her office and performs most of her functions. It is not a separate entity in law. Nevertheless, for clarity the Tribunal will sometimes refer to the Commissioner and the ICO separately. | 2Principal relevant FOIA exemptions | 6. As the Tribunal will explain presently, Mr O’Hanlon has brought two previous appeals against the refusal of the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust (the Trust) to disclose information to him. In the second appeal (the 2015 appeal), the principal FOIA exemption in play was that contained in section 36(2)(b) (ii): ‘(2) Information to which this section applies is exempt information if, in the | reasonable opinion of a qualified person, disclosure of the information under this Act (b) would, or would be likely to, inhibit - (11) the free and frank exchange of views for the purposes of deliberation’ . | For the Trust the qualified person (QP), authorised by a minister pursuant to section 36(5)(0)(iii), was its then chief executive, Ms Maria Kane. 7. In the present appeal, the Commissioner relies on section 42(1) FOIA: | ‘Information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege or, in Scotland, to confidentiality of communications could be maintained in legal proceedings is exempt information’ . 8. Both sections 36(2)(b)(ii) and 42(1) are conditional exemptions, such that the public interest test in section 2(2)(b) must be applied if they are engaged. Factual background 9. The ultimate genesis of the request is an incident at a hospital run by the Trust. The essential chronology is as follows: e 25 May 2013: Mr O'Hanlon and a friend visited a terminally ill patient at the hospital. There was an altercation with nursing staff over their refusal to call a doctor. Mr O’Hanlon and his friend were asked to leave e 28 May 2013: Mr O'Hanlon made a complaint to the Trust, which rejected it. _ The Trust's report recorded that witnesses considered that Mr O’Hanlon and | his friend were aggressive and that the nurses had behaved appropriately | e 2 July 2013: Mr O'Hanlon made a second complaint, about the investigation | : into the first complaint. The second investigation reported on 25 October 2013 | and agreed that there were defects in the first investigation. It rejected Mr O’Hanlon’s substantive allegations but withdrew some of the allegations about his conduct and that of his friend |e Mr O'Hanlon subsequently made a complaint to the Parliamentary and - Health Services Ombudsman about the handling of his complaints by the - Trust. The Ombudsman rejected the complaint but disclosed some documents to Mr O’Hanlon on the basis that he could not himself disclose them e 31 October 2013: Mr O’Hanlon made a FOIA request of the Trust for the | relevant Datix Incident Review Form. The request eventually reached the Tribunal 1 because Mr O’Hanlon considered that he had been given the wrong | form. That contention was rejected but the appeal was allowed by consent | because during the appeal the Trust provided a version of the form with more | information - | : e 26 May 2014: Mr O'Hanlon made a second FOI request of the Trust, in 14 : parts. The Trust provided considerable information but withheld other | information, relying on the exemptions under sections 40(2) (third party | personal data) and 36(2)(b)(ii). The opinion for the latter exemption had been given, under delegated powers, by the Executive Director of Nursing, Quality and Governance (the Director of Nursing), Ms Saxton, in the absence on holiday of Ms Kane e 21 October 2014: Mr O’Hanlon complained to the Commissioner. e 30 April 2015: He (the Commissioner at the time was a man) agreed that | section 40(2) applied to information identifying individuals. He also held that the Director of Nursing was a “qualified person’ within section 36 and that her , opinion was reasonable. The public interest favoured withholding the information | e 26 May 2015: Mr O’Hanlon appealed to the Tribunal (the 2015 Tribunal). One of his grounds of appeal was that the Director of Nursing was not a QP, another related to the reasonableness of her opinion. He drew attention to guidance issued by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under section 45 FOIA (the MoJ guidance), which appeared at odds with the guidance issued by the Commissioner under section 47 FOIA (the Commissioner’s guidance). The MoJ guidance reads: | | | ‘Qualified person: The decision under section 36 on whether a disclosure | would or would be likely to have the prejudicial or inhibiting effects specified can be taken only by a qualified person. The qualified person cannot delegate this decision making function to others’. By contrast, the Commissioner’s guidance reads (paragraph 13): | ‘The public authority cannot choose the qualified person themselves; nor can | the qualified person delegate the authority to someone else. If there is no one 1BA/2014/2016 | 4currently in that post, and another officer has been formally given that post | holder’s responsibilities on an “acting” basis, then that officer is effectively the qualified person. This is not the case if the qualified person is simply unavailable for a short time, eg on leave’. : ¢ 9 July 2015: The Commissioner lodged his Response, drafted by Counsel, Mr | Rupert Paines. In paragraph 41, the Response defended the Commissioner's | position with regard to the identity of the QP. The Response argued that, | although the guidance said that a QP’s role could not be delegated if, for example, an individual was on leave, it also said that, where the putative QP had formally been given the post holder’s responsibilities on an acting basis, that would suffice. A statement by the Director of Nursing that she was acting Chief Executive was sufficient. However, the Commissioner intended to make further enquiries of the Trust ¢ 21 July 2015: Mr O'Hanlon took issue with this analysis in his Reply. He pointed out that the Response omitted the words ‘If there is no one currently in that post’ before “and another officer has been formally given that post holder’s responsibilities on an acting basis’ in the Commissioner's quote from the Commissioner’s guidance. Here, the Trust’s Chief Executive remained in post and was simply on short-term leave. e 1 October 2015: the Commissioner lodged a further pleading (called a Response to the Appellant’s Reply), including this sentence: ‘To obviate any concern on this point, the Trust has now provided two further qualified person's opinions signed by the Chief Executive Ms Kane on 31 July 2015. The Commissioner has reviewed their contents and is satisfied that the opinions stated therein are reasonable’ (It is not clear why there were two new opinions when there only appears to have been one originally. For ease of reference, the Tribunal will refer to the second set compendiously as ‘the second opinion’) | e 5 October 2015: the date originally set for the hearing was used for directions, | principally to enable the Trust to be added as a respondent. Mr Paines | represented the Commissioner. Mr O’Hanlon says the hearing was largely : closed | | | e 19 November 2015: the Trust lodged its Response. In paragraph 31, it said that the second opinion ‘[was] provided at the request of the Commissioner; , the purpose is in effect to corroborate those given in August 2014, not to | | replace them’. The request was, it seems, made on 24 July 2015, three days _ after Mr O’Hanlon’s Response. Ms Kane confirmed the Response’s assertion | in a witness statement 5 |© 9 December 2015: the Commissioner lodged a further submission (the | December 2015 submission). He said: 2’... the Commissioner intends to revise | this paragraph of the Guidance so that the intended meaning is clear’. This a | followed a statement that ‘paragraph 13 is capable of being misinterpreted to ' preclude delegation in the third situation’. The Commissioner summarised : the third situation thus: ‘The situation where a formal delegation has taken place during a period of absence (including situations where there is a temporary vacancy in the relevant role), such that the person to whom | . authority is delegated stands in the shoes of the QP during the period of the ~ QP’s unavailability’. Mr O’Hanlon refers to 9 December 2015 as “the snapshot | : date’ > | e 9 March 2016: the 2015 Tribunal heard the 2015 appeal. The Trust was | represented but the Commissioner was not. Mr O'Hanlon represented ot himself. By the time of the hearing, only three pages of email exchanges : remained in issue. | : e 30 April 2016: the 2015 Tribunal gave its decision. It held that section 40(2) | applied to various names, job titles and work contact details in the emails. In relation to section 36(2)(b)(ii) and the question whether the Director of | Nursing was a QP, the Tribunal recorded 4 that the Commissioner’s Counsel | ‘disagreed with the guidance and told us that there are plans to amend it’. It | accepted 5 the Trust’s submission that there was ‘a distinction between ‘| delegating an isolated aspect of the Chief Executive’s function such as providing an QP opinion, and someone else assuming the role of the Chief Executive (albeit on a temporary basis) in which case they assume all the powers and responsibilities associated with that role’. The Commissioner's | _ guidance, the Tribunal said, was internally inconsistent: it could make no | difference whether a delegate was acting up for a short time or a longer time. | Since she had been properly delegated, the Director of Nursing stood in the | shoes of the Chief Executive and was able to exercise any powers or functions _ that the Chief Executive could, including giving an opinion as QP. The Tribunal considered that, although there was doubt about the reasonableness of the Director of Nursing’s opinion, the Chief Executive’s opinion was both valid and reasonable such that there was no need to determine the reasonableness of the Director of Nursing’s Opinion. The public interest favoured withholding the emails in question. It admitted the Chief | _ Executive’s opinion as a late exemption. ° - 2 Para 19 | _ 3 The first situation is. where the OP is a body corporate: delegation is then not possible (see Guardian Newspapers and Brooke v Information Commissioner and the BBC EA/2006/0011 and 0013), and the second is where the QP is unavailable but no formal delegation of role has taken place 4 Para 43 | 5 Para 44 | 6 See Birkett v Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [2011] EWCA Civ 1606 | 6The Tribunal was critical of the Commissioner’s scrutiny of the Trust's claim about the extent of information within the scope of the request it held: | considerable further material was identified by the Trust and disclosed during the course of the appeal. To that extent, the Trust was in breach of section 1 FOIA. | ¢ 4 May 2016: Upper Tribunal Judge Markus refused Mr O’Hanlon permission to appeal. One of his grounds was that the 2015 Tribunal should not, applying Birkett, 7 have relied on the second QP opinion. Judge Markus rejected that ground. She did, however, disagree with the Tribunal that the second opinion constituted a late exemption: rather, it supported an exemption which the Trust had always relied on. The request | 10. Mr O'Hanlon made the present request on 12 January 2017 [103]. It was long and discursive and invoked a mixture of subsections (a) and (b) of section 1 FOIA: | | whether information was held and, if so, its disclosure. He explained the background and identified the subject of the request as: “All information brought into existence since 19 March 2015 and held in respect of the consideration and/or implementation and/or communication of possible or intended revisions to paragraph 13 of the above mentioned Guide; to include those data more specifically enumerated below’. 11. The Guide to which Mr O’Hanlon referred was the Commissioner guidance and 19 March 2015 was the date the current version was issued. He sought confirmation or denial that (a) the ICO had considered revision of the guidance ‘in the period in question’: (b) any decision amounting to a settled intention to make any such revision; or (c) the | | | communication of any such decision. At the hearing, Mr O’Hanlon accepted that, since | the request was made on 12 January 2017, the period in question extended until then, not | 9 December 2015 when the Commissioner put in the December submission in the 2015 | appeal. However, he said he was principally interested in the period between 19 March 2015 and 9 December 2015 (his snapshot date). 12.Mr O’Hanlon also requested disclosure of information which (a) evidenced ‘that | decision’ (presumably a decision ‘amounting to a settled intention’ to revise the - | guidance); (b) included the wording or draft wording of any possible or intended revision: (c) evidenced the conveying of that decision either internally within the IC or from the | ICO to Counsel who drafted the December 2015 submission; or (d) evidenced discussion or consultation undertaken either within the ICO or with others (including the MoJ and any NHS Trust concerning the scope of the wording of the | intended revision or any possible alternative forms of any such revision). | ’ The Upper Tribunal decision and that of the Court of Appeal: Birkett v DEFRA [2012] AACR 32 |13. This was all rather long-winded: what Mr O’Hanlon wanted was documents relating to any decision to revise the guidance along with any subsequent revision (assuming they | | existed and were held). ' The Commissioner's initial response and review | 14. At [106] is an internal ICO note dated 9 February 2017 by the lead information , | access officer of the searches undertaken following receipt of the request. It _ records that part of the file relating to the 2015 appeal was regarded as within scope, notably emails between Sonia Taylor, the ICO’s in-house solicitor who had : acted in the 2015 appeal, and its Counsel, Mr Paines, and between Ms Taylorand internal ICO clients. A ‘policy summary’ of the Tribunal’s decision on the 2015 a ! appeal was also regarded as within scope. : 15. The note records that the information officer discussed with Ms Taylor which | items from the 2015 appeal file identified as being within scope were subject to | legal professional privilege (LPP) and therefore prima facie exempt under section | : 42(1) FOIA. Ms Taylor advised that the whole file was subject to LPP. The note | says: ‘[Ms Taylor] said that in order to protect the confidentiality of the advice | sought, received and discussed about this issue, which is yet to be resolved to the | extent that the ICO guidance has not yet been revised, she would be reluctant for . any of it to be disclosed under the FOIA’. The information officer then consulted someone else (whose name is redacted) who advised that LPP did indeed apply to all the material, thereby engaging section 42(1), and that the public interest favoured withholding the information. | | | 16. Finally, the note records a conversation with the author (name again redacted) of | the summary of the 2015 Tribunal’s decision in the ICO’s FOI Policy | Knowledgebase (the Knowledgebase). The information officer had explained that | section 1 of the Knowledgebase (Summary of FTT Decision) would be withheld | and section 2 (Summary of ICO Decision) had already been published on the | website. The author had no concern about the disclosure of section 3, which discussed amending paragraph 13 of the Commissioner's guidance. 17. The Commissioner responded to the request on 10 February 2017 [108]. She explained that there were three broad categories of information considered within scope. The first constituted records relating to the ICO’s consideration and | handling of the 2015 appeal. All that information was withheld under section 42(1). The public interest favoured withholding the information, principally because the information ‘discusses the pros and cons of an approach at tribunal, a and therefore the relative strengths and weakness of the published current guidance’ and because ‘the advice sought and received is “live” (in that the | guidance amendment work has not been completed) and “recent”, in that the decision of the Upper Tribunal [refusing permission to appeal] was only made on 1 December 2016’. There was a strong public interest in maintaining the | | confidentiality of communications between client and lawyer. 818. The second category constituted the Knowledgebase. The first section was | withheld under section 42(1). The remaining two sections [115]-[117] were disclosed. The case officer said that the Commissioner’s guidance had not yet | been revised (Ms Gannon confirmed at the hearing that that was still the case). An extract from the Tribunal Decisions Spreadsheet [118] (the third category) was also disclosed, giving brief details about the 2015 appeal and including under the heading Any work required? ‘Amend wording in s.36 guidance (para 13) to clarify position re Acting QPs’. | 19.On 10 February 2017 [119], Mr O’Hanlon sent the information officer an email | | suggesting that her response did not comply with section 1(1)(a) FOIA, which entitled him to be informed if the ICO did not hold the relevant information, here the Commissioner's stated intention as at 9 December 2015 to revise paragraph 13 _ of her guidance. In her reply of 17 February 2017 [120], the case officer said that the ICO did hold this information. However, it was caught by section 42(1). 20. On 23 February 2017 [121], Mr O’Hanlon sent a formal request for a review. Much of his argument, both in relation to LPP and the public interest test, was predicated on Counsel having misled the Tribunal in the 2015 appeal by asserting in the December 2015 submission that the Commissioner intended to revise her guidance. He also argued that LPP, assuming it applied, had been waived by the submission’s referring to the Commissioner's intention to revise the guidance. He also noted, in relation to public interest, that it was the Commissioner who had requested the Trust to procure a second QP opinion. 21. The review was sent to Mr O’Hanlon by the Group Manager at the ICO on 24 March 2017 [126]. The Group Manager suggested (not quite accurately) that the grounds on which Mr O’Hanlon had requested a review were all predicated on | the statement in the December 2015 submission being false. She said it was not | false. She had looked more broadly at the application of section 42(1) and had | concluded that it was correctly applied because it represented information exchanged between the Commissioner’s solicitor, her internal client and Counsel. : She adopted the information officer’s reasoning on public interest. | | Complaint to the Commissioner | 22. Mr O’Hanlon submitted a complaint to the Commissioner on 11 April 2017 [130]. He repeated his claim that Counsel had misled the Tribunal in the 2015 appeal. Privilege could not apply in those circumstances. If there was no decision at that time to amend the guidance, he was entitled to a denial that the Commissioner : held the information. If there was privilege, it had been waived by pleading the intention to revise the guidance. 23. An email from the ICO department which had dealt with Mr O’Hanlon’s request | to Ms Samantha Coward, senior case officer, on 21 August 2017 [144] confirmed that the guidance had not yet been revised (but it would be). It repeated the L 3 :arguments why LPP applied, including that the documents in question were created for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance in relation to rights L and obligations, specifically for the 2015 appeal and revision of the guidance. The L principle of safeguarding the openness in communications between client and . L lawyer was fundamental. It was in the public interest for the Commissioner to be - L able to get frank advice from her legal counsel to allow her to make the L - appropriate decisions with regard to the legislation she regulated. There was a public interest in the public understanding the issues around delegated authority | relating to section 36 FOIA but this was outweighed by the public interest in , maintaining the confidentiality of legal advice: sharing the advice ‘would > | undermine the confidence in the ICO and its own published guidance and create | unintended confusion for those that are working with the section 36 exemption’. The Commissioner's decision | 24. The Commissioner considered the arguments advanced by her office and | concluded that the withheld information ‘constitutes communications and information exchanged with her internal client and Counsel and so attracts legal professional privilege’ (paragraph 15). As the ICO had maintained, the fact that : the advice was ‘live’ (in that the guidance had not yet been revised) and recent | argued for applying LPP. It was best to allow the ICO the time and space to consider revision of the guidance without premature disclosure and potential scrutiny. Full and frank legal advice was fundamental to the administration of justice. The Grounds of Appeal and the Commissioner's Response 25.Mr O’Hanlon’s detailed Grounds of Appeal were again predicated on the | statement in the December 2015 submission being false. ° In any event, he said that paragraph 15 of the Decision Notice contained an error of law by assuming that communications and information exchanged between a solicitor and her internal client and external Counsel attracted LPP regardless of their content, | confidentiality or purpose. ? 26.Mr O’Hanlon also complained that the Decision Notice skated over the background and failed to mention, for example, that the Commissioner had invited the Trust to issue a second QP opinion during the course of the 2015 appeal. 27. With regard to public interest, Mr O'Hanlon argued 1° that public confidence in the Commissioner and her guidance was irrelevant to LPP. The purpose of LPP 8 Mr O’Hanlon referred, in paragraph 42, to the ICO’s ‘tantalising assertion’ that the statement in the December 2015 submission was ‘not false’ which he sought to distinguish from its being true 9 See para 8 of the Grounds 0 Para 30 10was to further the administration of justice, not to protect the reputation of a ~ public authority. 28. As a remedy, Mr O'Hanlon sought a substituted decision notice on the basis that the December 2015 submission was materially false and LPP could not therefore apply, alternatively, the public interest in disclosing such a falsity outweighed that in preserving LPP. 29. The Commissioner’s Response referred 1 to the two types of LPP: litigation | privilege and advice privilege (see further below). The latter applied irrespective of whether litigation was contemplated, although in fact the majority of the withheld information was created by or for lawyers for the dominant purpose of litigation such that litigation privilege applied to that information (advice _ privilege applied to all of it). 12 | 30. The Commissioner denied that she had acted in any way dishonestly, as would be clear from the closed material. At the time of the December 2015 submission there was an intention to amend the guidance to clarify any ambiguity. That remained the position. She added }° that, even if she had been dishonest, that would not prevent the LPP exemption being engaged and would only go to public interest. | 31. The Commissioner also said that she did not hold any further information within the scope of the request, as Mr O’Hanlon appeared to be suggesting, and had conducted the reasonable search required by caselaw in this regard. 1 It was not for the Tribunal to adjudicate on the adequacy of the search. 15 | 32. Mr O'Hanlon’ Reply dated 24 November 2017 [36] is another long document (20 closely-typed, closely-argued pages). There was little which was new but he did | make these points. The onus of establishing LPP lay on the Commissioner: it was not sufficient to rely on the fact that documents passed between a lawyer and his lay client (see the recent case of Serious Fraud Office v Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation Ltd (ENRC)). 16 By contrast, he accepted that the onus lay on him to | show that the Commissioner had intended to mislead the 2015 Tribunal. He was ‘certain’ that no record of any relevant intention to amend the guidance existed as at 9 December 2015. 17 However, the statement of intention to revise ‘was always of marginal relevance to the [2015 appeal] especially as it followed upon, as if to give more weight to, the disclosure of associated legal opinions’. 18 Mr 4 Para 15 | 12 Para 24 | | 13 Para 24 | L 4 Reed v Information Commissioner (Information Tribunal) (3 July 2009) | 1S Para 31 : ¥6 (2017) EWHC 1017 (8 May 2017) http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/ EWHC/QB/2017/1017.htm!l An | E appeal from the decision is due to be heard by the Court of Appeal in early July 2018 7 Para 13 L 8 Para 17 |. O'Hanlon speculated three propositions: 1° that no one, certainly no one with the | requisite authority, held the pleaded intention, that the person closest to holding oe any such intention was within the ICO’s litigation team; and that any intention of was a purely personal and possibly unspoken one ‘which it was convenient to | put into the tribunal litigation, rather than an intention to provide authoritative | guidance to the public at large. The phrase “win at all costs” is apt to describe = | that possibility’. Mr O'Hanlon also said that the Commissioner's Response did not differentiate between advice privilege and litigation advice according to the | date of communication. 7° a | Preliminary question: jurisdiction | _ 33. As noted, the public authority of which Mr O’Hanlon made his request for . information was the Commissioner herself. When she rejected his request, Mr O’/Hanlon made a complaint to her, as he appeared bound to do under section 90 FOIA. The Commissioner determined the complaint. On the face of it, this was a : clear breach of the principle of natural justice that no one should be judge inher | own cause (nemo iudex in causa sua in Latin). Or, to put it another way, the : Commissioner’s decision appeared to be infected by bias. It does not matter whether the Commissioner would be actually biased when dealing with a | complaint against her own decision: under public law apparent bias is enough to | condemn a decision. As Lord Hope put it in the leading case of Porter v Magill, * | the question is ‘whether the fair minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the | [decision-maker] was biased’. Such an observer might well conclude that there was a real possibility that the Commissioner would be biased when determining a complaint against her own decision. | | 34. In these circumstances, did the Commissioner have jurisdiction to determine Mr O’Hanlon’s complaint? If not, the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal either, because the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is co-terminus with, and parasitic on, the Commissioner's. It has been suggested * that the solution in these circumstances is for the Commissioner’s investigation to be as thorough and transparent as possible. With respect, that does not meet the jurisdictional | problem, because the Commissioner's investigation should be as thorough and transparent as possible in all cases. 35. Neither party had raised the jurisdictional issue in terms (although Mr O’Hanlon had expressed disquiet during the course of the complaint about the objectivity of ICO staff: see below). However, matters of jurisdiction are for the court or tribunal hearing a case: the parties cannot confer jurisdiction where none exists. 1 Para 46 20 Para 87 21 [2002] 2. AC 357 at 103 (House of Lords 22 Ritchie v Information Commissioner EA/ 2011/0727 http: / /informationrights.decisions.tribunals.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/1547/ 20110727 % 20Decision % 20EA20110041 pdf . | 12At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal indicated that it might wish to receive written submissions on the issue after the hearing. In the event, it has come to the clear conclusion that the Commissioner did have jurisdiction and so, therefore, | does the Tribunal. Having raised the matter, it is right that the Tribunal should | explain its reasoning. : | 36. The problem arises from the fact that the Commissioner has a dual role under _ FOIA: she is both, for the purposes of section 3(1) and schedule 1, a public | authority to whom requests for information may be made, and also the determiner of complaints brought under section 50 by disappointed requesters. _ Where the public authority is anyone other than the Commissioner, she can provide independent adjudication. Where she is the public authority, she cannot do so, however objective the staff dealing with the complaint seek to be and whatever systems are put in place to ensure separation between those who made the original and internal review decisions and those who deal with the complaint. 37. The correspondence relating to Mr O’Hanlon’s request and the internal review and Decision Notice, and indeed the Commissioner’s Response, seek to draw a distinction between the ICO, on the one hand, and the Commissioner, on the other. The request was dealt with in the name of the ICO and the Decision Notice on the section 50 complaint was in the Commissioner’s name. This is a false distinction. As explained above, in law there is but one body, the Commissioner, a corporation sole. She is the public authority listed in schedule 1. Her office helps her carry out her tasks but it is not a separate legal entity. | 38. In the present case, Mr O’Hanlon understood the problem. In his email sent on | 12 July 2017 to Ms Coward, the case officer dealing with the complaint [140], he expressed concern that she had referred in her email of the same day to ‘liaising with colleagues’ who had dealt with his request. Ms Coward sought to reassure him [141] that she would deal with the complaint Just like any other but Mr © O'Hanlon was not reassured [142]. In his Reply [36, 41], he alleges that the | Commissioner, on his complaint, paid ‘undue deference ... to the ICO’s own FOI | personnel and that this led to no real scrutiny or impartial investigation ...’. In the correspondence with the. ICO he describes a ‘clear conflict of interests’, heightened by the fact that the reason for his request was his unhappiness about the way with which the Commissioner had dealt with the 2015 appeal and in particular with the parts played by her in-house lawyers and external Counsel. | | Mr O'Hanlon was concerned that the exemption on which the Commissioner | now relied, section 42(1), was being used to conceal wrongdoing in the earlier appeal. Although he does not point this out, the ICO lawyer who acted in the L 2015 appeal was asked to give, and gave, her opinion as to whether LPP applied. | | 39. In those circumstances, Lord Hope’s observer might indeed have especial doubt L about the ability of the Commissioner to bring independent judgement to bear on | the complaint. It is true that, in the particular circumstances, the possibility of 13 oo Lbias arises as much with the original request (and the internal review) as with the | complaint. However, bias may often be suspected of a public authority dealing | | with FOIA requests, if the requested information might, for example, be E embarrassing for it. The point of the section 50 process is that it provides oo independent adjudication, cleansed of any bias on the part of the authority. That | L was not possible in the present case. | | 40. Whether the Commissioner has jurisdiction to determine a complaint against her | : | own decision is a question of statutory construction. The particular facts of Mr I O’Hanlon’s case can help to illustrate the problem but the Tribunal’s perspective | I has to be broader. As with all questions of statutory construction, its task is to / ascertain the intention of Parliament from the words used, applying the accepted | canons. In truth, seeking the intention of Parliament can be an artificial construct. The reality may be that Parliament did not turn its mind to the set of circumstances with which a court or tribunal is faced. There are over 100,000 public authorities listed in schedule 1 to FOIA. With all but one, no question of a . : conflict arises on complaints under section 50 and no one may have thought what > | should happen in the single case. But the Tribunal has to proceed on the : - assumption that Parliament did form an intention with regard to that case. : 41. There are certainly indicia in FOIA that Parliament did not intend a complaint | against refusal by the Commissioner of a request for information to be made to | the Commissioner herself. For example, section 50(3)(b) says that the | Commissioner must ‘serve notice of [her] decision (in this Act referred to as a | “decision notice”) on the complainant and the public authority’. It would be odd | for the Commissioner to serve notice on herself (in the present case, she sent her | decision to the ICO, but as explained above that is the same thing). Similarly, section 50(4)(b) requires the Commissioner, where she concludes that a public authority is in breach of Part 1 of FOIA, to ‘specify the steps which must be taken by the authority for complying with that requirement and the period within which they must be taken’. It would be strange for her to tell herself what she must do. | 42. Under section 51, the Commissioner may serve on the public authority an information notice requiring it to provide her with information to aid her deliberations (but, under subsection (5), not where this would breach LPP). Under section 52, the Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice on a public authority in breach of Part 1. Under section 54, where a public authority has | failed to comply with a decision notice, an information notice or an enforcement notice, the Commissioner may bring proceedings against it in the High Court or, in Scotland, in the Court of Sessions. Section 55 and schedule 3 give the | Commissioner the power to apply for a warrant to enter and search premises. In | all these cases, Parliament cannot, it might be argued, have had in mind the Commissioner as the public authority. 14 | |_ 43. None of this is determinative, however. It is unlikely that the Commissioner would, in practice, need to use the coercive powers given her by sections 51, 52, 4 and 55 - she can ensure that her staff cooperate - and the oddities arising from | section 50(3)(b) and (4)(b) are no more than that. The critical question, it seems to | the Tribunal, is whether a disappointed requester would have an alternative means of redress. As a matter of general principle, where there is no right of challenge through a statutory vehicle, a citizen can make an application for judicial review. In principle, a requester denied information by the Commissioner might be able to bring a judicial review. If so, it would not be wholly satisfactory because judicial reviews can be expensive, with a significant fee and the risk of an adverse costs order where a losing claimant is not legally- | aided (as would probably be the case with a FOIA challenge). Section 50 complaints, by contrast, are free, with no risk of adverse costs if a complaint is rejected. | 44. But, more than that, judicial review would not be available in all the circumstances where a disappointed requester can bring a section 50 complaint. Judicial reviews can only be brought where there has been an error of law. Section 50 complaints, by contrast, can be brought to challenge a finding of fact (for example, whether a public authority holds information) or a judgement, with qualified exemptions, as to where the public interest lies. An error of law for judicial review purposes can include an irrational finding of fact or exercise of judgement (Wednesbury unreasonableness, as it is known), but that is a high hurdle. A section 50 complainant does not have to overcome such a high hurdle: the Commissioner can simply substitute her own view of the facts or her own judgement. | 49. In short: although judicial review would be available for some requesters of | information from the Commissioner, it would not be available for all. And, | because of fees and costs, it is questionable whether it is an effective alternative remedy for any. Parliament cannot have intended that requesters for information from the Commissioner would be left without an effective or any remedy. For this reason, the Tribunal has concluded that, unsatisfactory though the position | is, this is a rare case where Parliament intended an exception to the nemo iudex in | causa sua principle. 46. The Tribunal is fortified in its conclusion by the availability of an appeal to the , Tribunal. Appeals against decision notices are a complete rehearing: factual findings can be disputed and new evidence can be introduced. In the unlikely | event that a decision by the Commissioner was infected by actual bias, the | Tribunal could rectify the position. So it can with apparent bias. | : 47. A right to information constitutes a ‘civil right or obligation’, entitling a | disappointed requester to a ‘fair and public hearing’, for the purposes of Article 6 | 15 | Lof the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). *? The European : Court of Human Rights has consistently held that a contracting state, such as the L UK, is not in breach of Article 6 where a higher judicial body can correct a L procedural defect of a lower body. The Tribunal can rectify the apparent biasin i the Commissioner’s decision in the present case. 7 a L 48. The question of jurisdiction where the Commissioner is the public authority does | not appear to have been previously determined. However, in Colenso-Dunn v i"" Information Commissioner, ** Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley was alive to the | problem and appeared untroubled, explicitly because of the option of a rehearing | before the Tribunal: | : ‘This dual role [of the Commissioner] may only serve to fuel some of the more outlandish conspiracy theories that abound on the internet. Certainly, as the First-tier Tribunal noted in its preliminary decision on this appeal, this conundrum 1s “an , unusual, and unsatisfactory, feature of this area of the law” (at paragraph [1]). So, as the Honourable Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip would | doubtless ask, “Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?” Who will watch the watchmen? The : answer is that the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) - or “the | Tribunal”, previously the Information Tribunal -— does (and, on any further appeal, the Upper Tribunal), at least within the limited confines of their respective appellate : jurisdictions’. 49. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that it does have jurisdiction to determine the present appeal. | The substantive merits of the appeal LPP in general | | | 50. In ENRC, Mrs Justice Andrews gave a helpful summary of the principles of LPP, as derived from jurisprudence both domestic and Commonwealth. The principal domestic case of recent years is the House of Lords decision in Three Rivers DCv Bank of England (No 6). 26 The propositions of particular relevance to the present case set out in ENRC and elsewhere are: © The confidentiality of legal communications is a human right under both Articles 6 and 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention?’ 23 See, for example, Collectif national d’information et d’opposition a l’usine Melox — Collectif Stop Melox and Mox v. France; Selmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, para 47; and Shapovalov v. Ukraine, para 49 | 412015] UKUT 0471 (AAC) https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/up loads/2015/08/gia_-702_2014.pdf ?5 Para 2 26 [2004] UKHL 48, [2005] 1 AC 610 2” See, for example, Golder v United Kingdom (1979-80) 1 EHRR 924 (Article 6) and Niemitz v Germany a (1993) 16 EHRR 97 (Article 8) 16¢ The onus of establishing privilege is on the party asserting it ¢ Communications between parties or their solicitors and third parties for the purpose of obtaining information or advice in connection with existing litigation or litigation reasonably in contemplation attract litigation privilege provided the communications are made with the sole or dominant purpose of conducting the litigation and the litigation is adversarial, not investigative or inquisitorial 28 e Legal advice privilege attaches to all communications passing between a client and his or her lawyers, acting in their professional capacity, in connection with the provision of legal advice which ‘relates to the rights, liabilities, obligations or remedies of the client either under private law or under public law’ (Three Rivers (No 6) per Lord Scott at [38]). There is no need for litigation to be contemplated or in existence 2° | ¢ Legal advice privilege attaches to all the material forming part of the continuum of lawyer/client communications even if each communication does not expressly seek or convey legal advice: Balabel v Air India 3° e The rationale underlying legal advice privilege is that it encourages full and frank communication between lawyers and their clients, which promotes the rule of law and the administration of justice: Three Rivers (No 6). 3! It is therefore an essential prerequisite of the claim to privilege that the communication passing between lawyer and client is confidential: Three Rivers (No 6) at [24]. The communication may be confidential even if what is communicated to the lawyer for the purpose of seeking or | obtaining the advice is not confidential. | e It is important to distinguish between the two forms of privilege. In ENRC, | Andrews J said: | ‘Strictly speaking, and despite numerous references in the authorities to lawyer-client communications made for the dominant purpose of litigation as being within litigation privilege, or as covered by litigation privilege as well — | as legal advice privilege, this is wrong, as Three Rivers (No 6) made plain. If the communication is between client (or the client's agent) and lawyer for the | purpose of obtaining legal advice in connection with anticipated litigation, it | is covered by legal advice privilege rather than litigation privilege. If the communication is between the lawyer and someone other than the client, it will only be subject to LPP if it satisfies the test for litigation privilege. That is ara 51 : * Para 61 of ENRC. Litigation privilege did not apply in Three Rivers (No 6) because the claim to privilege arose out of the non-adversarial Bingham Inquiry into the Bank of England’s supervision of | BCCI / 30 [1988] 1 Ch 317 31 at [30] - [35] :so whether the client is an individual, a partnership, an unincorporated : association or a corporate entity ...’. ' e The essential difference between litigation privilege and advice privilege, | therefore, is that the latter involves communications between lawyer (solicitor i and counsel) and client whereas the former involves communications with | | | third parties (for the purposes of litigation) ' e With a corporate client, the employee with whom the lawyer communicates must be authorised to give instructions and obtain legal advice: that is a . question of fact. In Skandinavisak Enskilda Banken AB v Asia Pacific Breweries | (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others, 32 the Court of Appeal of Singapore said that implied authorisation suffices ‘if that function is related to or arises out of the | relevant employee’s work’. That is also the view of the leading textbook, The Law of Privilege, by Thanki, Goodall et al, ° quoted, with apparent approval, | : by Andrews J *# | e The judge said 35 that ‘[it] might be persuasively argued that the company’s | in-house lawyers or general counsel would have the necessary authority, by -virtue of their office, to seek and obtain legal advice from external lawyers on behalf of the company’ | | e Privilege will be waived where reference to a document is made in court documents or where the content of legal advice is referred to *° e Communications in furtherance of a crime or fraud are not within the | | ordinary scope of the lawyer-client relationship and are therefore not | privileged °” | | e There is no public interest test to be applied in deciding whether | communications attract LPP (but see below with regard section 42(1) FOIA). The categories of documents forming the disputed information 51. As Mr O'Hanlon is aware (because he has an index to the closed bundle), the documents forming the disputed information consists of: (i) the Summary of FIT | Decision (i.e. the 2015 appeal), part of the Knowledgebase; (ii) communications between the Commissioner’s Counsel, Mr Paines, and her solicitor, Ms Taylor, and between Ms Taylor and ICO policy staff between 30 November and 8 December 2015 along with Mr Paines’ draft of the submission which became the 32 [2007] SGCA 9 | | 33 2nd ed, 2011 35 [92] 6 See Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 901 37 See, for example, Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Company [2005] EWCA Civ 286 | 18December 2015 submission; and (iii) internal ICO correspondence following promulgation of the 2015 Tribunal’s decision. 92. The Tribunal will consider each in turn. (a) Knowledgebase 03. As noted above, the Commissioner has disclosed those parts of the Knowledgebase appearing under the headings Summary of ICO Decision and section 36: QP not available to give opinion. The former gave a brief summary of the Decision Notice. The latter contained a critique of the Tribunal’s decision in the 2015 appeal and suggested that the Tribunal had not understood the meaning the Commissioner was trying to convey in her guidance, which the section then explained. The section concluded: ‘We will reword this part of [our] guidance to _ explain this point more clearly. There is no disagreement of substance between ourselves and the FIT, but given the apparent misunderstanding this point is flagged amber’. ‘CW’ was given as the policy contact and he seems to have been the author. | 94. Since, the section analysed the Tribunal decision and the action which was needed in light of it, the (present) Tribunal expressed surprise that LPP was not therefore claimed. The explanation given was that it was written by a non- lawyer. | | — 09. The Commissioner has withheld the first section of the Knowledgebase document, headed Summary of FIT Decision. Although unsigned, it was apparently written by the case lawyer in the 2015 appeal, Ms Taylor. The Tribunal has concluded that the Commissioner has improperly withheld it. The i summary does just what the title says: it summarises the Tribunal decision in the | 2015 appeal. It attached the decision. Unlike the Section 36: QP not available to give | opinion section, it attempts no critique of the Tribunal decision and does not : suggest the way forward. | 56. The potentially applicable specie of LPP is legal advice privilege, not litigation privilege, because the communication in question is from a lawyer to her client. The fact that the communication related to litigation is irrelevant: see ENRC. In any event, at the time when the summary was prepared litigation (the 2015 : appeal) was neither in contemplation nor in progress. Mr O’Hanlon later made | an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, but the summary was not written with that application in mind. | | 9/7. In the Tribunal’s judgment, the summary does not constitute legal advice. Legal | advice privilege, axiomatically, presupposes legal advice (relating ‘to the rights, L liabilities, obligations or remedies of the client either under private law or under | | public law:’ Three Rivers (No 6)). As Mr O'Hanlon pointed out, the fact that a document contains a communication from a lawyer to his or her client is not :sufficient: it must contain legal advice. The summary is in the nature of : information, not advice. : 58. At the hearing, Ms Gannon argued that to summarise a court or tribunal decision | L requires legal skill and therefore constitutes legal advice. The Tribunal does not doubt that understanding and explaining a legal judgment may indeed require | the skill of a lawyer. However, the particular audience is important. The audience | here is expert in FOIA. Some of its members would themselves be lawyers. But even the non-lawyers - for example, policy personnel - were quite capable of | iL understanding the 2015 appeal decision, as demonstrated by the factthatapolicy : employee prepared a critique of it (and could, therefore, have provided the | summary). | | 59. Summaries of Tribunal decisions are no doubt prepared to save the time of those who need to keep abreast of the caselaw. There may be Tribunal decisions which | are of such complexity that they need an ICO lawyer to explain them to non- | lawyers. However, the Tribunal decision in the 2015 appeal is not one of them. Legal advice privilege presupposes a disparity in relevant expertise between the maker of a communication and the receiver which the communication is designed to address, so that the receiver is equipped to make appropriate | decisions. With regard to understanding the 2015 Tribunal decision, in the Tribunal’s judgment there is no disparity in expertise between the author of the Summary of FTT Decision and its intended audience. _ (b) Communications leading up to the December 2015 written submission 60. This category of documents (dated between 30 November and 8 December 2015) | consists of (i) communications between Ms Taylor and Mr Paines, (ii) : communications between Ms Taylor and senior policy personnel and a senior lawyer within the ICO, Mr Adam Sowerbutts; and (iii) a draft submission | prepared by Mr Paines, with comments by one of the policy employees. The draft | submission became the December 2015 submission. . 61. Once again, if LPP apples, it is legal advice privilege not litigation privilege, even though the communications related to litigation. 62. Mr O'Hanlon has based his whole case on the assumption that the statement in | | the December 2015 submission about revision of the guidance was false. He | believes that no decision to revise had been made and that, at best, the | desirability of revision was something which occurred to a member of the [CO litigation team in the 2015 appeal without their having instructions from the Commissioner. Mr O’Hanlon has, of course, not had the benefit of seeing the | documents. The Tribunal has and can state unequivocally that they do recognise that the guidance would have to be revised, if only for clarification. Since Mr O’Hanlon has questioned their integrity, it is important to say that the documents reveal that the conduct of Ms Taylor and Mr Paines - solicitor and counsel in the 202015 appeal - is beyond reproach with regard to the passage in question in the December 2015 submission. They had clear instructions to say that the guidance would be revised. 63. The documents clearly contain legal advice communicated by lawyers to their clients. Legal advice privilege therefore prima facie applies. However, the Tribunal must consider authorisation and waiver. 64. As Andrews J explained in ENRC, for legal advice privilege to apply with a corporate client the person giving instructions and receiving advice on behalf of the client must be authorised to do so. The Tribunal has not seen any evidence that the policy employees involved in the correspondence with Ms Taylor had been expressly authorised by the Commissioner to give instructions and receive advice. However, in the Tribunal’s judgment, it does not matter whether they did hold such express authorisation. Both the Court of Appeal of Singapore judgement in Skandinavisa and the passage from Thanki quoted with apparent approval by the judge indicate that implied authorisation is sufficient. In the Tribunal'’s judgment, that must be right. In many corporations, authority will be obvious from the position which the relevant employee holds. That is the case here: the positions of the ICO employees giving instructions were Group Manager Policy Delivery and Senior Policy Officer. Within the ICO structure, it is inherent in these positions that the employees would have authority to give instructions and receive advice and the Tribunal accepts that they did. The Commissioner could not be expected to be personally involved in every appeal. The Senior Policy Officer was, in fact, the author of the guidance and therefore eminently suited to give instructions as to its intended meaning and whether a revision was necessary. | | 69. The Tribunal is satisfied that legal advice privilege applies to this category of | documents. The next question is whether privilege has been waived. Ms Gannon, relying on Mersey Tunnels Users’ Association v Information Commissioner and Mersey Travel, °° suggested that, in the context of section 42(1), it was more appropriate to consider whether the advice had been disclosed on a restricted or unrestricted : basis. The distinction she seemed to draw was between a FOIA disclosure (which : is generally considered to be to the whole world) and a limited disclosure to the 2015 Tribunal (in the context of a FOIA dispute about separate information). That | is not a valid distinction: Tribunal hearings are for the most part public and, as the Court of Appeal made clear in R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of | Westminster Magistrates’ Court, 9° the default position is that, when a document | (such as the December 2015 submission) is referred to in open court, it can then : be used publicly for other purposes. Indeed, in its decision the 2015 Tribunal 98 EA /2007/0052 (15 February 2008) | 39 [2012] EWCA Civ 420 [2013] OB 618 . See also Cox v The Information Commissioner and The Home L Office [2018] UKUT 119 (AAC) (6 April 2018) L | 21 Lrecorded that the Commissioner intended to revise the guidance. #” That decision ' | is available for all to see. } 66. The situation in Mersey Tunnels was very different. The requester had asked fora i copy of Counsel’s opinion given to the public authority about the lawfulness of | certain payments. The District Auditor, no doubt to assuage the requesters L | concerns, had shown him the opinion, but on confidentiality terms (such that the requester was not even able to refer to it in his appeal). There is no such L | restriction here on Mr O’Hanlon’s ability to use the Commissioner's statement of L her intention to revise the guidance. , | 67. The question is whether that statement constitutes waiver of the privilege which | would otherwise attach to it. That is an objective question: whether the I Commissioner intended to waive privilege does not matter. The relevant | paragraph in the December 2015 submission read: | | ‘The Commissioner acknowledges that, in a case such as the present, paragraph 13 [of her guidance] is capable of being misinterpreted to preclude delegation in the third : situation. Two points arise. Firstly, the guidance 1s just that: guidance. It is not authority on the interpretation of FOIA. Secondly, the Commissioner intends to revise this paragraph of the Guidance so that the intended meaning is clear | | (emphasis added). | | 68. In the Tribunal’s judgment, the emphasised sentence does not constitute waiver | of privilege. It does not refer to any document in which legal advice is contained. | It does not give partial disclosure (the usual position with waiver 41). It does not | say how the guidance should be revised, or even that the legal advice was that the guidance was wrong. * It simply recognises that the 2015 appeal had | highlighted a possible ambiguity and that the Commissioner therefore intended | | to revise it. In other words, it does not reveal the content of legal advice in any | meaningful sense. As Ms Gannon said in her skeleton argument, the sentence ‘is a very limited reference to the Commissioner's policy position’. It would be regrettable if the Commissioner were deterred from being candid about possible shortcomings in her guidance for fear that communications between her and her lawyers would then have to be disclosed. That reflects the sentiment of the Tribunal in Mersey Tunnels that ‘[i]t would be unfortunate if through such partial references [such as a brief summary of the conclusion of the disputed advice without revealing the reasoning or other options considered] privilege were lost, | since that result would tend to discourage authorities from revealing even that | much’. In the present case, there is not even a brief summary of legal advice in the relevant passage. | 40 Para 43 | 41 See, for example, R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Ltd [1997] 9 Admin LR 591 | and Paragon Finance PLC v Freshfields [1999] 1 WLR 1183 (per Lord Bingham at 1188 F-G) | “2 The 2015 Tribunal seems to have assumed that that was the Commissioner's position ~ see paragraph 43 of its decision - but it is not clear on what basis 2269. Mr O’Hanlon also argued that LPP cannot apply because the Commissioner misled the Tribunal in the 2015 appeal with regard to an intention to revise the guidance. In her Response, the Commissioner suggested that, had there been dishonesty (which of course she denied), it would only have been relevant to public interest. 70. Since the Tribunal has found that the Commissioner was not dishonest, the point is moot. However, had it found that she had misled the 2015 Tribunal, the present Tribunal would have held that that prevented LPP arising. In the same way that the commission of a crime is not within the ordinary scope of the lawyer-client relationship, nor is misleading a judicial body. (c) Communications post the Tribunal decision in the 2015 appeal /1. This category of documents consists of correspondence between Ms Taylor and her internal client, and between her and Mr Sowerbutts, following receipt of the decision in the 2015 appeal in May 2016. } | | 72. The first item of correspondence, from Ms ‘Taylor to ‘Information Tribunal | Decisions’, is dated 16 May 2016. It is materially identical to the Summary of FTT decision section in the Knowledgebase save that the sentence ‘This appeal would benefit from a policy review’ appears towards the end. The email does not constitute legal advice for the same reason the summary does not. The decision to conduct a policy review had already been taken. Legal advice privilege does not apply (and nor does litigation privilege). 73. The second item, an email from Mr Sowerbutts, was sent, also on 16 May 2016, in | reply to Ms Taylor’s. It seeks factual confirmation unrelated to legal advice. Ms | Taylor gave the confirmation in the first paragraph of her reply sent on 17 May | 2016. That paragraph is similarly not covered by legal advice privilege. However, the other paragraph discusses how the ICO should proceed and does therefore | attract legal advice privilege. There has not been partial disclosure of the advice | and waiver does not therefore apply. Communications between lawyers, internal | or external, can attract LPP. 43 | : _ Public interest /4. Because section 42(1) is a conditional exemption, the Tribunal has to consider where the public interest lies in relation to the closed material to which LPP applies. ‘I'he same considerations apply to the two categories in question. | * Calland v Information Commissioner & the Financial Services Authority EA/ 2007/0136 (8 August 2008) L75. A number of previous cases have remarked “ that there is already a strong public ‘nterest inherent in LPP, because of its importance for the administration of : justice and the confidentiality of communications between lawyer and client or | [ pertaining to litigation. It is a human right. For that reason, the courts have a resisted attempts to allow for exceptions. In Department for Business Enterprise and L Regulatory Reform v O’Brien and The Information Commissioner, Wyn Williams J | approved the approach consistently adopted by the Tribunal, as summarised in | Calland: *° | _ | ‘What is quite plain, from the series of decisions beginning with Bellamy ... is that some clear, compelling and specific justification for disclosure must be shown, so as to outweigh the obvious interest in protecting communications between lawyers and client, which the client supposes to be confidential’. | 76. However, as again has often been noted, the fact that Parliament has chosen to | give the exemption qualified status means that it must have contemplated that there would be circumstances in which the strong public interest underpinning LPP had to cede to some other public interest of at least equal weight. It may be : said that the ceding is more likely where the communication in question relates | to a public law power to revise published guidance than where it relates to a public law duty or power of greater moment or to private law rights and obligations. Even with public law powers of limited import, however, the public interest in protecting relevant communications remains strong. | 77. It is particularly strong where, as in the present case, the advice is recent and remains current. 47 The Commissioner still intends to revise the guidance but has not done so. In the future, if and when she does so, the arguments in favour of maintaining privilege may become weaker. 78. Mr O’Hanlon’s case on public interest principally centred on what he suspected was the misleading of the 2015 Tribunal. Since there was no misleading, that argument inevitably falls away. It may also be said that there is relatively little public interest in the disclosure of internal discussions about whether to revise a single paragraph in (non-binding) guidance, addressing a technical question about who could act as QP in a particular situation for the purposes of a FOIA exemption. # The Tribunal does agree with Mr O’Hanlon, however, that maintaining public confidence in the Commissioner is not a valid argument for 44 See, for example, Bellamy v The Information Commissioner and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry EA/ 2005/0023 (4 April 2006) | 45 [2009] EWHC 164 (QB) 46 Supra , 47 See in this connection, Kessler v Information Commissioner and HM Commissioners for Revenue & Customs EA/2007/0043 and Kitchener v Information Commissioner and Derby City Council [2006] UKUT EA 2006 48 In contrast, for example, with the situation in Crawford v The Information Commissioner and Lincolnshire County Council EA/2011/0145 (16 June 2011), where the Commissioner accepted that there was an issue of considerable importance to the public in the local area 24 |withholding the requested information, as the ICO had argued: if the | communications in question revealed that the Commissioner had fallen short of expected standards, she would not be entitled to public confidence on a false prospectus. /9. There is one other factor which has troubled the Tribunal. This is that it appears that, during the 2015 appeal, the Commissioner suggested to the Trust that it | obtain a second QP opinion. The Tribunal has not seen the correspondence in which the suggestion was made but the Commissioner has not contradicted the assertion by the Trust in that appeal that it was. Indeed, Ms Kane, the Chief Executive, apparently said in her witness statement that the ICO had requested that she provide an opinion in addition to Ms Sexton’s. Mr O’Hanlon makes the _ point that the Commissioner’s intervention was shortly after he raised the validity of the original QP opinion. 80. In the Tribunal’s judgment, Mr O’Hanlon is right to be concerned about the , Commissioner’s apparent intervention. Since the Commissioner has an | inquisitorial function, it is perfectly proper for her to suggest to a public authority that the existing facts indicate that an exemption on which the authority has not relied might apply, and indeed to find that it does. Similarly, it is perfectly proper for her, in finding against an authority, to rely on arguments which the requester has not put. However, that is qualitatively different from suggesting that a public authority take a step which would, or at least might, lead to the availability of an exemption which was not otherwise available on existing facts. The Commissioner appears here to have suggested the creation of a new factual scenario rather than simply drawing conclusions from an existing scenario. When she did so, she knew that there was a question whether the initial QP opinion was valid and that the Tribunal might decide that it was not. 61. In the event, the 2015 Tribunal, although it accepted that the Director of Nursing was entitled to be the QP, had doubts as to whether her opinion was | reasonable. It did not need to decide the question because it held that the | second opinion, by the Chief Executive, was both valid and reasonable. That opinion would, presumably, not have been given but for the Commissioner’s intervention. It follows that, to put it at its lowest, her intervention might have been crucial in turning a victory for Mr O'Hanlon on the section 36 issue into a defeat. | a 82. It is not surprising that Mr O’Hanlon should think that, rather than adopting her usual disinterested role during the 2015 appeal - defending her decision with | appropriate robustness but with no stake in the outcome - the Commissioner was - entering the arena and, in his words, adopting a win at all costs approach. | | Whether or not this was the motivation, a fresh OP opinion could have diverted : | attention from the correctness of the Commissioner’s guidance. What Mr / O'Hanlon regards as the partisanship of the Commissioner no doubt encouraged | See para 49 | 25 L[ him in his belief that the Commissioner had no settled intention to revise her guidance when she told the 2015 Tribunal she did. | | 83. For all that, however, the Tribunal has decided that the Commissioner’s conduct | in this respect should not tip the public interest scales. There is no causative link | between the suggestion of a second QP opinion and the internal discussions in | December 2015 (and, to a limited extent, in May 2016) about a need to amend the | guidance. Those discussions would have taken place irrespective of whether the L | Trust had been encouraged to produce a second opinion: Mr O’Hanlon had a | raised the correctness of the guidance and that issue therefore needed to be | addressed. As Mr O’Hanlon acknowledged in his Reply, the statement of | intention to revise the guidance was only of marginal relevance to that appeal. | The Commissioner was not relying on it for the appeal. That is important because | _ the philosophy underpinning waiver is that a person should not be able to assert | LPP when she positively relies on having received particular legal advice. | - 84 Itis also fair to record that, at the hearing, Ms Gannon, on instructions, asked that | the Commissioner be allowed to make written representations on this issue if the Tribunal asked for representations on the jurisdiction question. It may be, / therefore, that the Commissioner could have said something casting a different | | light on her apparent intervention. | | | | 85. For these reasons, Mr O’Hanlon’s appeal is allowed to the extent of some of the | disputed information. However, the remainder of the information - including | that part in which Mr O'Hanlon was most interested (relating to deliberations about revision of the guidance) - must remain closed. The Commissioner did hold information about revision of the guidance. The decision is unanimous. | Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal | Date: 1 May 2018 Date Promulgated: 2 May 2018 26"

Notwithstanding this, the public authority is not required to take any steps as the Tribunal agrees that, on the balance of probabilities, the public authority does not hold relevant information further to that already provided. REASONS Background to the appeal 2. The Appellant made an information request to Suffolk County Council (“SCC”) on 18/12/2016. He was requesting information relating to communications between SCC, Waveney District Council (“WDC"") and Adnams ple about three planning applications relating to proposed works at the Swan Hotel in Victoria Street, Southwold. 3. SCC is the relevant highways authority, WDC is the relevant planning authority and Adnams plc was the planning applicant. WDC and Suffolk Coastal District Council work in partnership and have shared services arrangements. The Appellant owns property in Victoria Street and represents other residents of Victoria Street who oppose the planning application. He had particular concerns about the road safety issues connected with the proposed new access arrangements. The planning application became the subject of a judicial review application made by the Appellant in February 2017. 4. The Appellant's request was sent to SCC by email on 18/12/2016 (we noted that the Respondent’s decision notice incorrectly refers to the request being dated 8/12/2016) and was worded as follows: 2“I would like to see the following information in connection with Suffolk Highways consultation ref: SCC Ref: 570\CON\3761\16 and earlier related | consultations: | 1. Details of communications and meetings between any of the following parties: [third party company] (the applicant) or its agents, Suffolk County Council (the highways authority) and Waveney District Council (the planning : authority), in respect of the Victoria St. access, its dimensions and visibility | splays in connection with planning applications: DC/15/1016/FUL, | DC/16/2587/FUL and DC /16/3381/FUL and agreement reached to Justify the sub-standard access specification deemed acceptable for DC/16/3381/F UL. 2. Details of the road safety risk assessment carried out for the first consultation in respect access specification for DC/16/3381/FUL in relation to the traffic speeds and the forecast increase in traffic for Victoria St, and those parts of the conservation area affected by the diverted traffic flows. | 3. Details of the road safety risk assessment carried out in relation to the Swan carriage archway and the impact of the forecast 17% reduction of vehicle movements resulting from the Swan refurbishment scheme DC/16/2587/FUL and DC/16/3381/FUL. 4. Details (by reference to email correspondence or otherwise) of the further consultation request from Waveney District council and steps taken to provide a response in relation to DC/16/3381/FUL and (a) the applicant's Traffic Report and (b) my critique of it in the form of Comments on Traffic Tech Note.” 3. On 26/1/2017, SCC posted two CDs containing relevant information to the Appellant and explained that some information had been redacted on the basis that it was personal data. Those redactions are not in issue in this appeal. 6. On 6/2/17 the Appellant contacted SCC to say that he was dissatisfied with the response. He: (a) identified two areas where he considered the response to be incomplete and he also queried the entire redaction of one particular email; and (b) pointed out that his request for information relating to the road safety risk assessments had not been addressed at all. | SCC treated (a) as a new request for information and they conducted an internal review in relation to (b). . 7. On 7/3/2017, SCC informed the appellant of the outcome of their internal | review; that is, that there were no road safety risk assessments in connection with the relevant planning applications and that they did not hold an 7 unredacted copy of the email referred to above (that email was subsequently | discovered to be a “corrupted copy” of a photograph taken by the Appellant - |: | | | | an “uncorrupted version” was subsequently located and provided to the Appellant on 22/3/2017). They responded to his “new” request for | information and informed him that they did not hold any further relevant : information (the date of that response was not clear to us). 8. On 9/3/2017, the Appellant applied to the Respondent for a decision as to whether his request for information had been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. On 16/8/2017, the Respondent decided that SCC had provided its response outside the 20 working day time limit but had otherwise dealt with the request in accordance with the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (having decided, on the balance of probabilities, that SCC did not hold any further information falling within the scope of the request). __ The appeal grounds 9. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal can be summarised as follows: e The Respondent's interpretation of the request for information (as a request for external communications only between the two Councils and Adnams) was unjustifiably narrow. | | e The Respondent had incorrectly limited the scope of the request to information held at the time of the Respondent's decision, rather than at the time of the request (this, however, was clearly misconceived - see paragraph 48 of the decision notice). e Within the information provided there was clear evidence of two relevant emails having been sent by Adnams management to SCC, which had not been provided to the Appellant. e The Appellant’s request for sight of those emails should not have been treated as a new request. e Querying why the Respondent was satisfied that the missing emails had been deleted properly in accordance with SCC’s best practice. | The outcome sought by the Appellant was a revision of the Respondent's decision in order to: record that SCC had failed to respond adequately to the Appellant’s request for information; record that SCC had deliberately destroyed, altered or hid requested information; and to include some comments on the adequacy or otherwise of SCC’s data management policy relating to the retention/ detention of emails. 10. Both parties had consented to the matter being determined without a hearing and, after considering the bundle of evidence, we were satisfied that we could properly determine the issues without a hearing. | 4The law 11. The information that was requested clearly fell within the definition of “environmental information” within the meaning of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“the EIRs”). It is that disclosure regime, therefore, that applies to this appeal. , 12. The key provisions of the EIRs in relation to this appeal are: regulation 5 (duty to make available environmental information on request); regulation 11 (representations and reconsideration); and regulation 18 (enforcement and appeals provisions, which applies (with modifications) the enforcement and appeals provisions of the Freedom of information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) to the EIRs regime). | | 13. The provisions relating to the determination of EIR (and FOIA) appeals are set out in section 58 of FOIA. In relation to this appeal, it was our task to decide whether the Respondent's decision notice dated 16/8/2017 was in accordance with the law. If it was not, we were required to allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Respondent. If we decided otherwise, we were required to dismiss the appeal. We are empowered to review any finding of fact on which a decision notice is based. The relevant issues 14. The issues we had to decide were as follows: e What information potentially fell within the scope of the Appellant's request for information? | e Whether SCC dealt with the request for information in accordance with the EIRs; and e Whether SCC held further relevant information at the time of the request that it had unlawfully failed to disclose? The issue that we did not and could not decide was whether, as alleged by the Appellant, SCC had deliberately destroyed information to prevent it from being disclosed. Under regulation 19 of the EIRs, it is an offence for a person to destroy etc. any record held by a public authority to which a request for information has been made, with the intention of preventing its disclosure. _ That is not a matter that falls within our jurisdiction. The evidence | 15. The evidence before us was the paper evidence contained in the bundle of evidence (from pages 1 to 355 and the Appellant's supplementary submission dated 30/12/2017). | . The scope of the request 16. Our understanding of the scope of paragraph 1 of the request was that it was intended to catch information relating to communications/ meetings about the specified subject matter, which had taken place between (a) SCC and Adnams; 5(b) WDC and Adnams (if held by SCC); SCC and WDC; and SCC, WDC and , | Adnams. | 17. Given the inclusion of the words “.. between any of the following parties” (my emphasis), it did not in our view catch purely internal communications etc. between officers of SCC. In our judgement, that was the only way in which the request could be objectively read. 18. Some of the additional information sought by the Appellant in his email dated 6/2/2017 to SCC (page 195 of the bundle) did, therefore, in our view fall within the scope of paragraph 1 of the original request. Given our conclusion below about the origins of the Adnams “footers”, this included some of the information referred to in bullet 1 (i.e. any correspondence that emanated from Adnams) and all of the information in bullet 3. The information referred to in bullet 2 would have fallen within the scope of the original request to the extent that it included any correspondence between the parties referred to above (other than purely internal correspondence within SCC relating to the site meeting on 17/5/2016). | Was the request for information dealt with in accordance with the EIRs? 19. It follows from paragraphs 16-18 above that SCC was in breach of the EIRs by treating all of the first part of the Appellant’s email of 6/2/2017 as a new request for information. They should instead have reconsidered their original response in accordance with regulation 11 of the EIRs. 20. The fact that SCC provided its response to the original request for information outside the 20 working day deadline specified in regulation 5(2) of the EIRs was not in issue. Did SCC hold further relevant information at the time of the request that it had unlawfully failed to disclose? | Information allegedly missing from File 16 | 21. File 16 (pages 26-32 of the bundle of evidence) is one of the files of information that SCC provided to the Appellant. It is comprised of copies of email correspondence passing primarily between personnel in the Development Management division of SCC and Adnams architect, Simon Merrett, during the period 25/4/16 to 16/5/16 inclusive. The emails are about the proposed access details relating to the Swan Hotel. 22. On page 27 of the bundle is a copy of an email dated 13/5/2016 which was sent by Deborah Cadman, the Chief Executive Officer of SCC, to Geoff Dobson, the Director of Resource Management at SCC. The words that appear in the subject heading of her emails are: “Fwd: Swan Hotel, Southwold - Road.” Ms Cadman’s name does not appear on any of the earlier emails in that file, either as a recipient or as a copyee. On page 32 of the bundle is a copy of part of an_ email from Karen Hester, Chief Operating Officer of Adnams. The only part of 6the email that appears is what the Appellant refers to as the “footer”; that is, | Ms Hester's signature block, some corporate information about Adnams and some standard disclaimer wording. It is not apparent when that email was sent ~ nor to whom, nor when that information was deleted. | The events of 30/11/2016 | | 23. The Appellant asserts that at 08:00 on 30/11/2016, having formed the view that site work had commenced at the Swan Hotel before the discharge of | planning conditions, he took a photograph of the site and sent it to his own tablet device. At 09:30 on the same day, he sent an email (a copy of which is at page 36 of the bundle of evidence) with a copy of the photograph to relevant officers in WDC and East Suffolk District Council. That email is from now on referred to as “EM301116”. He then sent the same photograph, with a short email message (a copy of which is at page 269 of the bundle) to Andy Wood of Adnams plc. He denies sending EM301116 to anyone at SCC. | Information allegedly missing from File 26 24. File 26 (pages 34-39 of the bundle of evidence) is another file of information that SCC provided to the Appellant. File 26 includes (at page 35 of the bundle) a copy of an email dated 2/12/2016 and sent at 14:04 from Zoe Crosby, Executive Assistant to Ms Cadman, to Sue Roper of SCC. The words that appear in the subject heading of that email are “FW: DC/16/3381/FUL:” and | the email refers to “the email below” (on page 36), which is a forwarded email and is clearly EM301116 and the photograph to which that emails refers. On page 39 of file 26 is a copy of part of an email from Adnams. Again, only the “footer” of the email appears but this time the details of the individual Adnams sender do not appear. Again, it is not apparent when the email was sent nor to whom, nor when that information was deleted. Our findings of fact in relation to the missing information from Files 16 and 26 25. We made the following findings of fact: e Email correspondence was sent by or on behalf of Karen Hester, Chief Operating Officer of Adnams, to Deborah Cadman, Chief Executive Officer of SCC, or one of her team in May 2016 and it was that correspondence that triggered Deborah Cadman’s email of 13/5/2016 to Geoff Dobson. | e The Appellant did not at any time send EM301116 or the photograph to | which it refers to SCC. e Someone from Adnams forwarded EM301116 and the photograph to which it refers by email to Deborah Cadman or one of her team at some point after 09:30 on 30/11/2016 and before 14:04 on 2/12/2016. It was | that email correspondence that triggered Zoe Crosby’s email of _ 2/12/2016 to Sue Roper. | |e The missing parts of the Adnams emails referred to above were no longer held by SCC when the Appellant's request for information was | received by SCC on 18/12/2016. 26. The evidence before us supported the Appellant’s account about to whom he : sent EM301116 and the photograph. It was clear that the Respondent had in | fact confused the email addresses of officers in SCC with those in WDC and | Sussex Coastal District Council. In our judgement, there is no other reasonable | explanation than as described above for the appearance of the Adnams’ | “footers” in Files 16 and 26. | | 27. The EIRs do not impose an obligation on a public authority to keep | information (although a public authority is under a duty to comply with the Code of practice issued under section 46 of FOIA and must keep information where there is a legal requirement to do so). As a matter of law, the duties imposed by the EIRs only apply to information held at the time that a request for information is received. 28. Despite the failure of SCC to respond to the request for information within the statutory deadline, SCC had provided a substantial amount of information following the Appellant’s original request and had, in our judgement, approached the task in a professional and diligent manner. _ 29. After reviewing the correspondence at pages 249, 275, 332, 345 and 352 of the bundle of evidence and the note at 355 of the bundle, we were satisfied that the Respondent properly and thoroughly investigated the adequacy of the search conducted by SCC. We were also satisfied from the responses of SCC at pages 290, 341, 349 and 354 of the bundle that they had carried out a reasonable search and that the scope of their search and the search terms used were appropriate and sufficient to capture any further relevant information that was held at the time of the request. It was, in our view, plausible that the missing parts of the emails in question had been deleted prior to the receipt of the Appellant’s request. The Respondent applied the correct legal test when | deciding the issue on the balance of probabilities and we agreed with the Respondent's conclusion in that respect. Our decision 30. The Respondent's decision notice should also have stated that SCC was in | breach of the EIRs by treating the information referred to in the bullet points within the Appellant’s email dated 6/2/2017 to SCC (other than information contained in purely internal correspondence between officers of SCC) as a new request for information, rather than a request for reconsideration under regulation 11. It was otherwise in accordance with the law. The appeal is, | therefore, allowed to that extent and the Tribunal substitutes the decision | notice set out in paragraph 1 above in place of the Respondent's decision — notice dated 16/8/2017. 8Date Promulgated: | 26 February 2018 | Karen Booth Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 25 February 2018 9z : | | | i | i | | | | , }"
"901","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0099 Before Judge David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Members Andrew Whetnall and Roger Creedon Between Edward Williams Appellant and The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) Respondent Mr. Williams appeared in person. The ICO did not appear but made written submissionsDecision and Reasons The Tribunal finds that, at the material time, London Councils held the requested information for the purposes of s.3(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, 2000. This appeal is therefore allowed. The Tribunal substitutes for the decision of the ICO set out in her Decision Notice (“the DN”) an order that London Councils, within thirty – five days of the publication of this Decision, comply with FOIA s.1(1)(b), subject to s.2(2). 1. Motorists who receive civil penalty charges for parking and other civil traffic contraventions have a right of appeal to an Environment and Traffic Adjudicator, (“the adjudicator”) enacted, as regards Greater London, in the Road Traffic Act, 1991, as amended and Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act, 2004. 2. London Councils (“LC”) is a public authority representing the Greater London boroughs. It is subject to FOIA by virtue of Schedule 1. Pursuant to s.73 of the RTA 1991, s. 81 of the TMA 2004 and regulation 15 of the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations, 2007/3483, (“the 2007 regulations”) it formed a joint committee with Transport for London, to appoint adjudicators and provide administrative support and facilities. 3. That support service is provided by London Tribunals (“LT”), formerly the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service (“PATAS”), which is, in effect, a department within LC. The joint committee is an “enforcement authority” with the functions specified in s.81 TMA 2004. 4. Adjudicators in Greater London are appointed for a fixed five – year term by the enforcement authority with the approval of the Lord Chancellor on terms decided by that authority. They are remunerated by the enforcement authority, which meets all the costs of the service (see Reg. 15 of the 2007 regulations). They may be dismissed by that authority, only with the consent of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. (TMA s.81(3) and (4)).. 5. Adjudicators are required to make an annual report to the enforcement authority (TMA s.81(5)(a)) on matters which it determines. 6. In summary, adjudicators are appointed to their office by the enforcement authority. Their appointment or dismissal require external judicial sanction. They are accountable to the enforcement authority for the general conduct of their office but not, of course, for the judicial decisions that they make or any justification of such decisions. Notwithstanding their employed status, at least for tax purposes, they are plainly independent of the enforcement authority, here LC. Their position is closely aligned to that of judges, who are appointed by the Ministry of Justice, pay tax and National Insurance by the PAYE system but are unquestionably independent officeholders. 7. That said, their employment status is not critical to the result of this appeal because it cannot determine the question whether the requested information held by LT is held exclusively on behalf of the adjudicators. 8. On 11th. November, 2016 Mr. Williams addressed the following request to LC – “Please provide a list of all training manuals, guidance, advisory circulars, etc. issued to parking adjudicators sitting in London”. There is, in our view, no material difference here between a request for a list and a request for the documents themselves, given the grounds for LC’s refusal. 9. LC replied on 18th. November, 2016 that LT was not a public authority under FOIA. That is undoubtedly true. It is not a public authority at all but part of LC, which is. It also treated the request as though it had been addressed to an adjudicator, which was not the case. It stated that the requested information was on its website but, in support of that claim, referred to information outside the scope of the request. 10. When Mr. Williams requested an internal review, LC gave a different answer, namely that LT did not hold the requested information for the purpose of FOIAs.3(2) because it held it on behalf of the adjudicators. This is the case that LC presented to the ICO and which the ICO accepted in her DN. LC appeared to accept, at the stage of the internal review, that, if LT held the information under s.3(2), then the information was held by LC. 11. Mr. Williams complained to the ICO. 12. Responding to questions raised by the ICO in her investigation, LC, in a letter dated 20th. April, 2017, made the following points - (i) The adjudicators have judicial status and are not subject to FOIA. (ii) Information held by LT is not subject to FOIA. (iii) In 2011 PATAS had been listed by the Ministry of Justice for possible inclusion in a longer list of public authorities to be subject to FOIA but no such change was enacted. (iv) “LT is the collective name for the two tribunals and the support service provided by (“LC”)” (v) “ . . . the information requested is held on (the adjudicators’) behalf on systems provided by LC at LT.” 13. The ICO accepted the argument set out at §§10 and 12(v) above and dismissed the complaint. Her Response to the Grounds of Appeal simply confirmed that acceptance. 14. Mr. Williams’ Grounds of Appeal were succinct. He argued that LC held the requested information and was a public authority for the purposes of Schedule 1. He included a quotation from a statement on LT’s website that – “. . . .adjudicators are exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 2000, as are documents created by the administrative staff of London Tribunals” (our emphasis)Our Findings 15. If LC is right, the public has no right of access to any guidance, practice manual or circular provided to adjudicators to assist them in their conduct of appeals because the only public authority which holds and is involved in the creation or distribution of such documents holds them on behalf of individuals who are not public authorities. Given that the requested material is of a general character and does not involve the judicial business of the adjudicators, namely their individual decisions, and having regard to the legitimate public interest in knowing how, in general terms, adjudicators are advised and trained in the performance of their role, such an immunity from disclosure would be very odd. 16. We were not shown examples of the requested material, a strange omission from the ICO’s evidence and, presumably, her investigation. We have, however, some general picture of the kind of material likely to be involved, derived from our own work as experienced judge and panel members, who receive guidance and assistance from a central authority, whether the court or the tribunal service. The production of such material is a part of the support function provided, in the case of adjudicators, by LT. Much of it may deal with routine issues involved in the daily running of the tribunals. Some may offer advice as to the treatment of appellants and witnesses or questions of disability and diversity. There may be instructions as to the use of judicial information technology. Some, we suppose, will be comments on relevant current legal issues. None of it will trespass on the judicial independence of the adjudicators. 17. The authorship of such material is irrelevant. More important is its origin, which is likely to be LT, as may be implied by the extract quoted at §13. If not the originator, LT is almost certainly the distributor to adjudicators of the requested material. LC clearly accepts that LT controls copies of such material, whether in hard copy or electronic (see §11(5)). Its case is that it does so on the adjudicators’ behalf.18. Just like judges in the court and tribunal systems, adjudicators must receive copies of the requested material individually, whether in hard copy or, more probably, electronically. Of course, they are not public authorities subject to FOIA and nobody has requested disclosure of their copies of the requested material, whether paper or computer file. 19. This request was made to LC so the judicial status of the adjudicators is quite irrelevant to the determination of this appeal. The principal issue is the purpose for which LT holds this information “on systems provided by LC” ( §11(v)). 20. LT is not a public authority, not subject to FOIA nor the target of the request for information. We can do no better than quote LC’s answer to the ICO - “LT is the collective name for the two tribunals and the support service provided by (“LC”)”. It is accurately described by Mr. Williams as a “function of LC”. LC’s statement that “information held by LT and the LT support service is not subject to the FOIA” ignores the fact that LT is part of LC which is certainly subject to FOIA. 21. The enforcement authority for Greater London is the joint committee formed by LC jointly with TfL (Reg. 15 of the 2007 regulations). Both are Schedule 1 public authorities. Information held by the support service, LT, is held by LC and probably, though immaterial to this appeal, also by TfL. The government’s decision, if there was a decision, not to include PATAS in FOIA Schedule 1 has, therefore, no bearing on this appeal. LC has evidently assumed responsibility for the provision of the support service required by the enforcement authority. The nature of any arrangement with TfL in relation to that provision is no concern of the Tribunal. 22. Since possession of the information by LT is possession by LC, the critical question is the purpose or purposes for which LT holds the requested information. If the purpose, or one of the purposes, is the performance of its delegated functions under TMA s.81, then the appeal succeeds.23. The answer seems perfectly clear. Holding, possibly creating and distributing the requested information to adjudicators represents a significant part of its support function, just like that of the Liverpool Office of the General Regulatory Chamber of the Tribunal Service as regards judges dealing with information rights or circuit offices and other MoJ services supporting the full and part – time judiciary. It holds such information because any support service must have access to this type of information provided to adjudicators, not least so as to deal with questions and requests for copies and explanations – an example, perhaps, of information held for the purposes both of LT and of the adjudicators. Such information is held “otherwise than on behalf of another person”, because it is held also on behalf of LT. see University of Newcastle upon Tyne v Information Commissioner & BUAV [2011] 2 Info LR 54. 24. If LC were right in asserting that LT held the requested information exclusively on behalf of the adjudicators, it would follow that, at any time, the adjudicators could require LT to deliver up to them all such information which it held in any form, deleting any electronic back – up copies. That corollary demonstrates that LC’s proposition is unsustainable. 25. Our finding on this issue does not in any way prejudice the judicial independence of the adjudicators because it does not affect the making of individual decisions. Nobody could sensibly suggest that publication of the Judicial College Guidance on Diversity or of Sentencing Guidelines threatens the independence of judges. The request was for “a list of all training manuals, guidance, advisory circulars etc.”, not for sensitive communications between one judge(adjudicator) and another or assessments of a pending appeal. A claim that the Judicial College Personal Injury Guidelines were held by the Judicial College, exclusively on behalf of judges to whom they were communicated would be met by those judges with incredulity. 26. If the preceding paragraphs have featured a degree of supposition, that is because the ICO produced no examples of the potentially responsive material which LT held.That was unhelpful. We do not consider, however, that its absence prevents us from making a proper determination of the issues raised in this appeal. 27. For these reasons we allow this appeal. Within thirty – five days LC must either disclose this information or, if it claims that s.2(2) applies, provide a response accordingly. The information can be provided, either in the form of the specified list or by disclosure of the documents described in the request. 28. This is a majority decision. The opinion of Mr. Whetnall, the dissenting member accompanies it. Signed David Farrer QC, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 4th. February, 2018 Promulgated: 9th. March, 2018"
"96","Substantive Refusal","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Information rights Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 Heard at Field House On 8 September 2017 Before JUDGE PETER LANE ALISON LOWTON NIGEL WATSON Between GABRIEL WEBBER Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and THE CABINET OFFICE Second Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: In Person For the First Respondent: No appearance or representation © CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 For the Second Respondent: Mr Robin Hopkins, Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department DECISION AND REASONS Introduction 1. This appeal concerns the grant of a Public Duties Cost Allowance (PDCA) for Mr Nick Clegg, who was Deputy Prime Minister in the Coalition Government from 2010 to 2015. On 12 July 2016, the appellant made the following request to the Cabinet Office:- “I see from your latest accounts that the PDCA is now available to Nick Clegg. Please provide me with an electronic copy of all recorded information you hold regarding Nick Clegg’s eligibility for this allowance, except (i) details of his claims, and (ii) the total amount he has claimed. This will no doubt include information on how he came to be eligible, who proposed this, his response, and so on”. 2. The Information Commissioner subsequently found that the Cabinet Office contravened its obligation under section 10 of Freedom of Information Act 2000 (time for compliance), by failing to provide a response to the appellant within a reasonable time. The Information Commissioner decided, however, that the Cabinet Office had been entitled to refuse to disclose the information, on the basis that the information fell within the scope of section 35 (1)(a) of FOIA and that the public interest in withholding the information outweighed the public interest in its disclosure. The appellant appealed against that decision. 3. Section 35(1)(a) provides as follows: “35(1) Information held by a government department or by the Welsh Assembly Government is exempt information if it relates to – (a) the formulation or development of government policy.” 4. The Cabinet Office’s initial refusal was communicated to the appellant on 22 September 2016. A decision on internal review, which upheld the earlier decision, was communicated to the appellant on 20 October 2016. 5. On 9 September 2016, the following information was published, by way of a written parliamentary question and answer:- 2Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 “Question: to ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, what arrangements have been made for the process of approval of expenses claims submitted by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam under the Public Duties Cost Allowance” Answer: the purpose of the Public Duties Cost Allowance is to assist former Prime Ministers with the costs of continuing to fulfil duties associated with their previous position in public life. Exceptionally, the then Prime Minister agreed that the former Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt.Hon. Member for Sheffield Hallam, should be able to have access to the allowance to recognise the special position he held in the Coalition Government. Other former Deputy Prime Ministers are not eligible for the allowance. The allowance is set at a maximum limit of £115,000 per annum. The amounts paid are a reimbursement of expenses, accounted for in the published Cabinet Office Annual Reports and Accounts. The former Deputy Prime Minister is eligible for the allowance from the date of leaving ministerial office for the duration of this Parliament.” Scope 6. The appellant informed the Cabinet Office that his request was confined to information about Mr Clegg’s eligibility for the PDCA, not details of Mr Clegg’s actual claims. Partly as a result of this, the Cabinet Office contended that certain elements of the withheld information are outside the scope of the appellant’s request. 7. Having examined the information, the Tribunal agrees with the Cabinet Office on this issue of scope. Our reasoning is given in the closed annex to this decision. The submissions 8. So far as concerns the information which is within the scope of the appellant’s request, the Cabinet Office’s position, as articulated by Mr Hopkins both in writing and at the hearing, is that the balance of the public interest lies in withholding the information. Mr Hopkins contends that the disputed information comprises discussions of policy options, ideas and suggestions. There are also exchanges of views about how the policy area could be approached, both in respect to Mr Clegg and more broadly. Open discussions of policy options are said to be “evident on every page. This point is pivotal to this appeal”. 9. According to Mr Hopkins, the disputed information is also replete with “genuinely free and frank discussions about this issue. This includes frank commentary…. as well as genuinely open discussions of policy options (evident throughout the disputed information).” 10. Mr Hopkins submitted that, at the time of the appellant’s request, government policy about the PDCA remained in a state of development. Referring to the witness evidence of Ms Sharon Carter of the Cabinet Office (to which we shall return in due course), Mr Hopkins submitted that the PDCA remains in a state 3Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 of development and that, although decisions have been made about the granting of the PDCA to Mr Clegg, the broad policy question of how the PDCA should operate in the future, remains a live one, and was such at all material times. Policy on how the PDCA should operate remains in a state of formulation. 11. In this regard, Mr Hopkins relied on OGC v IC and the Attorney General [2008] EWHC 744(Admin), where at [100], we find the following:- “… disclosure of discussions of policy options, whilst policy is in the process of formulation, is highly unlikely to be in the public interest, unless for example, it would expose wrongdoing within government. Ministers and officials are entitled to time and space, in some instances, to considerable time and space, to hammer out policy by exploring safe and radical options alike without the threat of lurid headlines depicting that which has been merely broached as agreed policy”. 12. The public interest in withholding the information is, therefore, very high, in Mr Hopkins’ submission. 13. Mr Hopkins submitted that the appellant’s attempt to portray the public interest in favour of disclosure as outweighing the factors Mr Hopkins had described, was flawed. The appellant had been unable to produce anything to show that there had been significant public interest in the issue of Mr Clegg and the PDCA. 14. Mr Hopkins said that the Cabinet Office had, in fact, already made public a good deal of information as to how Mr Clegg came to be granted the PDCA. In addition to the Parliamentary Question and Answer referred to above, a slightly later Q&A (12 September 2016) had given further details about the PDCA. Furthermore, the Cabinet Office had provided the appellant with the following:- “The Deputy Prime Minister requested the allowance for a limited period, reflecting the unique nature of the role he held in the Coalition Government. The then Prime Minister agreed. Mr Clegg is eligible for the allowance from the date of leaving ministerial office for the duration of this Parliament”. 15. Thus, according to Mr Hopkins, revealing the disputed information “would make little or no incremental contribution” to public debate of Mr Clegg and the PDCA. 16. The appellant took issue with the Cabinet Office’s reasons (in effect, adopted by the Information Commissioner) for concluding that the balance of the public interest lay in favour of withholding the information. In the context of the present case, the appellant considered that use of the expressions “detriment” and “chilling effects” was vague, intangible and insufficiently precise to meet the threshold set by Department of Health v Lewis [2015] UKUT 0159 (AAC). The appellant laid emphasis on the Civil Service Code, whereby civil servants 4Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 “must provide information and advice, including advice to ministers, on the basis of the evidence, and accurately present the options and facts… you must not ignore inconvenient facts or relevant considerations when providing advice and making decisions”. Given that it is, accordingly, every civil servant’s professional duty to provide proper advice to Ministers, they must be, according to the appellant, “robust enough to continue providing such advice whatever the consequences of this particular disclosure”. 17. The appellant submitted that the history of the PDCA, was, in effect, problematic. It had been introduced in 1991, by the then Prime Minister, without parliamentary involvement. It was only when the appellant studied the accounts released by the Cabinet Office that it became apparent the PDCA had been extended to include Mr Clegg. Whether or not disclosure of the information would be likely to reveal reprehensible conduct, the appellant submitted that there was a strong public interest in shining a light into this area. In his words, “handouts to ex-politicians” should receive proper public scrutiny. “Sunlight” the appellant said, “is the best disinfectant”. Witness evidence 18. We heard evidence from Ms Sharon Carter. She is currently employed in the Cabinet Office as Head of the Propriety and Ethics Team, in which capacity she is responsible for advising Departments and others on the application of the Civil Service Code, the Ministerial Code, and the Special Advisor Code of Conduct, as well as a range of related policy issues. 19. Ms Carter confirmed that the PDCA had been introduced in 1991. The total allowance which could be claimed by each former Prime Minister was linked to the ceiling of the centralised arrangements for payment of staff and secretarial support for MPs with London constituencies. The allowance exists to reimburse former Prime Ministers for the expenses they incur in continuing to fulfil public duties. Such expenses might include the cost associated with overseas visits, for example, for the funeral for a former leader, public appearances associated with their former role, for example, at the Cenotaph ceremony, or the costs of running an office (given that the former Prime Ministers continue to receive significant levels of correspondence stemming directly from their time in that office). Payments are made only to meet the actual costs of continuing to fulfil public duties. 20. Ms Carter said that, in addition to the allowance paid, former Prime Ministers are entitled to claim a pension allowance to contribute towards their staff pension costs. This pension allowance is limited to a maximum of ten per cent of staff salary costs. 5Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 21. The amounts claimed by former Prime Ministers are published annually in the Cabinet Office annual reports and accounts. The Cabinet Office has also placed copy of the guidance for the payment of the PDCA in the libraries of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 22. As far as Mr Clegg is concerned, Ms Carter said: “7. In 2015, following the general election, the allowance was extended for a period of five years to Nick Clegg , the former Deputy Prime Minister in the Coalition Government, to help with some of the essential costs and secretariat support associated with being in such a senior position in public life. As PDCA had only been payable since 1991, there had been no previous coalition governments, and no comparable predecessors to Mr Clegg”. 23. Having dealt with issues of this scope of the request, (as to which, see above) and personal data such as contact details, Ms Carter said that the remainder of the request and information fell within the exemption in section 35(1)(a). Her reasoning was as follows:- “13 …It concerns the development of policy in the area of PDCA and eligibility for PDCA, which was in progress at the time the information was created, and was ongoing at the time of the request. It is clear from the nature and content of the withheld information that this policy issue was in a state of development. I can also confirm that policy on PDCA remains actively under review at the time of this witness statement. 14. The role of Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2015 was unique. Since the inception of PDCA in 1991, there have been no other coalition governments and no other Deputy Prime Ministers who are also the leaders of the junior party in a coalition government. The nearest corollary in British political history would be Clement Atlee in the wartime Coalition Government, who was Deputy Prime Minister and also leader of the junior party in the coalition. In his role as Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Clegg supported the Prime Minister in the oversight of the full range of government policy and initiatives. 15. The consideration and extension of PDCA to Mr Clegg recognised this unique position and the ongoing costs associated with his former responsibilities. As would be expected, there was some discussion about how and in what terms this extension should be granted, and the information and scope of the request sets out very clearly the policy development process in this area. 16. The release of this information relating to policy development in this area would have a detrimental effect on the ability of the Prime Minister and senior officials to have a free and frank discussion and exchange of views about the eligibility of individuals for, and the extent of PDCA. There must be a space within which officials are able to discuss their views on the emerging policy options freely and frankly so as to provide the Prime Minister with the most effective and comprehensive advice. Government Ministers, including the Prime Minister, are rightly answerable for the decisions they take, not for the options 6Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 they consider or the other influences on the policy formulation process. The disclosure of information about these considerations and discussions would invite judgments about the content of those considerations, the options considered, the opinions held by different officials, and would introduce a premature scrutiny of the policy options considered in this process. Ultimately, this would be corrosive of parliamentary democracy since it would hold ministers and their advisors accountable for the discussion rather than the decision. 17. I recognise that there is a general public interest in openness of government and acknowledge that transparency may contribute to greater public understanding of and participation in public affairs. I also understand that there is a public interest in understanding how the government develops policies, including those in relation to areas such as the payment of PDCA. I also recognise the specific public interest in understanding how decisions on allowances payable to public figures are made. When considering the balance of the public interest in this case, I take into account the timing of the request, which was just over a year after the creation of the information and scope of the request, and while policy development in this area was still ongoing. 18. Good government depends on good decision-making and this needs to be based on the best advice available and a full consideration of all the options without fear of premature disclosure. There is of course a place for public participation in the policy making process, and for public debate of policy options. However, it is not in the best interests of policy formulation, and therefore not in the public interest, that every stage of the policy making process should be made accountable via exposure to public scrutiny. 19. The candour which is evident in the e-mail chains demonstrates the frank and open discussion of the various policy options in this case. Releasing this information would damage the safe space necessary for the most effective development of policy. Officials and minister should be able to consider and advise on all options without considering whether those discussions, rather than the final decision, are held accountable. 20. The Government recognised the interest in this extension of PDCA, and was aware of the need to account for this novel payment. That is why the payment of the allowance was published, with a note, in the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts.” 24. Cross-examined by the appellant, Ms Carter said that disclosure at the time when a policy process was live would discourage discourse amongst officials and ministers; it would inhibit a proper exchange of views. Disclosure of discussions relating to emerging policy could “skew” subsequent discussions on the matter. 25. Ms Carter confirmed that she and her fellow civil servants would comply with the Civil Service Code, regardless of the decision that the Tribunal might take. Disclosure, however, might “unconsciously affect the thinking” of officials. 7Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 26. In re-examination by Mr Hopkins, Ms Carter said that, until 2015, details of the PDCA and its recipients were made available only through Parliamentary Questions, if any. In 2015, the Cabinet Office began to publish information in its accounts. Ms Carter considered that there had been very limited public interest in the PDCA and little interest in the matter relating to Mr Clegg. The press reports set out at pages 63 and 68 of the bundle were the only ones on the issue of Mr Clegg, so far as she was aware. In an answer to a question from the Tribunal, Ms Carter said that it would be difficult to disentangle the information relating to the decision to award the PDCA to Mr Clegg from wider policy discussions. In any event, the basis upon which Mr Clegg received the award would be relevant to future decisions. Closed session 27. The Tribunal then went into closed session. Ms Carter explained how the policy on the future operation of the PDCA was actively being worked on and considered in July 2016. She referred to a draft policy paper, prepared in that month. The Tribunal asked to inspect that paper. The Cabinet Office complied. That document was made subject to a rule 14 direction that it be considered on a closed basis only. 28. Ms Carter and Mr Hopkins then took the Tribunal through the withheld information. They highlighted the information that they said comprised frank and candid exchanges of views and the information that discussed policy considerations that were already being worked on, including in July 2016. Discussion 29. The Tribunal agrees with the Cabinet Office and the Information Commissioner that, depending on the circumstances, disclosing information about government policies that are still being formulated is likely to result in damage to the public administration of affairs. We accept what Ms Carter had to say on this issue, as well as Mr Hopkins’ submissions thereon. The fact that civil servants are required by their Code to provide full and frank advice to Ministers is, with respect to the appellant, not an answer to this point. Public officials may well change their behaviour, in unconscious ways, or else adopt forms of discourse, which are “safer” but less efficient, particularly in times of rapid interplay of ideas. 30. This is the case with the e-mail chains, referred to in paragraph 19 of Ms Carter’s witness statement (see above). Notwithstanding what we say below, the release of these e-mails, comprising initial exchanges between officials at the beginning 8Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 of the policy process, would, we find, inflict harm on the very interests which is it is the purpose of section 35(1)(a) to protect. Conversely, given what is in the public domain and what we are about to say, releasing the emails would add little or nothing of actual significance to public debate on the extension of the PDCA to Mr Clegg. 31. Mr Hopkins submitted that it was, in practice, not possible to sever the relevant information relating to Mr Clegg from the totality of the disclosed information. With some exceptions, however, as identified in the Closed Annex, we consider that the other material within the scope of the request can be severed from the wider issue of the PDCA itself and whether, and if so, how, it should continue to operate. 32. We turn to the issue of whether this severable material ought to be withheld because it concerns government policy, which is still being worked upon. 33. An analogy may be helpful at this point. It is obvious that the Government will always keep under review the issue of taxation. The fact that Value Added Tax, for example, may change from time to time, both as to its rates and exemptions, cannot, in the Tribunal’s view, be used to invoke section 35(1)(a), so as to withhold information about a particular policy decision in the VAT field, such as a change in rate, which has already crystallised. 34. By the same token, the fact that policy on the PDCA as a whole was being considered at or around the time of the refusal to disclose the requested information to the appellant, is not a valid reason for refusing to comply with the appellant’s request, concerning Mr Clegg. 35. The appellant wanted to know how it was that Mr Clegg was brought within the terms of the PDCA. Plainly, by the time of the refusal the policy decision to include him had been taken. 36. Ms Carter contended that, in the future, issues would be likely to arise as to whether other deputy Prime Ministers or other figures should receive the PDCA. As a result, she suggested that the policy that had led to the decision to pay Mr Clegg the allowance was to be regarded as still in a state of development. 37. We respectfully disagree. The decision to include Mr Clegg is as historical as the decision to pay the allowance to previous Prime Ministers. The fact that it may serve as a precedent, in the light of which other, future decisions may be made, is nothing to the point. 38. Accordingly, we find that the public interest in favour of withholding the material, which is severable and is not the email material mentioned in paragraph 32 above, is much weaker than the Cabinet Office contend. It relates 9Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 to a separate policy decision, to pay Mr Clegg the PDCA for a limited period of time, which had been taken before the appellant made his request. 39. We next consider the issue of the public interest in favour of disclosure. We have taken account of the Cabinet Office’s submission that a significant amount of information relating to the decision to pay Mr Clegg the allowance is in the public domain. We also note the limited nature of the press coverage, following the appellant’s discovery of the announcement relating to Mr Clegg in the Cabinet Office’s accounts. 40. We agree with the appellant that there is, nevertheless, a significant public interest in shedding light on the formulation of the policy that resulted in the decision to pay Mr Clegg the allowance. As the appellant says, the PDCA emerged in 1991 as a result of a prime ministerial decision, lacking any parliamentary involvement. There is clearly a strong public interest in knowing why decisions are taken to pay significant sums of public money to fund the activities of former Prime Ministers. The decision to extend the PDCA to include a Deputy Prime Minister is subject to at least the same degree of legitimate interest, if not more. 41. We agree with the appellant that this public interest is not materially diminished, if the withheld material were to reveal nothing problematic in terms of official and ministerial decision making. On the contrary, one of the purposes of FOIA is to encourage good decision-making in official circles and thereby to increase public confidence in decisions taken on its behalf. Decision 42. We have decided to allow the appeal to the following extent. The information specified in the Closed Annex as required to be disclosed shall be disclosed by the Cabinet Office, not later than 42 days from the date of this decision. 43. The information to be disclosed concerns the crystallised policy to pay Mr Clegg the allowance. It does not include information that, upon analysis, is about the policy concerning the entire PDCA system. That policy remains under review and has not crystallised. The public interest in withholding information concerning it is stronger than the public interest in its disclosure. 44. The information to be disclosed also does not include the e-mail exchanges, referred to at paragraph 30 above, comprising initial thoughts and comments of officials. Insofar as they may be said to be within scope, the public interest in their disclosure is significantly outweighed by the public interest in enabling officials to have private space to converse freely, in seeking to ascertain what they are being asked or required to do. 10Appeal Number: EA/2017/0093 45. The Closed Annex explains these matters in more detail, as well as why certain information in the Closed Bundle is outside the scope of the request and/or concerns personal details, such as officials’ e-mail addresses.

The Crown Prosecution Service is to take the following steps: disclose to the Appellant the requested information in the revised redacted form we have identified in the confidential annexe to this Decision. The redactions we have directed are those in respect of which we find section 40 (2) FOIA to be engaged. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant made a request to the Crown Prosecution Service on 24 August 2015, asking for a copy of a letter sent by David Cameron MP to the Attorney General about one of Mr Cameron’s constituents. The letter related to the investigation of an alleged criminal offence. 4. The Appellant also asked for a copy of the Attorney General’s reply, or a draft thereof if none was sent. 5. The CPS originally refused to confirm or deny whether it held the information requested in reliance upon s. 40 (5) FOIA. Subsequently, it agreed to release the requested information after it had been redacted in reliance upon s. 40 (2) FOIA, as the correspondence contained personal data. The letter from Mr Cameron was disclosed with nearly all of it redacted. The letter from the Attorney General was also disclosed, redacted in part. 6. The Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50605198 on 1 November 2016, upholding the CPS’s decision. The Decision Notice concluded that (i) the withheld information constituted personal data; (ii) the withheld information constituted sensitive personal data because it relates to the alleged commission of a criminal offence; (iii) disclosure of the requested information would be unfair and breach the first data protection principle. Appeal to the Tribunal | 7. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 4 November 2016 seeks the release of | information which has been redacted in the version of Mr Cameron’s letter released | by the CPS. He maintains that he is not seeking the disclosure of sensitive personal | information but that there is a public interest in knowing whether Mr Cameron sought | to question a pending prosecution. The grounds of appeal do not challenge the | redactions contained in the disclosed version of the Attorney General’s reply. | 8. The Respondent’s Response dated 5 December 2016 maintained the analysis as | set out in the Decision Notice. In responding to the Appellant’s grounds of appeal, it is submitted that it is not possible to redact the letter so as to remove all third partypersonal data because to do so would render it meaningless. It is further submitted that the conditions in schedule 3 DPA for the processing of sensitive personal data are not met. 9. The Appellant's Reply dated 6 December 2016 takes issue with the Respondent’s Response in not accepting that the entirety of Mr Cameron’s letter constitutes sensitive personal data. 10. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 63 pages. including submissions made by both parties, for which we were grateful. The Tribunal also had before it a closed bundle comprising the withheld information. The Law ‘Ii. The duty of a public authority to disclose requested information is set out in s.1 (1) of FOIA. The exemptions to this duty are referred to in section 2 (2) as follows: “In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section I (1) (b) does not apply if or to the extent that — (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the | exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 12. The category of exemption relied upon under FOIA in this case is s. 40 (2) FOIA. Where engaged, this provides an absolute exemption falling under s. 2 (2) (a) FOIA so that no public interest balancing exercise is required. 13. §. 40 (2) FOIA provides that information is exempt from disclosure if it is the personal data of a third party and that its disclosure would breach one of the data protection principles set out in schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The first data protection principle is that it must be fair and lawful to process (that is, disclose) the personal data. 14. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of | FOIA, as follows: | “Tf on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - | (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in | accordance with the law, or | (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the | Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, ithe Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 15. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. Conclusion 16. It is not disputed by the Appellant that the sensitive personal data of the constituent concerned should be redacted prior to disclosure of the letter from Mr Cameron. He seeks the disclosure of information which does not constitute sensitive personal data. 17. We are satisfied that there are parts of Mr Cameron’s letter which constitute sensitive personal data and which it would be unfair and in breach of the first data protection principle to disclose. However, having considered the un-redacted version of the letter contained in our closed bundle, we conclude that the redactions made by the CPS also encompass matters which do not constitute sensitive personal data. We find that it would be possible to disclose them without identifying the data subject. We disagree with the Respondent’s assessment that it would not be possible to redact sensitive personal data but disclose the remainder. 18. We have set out in a confidential annexe to this Decision a revised set of redactions for Mr Cameron’s letter, in relation to which we are satisfied that the redacted information constitutes sensitive personal data within the meaning given to that term by s. 40 (2) FOIA. The information we have redacted would identify the constituent concerned in relation to the alleged offence and we find it would be unfair and in breach of the DPA to do so. However, the parts of the letter which we have not directed to be redacted would not in our opinion identify the constituent concerned and, accordingly, we find that they do not constitute personal data or sensitive personal data. We conclude that the Decision Notice is erroneous in having permitted wide-ranging redactions in relation to which the exemption claimed is not engaged. 19. This appeal is accordingly allowed and we now direct the CPS to take steps to | disclose the remaining parts of the letter in accordance with the confidential annexe to | this Decision. | ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 16 February 2017 : PRINCIPAL JUDGE Promulgated: 16 February 2017"

This appeal is allowed (with minor redactions of 3rd party data). This appeal is against the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice FS50588183 dated 1st October 2015 which held that Hambleton District Council (the Council) had applied regulation 13 EIRs correctly in order to withhold the disputed information. The Commissioner required no steps to be taken. Background 2. The airfield which is referred to in the information request is located in an administrative area for which the Council is the Local Planning Authority. It has been the subject of active opposition to its activities from parts of the local community for several years. Originally there had been: 1 Please see Chamber President’s ruling in relation to the restriction upon identification of the Appellant; the Appellant was represented by Goodman Derrick LLP“a planning permission limited to a named person and to the number of flights. The airfield has operated in contravention of that permission 2 . The Council missed a number of opportunities to notice the unlawful use and to take appropriate action. As a result the unauthorised use became immune from enforcement action 3 and the Council has lost planning control over the number of aircraft using the airfield…”4 3. There has been a long history of enforcement notices and planning appeals and several public inquiries about the airfield’s activities including a report by the Local Government Ombudsman in light of complaints made relating to the Council’s handling of the situation. The Ombudsman made a finding that “losing control over the use of land as an airfield is an extreme and most serious failure of planning administration. It has come about because the Council’s planning officers failed to take appropriate action or make appropriate inquiries” 5 . She made a finding of Council maladministration which had caused local residents injustice in the form of disturbance from flights and apprehension about the possibility of uncontrolled future expansion. The Ombudsman’s recommendations included that the Council should consider taking action to try to stop the current use. 4. Following the LGO report 14 enforcement notices were issued, the appeals against these (the majority of which were dismissed) were heard at Public Inquiry in May 2012. In September 2012 the Planning Committee resolved not to use a discontinuance notice at this time. Further enforcement notices were issued in December 2012 and their appeals were heard in June and October 2013. The appeal relating to the use of a jet fuel facility was unsuccessful and removal in compliance with the order was required by 22nd July 2014. In May 2014 the Planning Committee reconsidered the issue of discontinuance and resolved that the making of a Discontinuance Order be not considered further and an appropriate monitoring regime be investigated. 5. For the time period envisaged within the information request the Council was corresponding with the owner of the airfield to try to monitor compliance with planning restrictions, the enforcement notice and to monitor airfield use6. Information Request 6. On 2nd June 2014 the Appellant wrote to the Council asking for: “details of all contact from 1 January [2014] to the present day between officers or Members of Hambleton District Council and [name redacted] and/or his representatives concerning [named airfield] This should include copies of all emails, texts, letters, notes of meetings or telephone conversations” A subsequent similar request was submitted dated 9th September 2014 which had the effect of increasing the period within the scope of the request to 9th September 2014. 7. The Council refused to provide information relating to existing legal challenges and costs issues and in relation to the rest of the information to refuse to confirm or deny that the information was held. However, following a complaint to the Commissioner, a consent order (EA/2015/0064) was agreed and a fresh refusal notice issued leading to the Decision Notice that is the subject of this appeal. 2 Since 1997 when the airfield changed hands 3 Due to uninterrupted use for a period of 10 years since 2007 the Council have had no control over the number of flights. 4 P153 OB 5 P164 OB 6 As apparent from the correspondence in OB38. In the refusal notice of 11th June 2015 the Council refused the request upon the grounds that the information still in dispute was personal data relating to 3rd parties. This decision was upheld upon internal review dated 26th June 2015 when the Council further relied upon s30(1)(b) FOIA7 maintaining that the public interest favoured non- disclosure. Complaint to the Commissioner 9. Following a complaint to the Commissioner dated 3rd July 2015, the Commissioner investigated the case. The Commissioner was satisfied that the request fell to be considered under EIRs. There has been no challenge to that determination. Appeal 10. The Appellant appealed on 15th October 2015 the grounds can be summarised as being that: <U+F0B7> The information was not personal data, <U+F0B7> There was no expectation of privacy and disclosure would not be unfair, <U+F0B7> There was a pressing social need for disclosure which outweighed any prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 11. In a letter from the Registrar on 20th November 2015 the Council were invited to apply to join which would enable them to make any representations relating to the Appeal for example arguments about s30 of FOIA in addition to arguments about the personal data exemption.8 They did not choose to join at that stage however they were joined by the Tribunal on 29th March 2016 as the Tribunal had concerns that not all the disputed information in scope had been identified. 12. All parties have consented to the case being determined upon the papers. The Tribunal has had regard to the overriding objective as set out in rule 2 GRC rules and has had regard to costs, proportionality and the narrow issues in this case and the Tribunal’s ability to seek further information through written directions. The Tribunal has had regard to all the documentary evidence before it, even where not mentioned directly in this decision. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing pursuant to rule 32(1) GRC Rules; being in receipt of: i. open material <U+F0B7> Open bundle 1 (comprising 166 pages). <U+F0B7> Open bundle 2 (Attachments from the Appellant and the Council to the Council’s open response of 27.4.16 and the Appellant’s response of 11.5.16 and the ICO’s open submissions of 12.5.16). <U+F0B7> Open bundle 3 (The Council’s open response of 1.7.16 and attachments). <U+F0B7> Documents 3,4 and 5 of the Closed bundle of 27.4.16 and some redacted submissions were also disclosed pursuant to the Tribunal’s rule 14 ruling of 22.9.16). ii. Closed material <U+F0B7> The original closed bundle of disputed information (and an un-redacted copy of some correspondence to the Commissioner), <U+F0B7> The Council’s closed submissions and attachments of 27.4.16. <U+F0B7> The ICO’s closed submissions of 12.5.16. 7 Concerning investigations which may lead to criminal proceedings by the Council 8 P73 OB<U+F0B7> The Councils closed submissions and attachments of 1st July 2016. 13. The Tribunal has dealt with all matters in the open decision save where direct reference needs to be made to the closed material in which case additional explanation is provided in the closed annex. Scope 14. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the open joinder and adjournment directions dated 29th March 2016 the Tribunal is satisfied that the period in scope is 1st January 2014 to 9th September 2014. The Consent order which disposed of EA/2015/0064 and triggered the refusal notice upon which this appeal is based, only dealt with the neither confirm nor deny material. Consequently, we are satisfied that the scope of the appeal excludes the legal challenges and costs material itemised in the letter of 13th June 2014. 15. We are required to confine our consideration of the exemptions to the “relevant date” which pursuant to the reasoning in APPGER v ICO and FCO [2015] UKUT 377 (AAC) is the date of the public authority’s refusal. Although the date of the request was 9th September 2014 the operative refusal was 11th June 2015 (despite the original consideration having been in September 2014). In light of the past history of the case and the correspondence that took place prior to the information request, we are satisfied that there is no material difference in the material factors between these 2 considerations of the request by the Council. 16. Despite being satisfied that the correct date range had been identified by the Council, the Tribunal had concerns that not all the withheld material within scope had been identified. The Tribunal was satisfied that a record of “contact” between the airfield and the Council would include copies of all emails, texts, letters, notes of meetings or telephone conversations, diary entries or handwritten notes recording a personal meeting or a telephone call or an account of a meeting provided in correspondence to a third party. Specific examples based on the withheld information were given in closed directions. The Tribunal also asked for further information about information already in the public domain or disclosed to those outside the Council without restriction. The Tribunal is satisfied that within the scope of this appeal is the issue of whether all the information held by the Council had been correctly identified and considered for disclosure. 17. The Council relied upon reg 13 EIRs and also s 30 FOIA for withholding the information before the Commissioner. The ICO’s decision notice was limited to the first ground in light of its findings. The Council have not pleaded s30 FOIA specifically in their response neither have they withdrawn their reliance upon it. The Tribunal is satisfied that it remains a ground upon which they seek to withhold the information in the alternative. The Tribunal has considered whether it is necessary to adjourn the case again to seek representations upon this ground. Having regard to the overriding objective as set out in rule 2 we are satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice that the case is further adjourned. The Council were alerted to the fact that if the Tribunal did not agree with the ICO’s findings s30 FOIA fell to be considered in the Registrar’s letter of 20th November 2015 and were invited to join the appeal and to make representations on that point. They chose not to and the Tribunal proceeds on the basis of the representations made before the Commissioner. Sufficiency of material identified by the Council 18. In light of the further information that has been provided pursuant to adjournment directions, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Council had failed to identify all theinformation in scope and had performed an inadequate search. Not all the information in scope was before the Commissioner. The Tribunal is satisfied that: <U+F0B7> Document 19, Document 3 (the Template for monitoring10) and Documents 4 and 5 (photographs) were in scope and wrongly omitted from the disputed information in error. <U+F0B7> Document 2 we are satisfied is not in scope.11 19. Additionally, there are reports of contact with the airfield set out in the information disclosed to the community which is not reflected in the closed material. The Tribunal has seen examples where the original complaint is reflected in the disputed information but the source of the Airfield’s response which was passed on to the complainant does not appear.12 If the original response is no longer kept, the record of the content as set out in the response to the complainant is still evidence of contact and thus was in scope. This is a case where verbal communication has not been routinely logged and record keeping appears to have been poor. We have considered whether it is proportionate to adjourn again for further information and have concluded that it is not. Disclosure of the fact of this additional contact and the substance of it has now been provided (in OB3) and we accept that the Council have checked such records as they have retained. On a balance of probabilities, we are not satisfied that a further adjournment would reveal any further information. 20. The Open Bundle 3 (OB3) includes correspondence between the Council and Parish Councils and individuals. This correspondence refers to visits which are not reflected in the closed material. Although we are satisfied from the searches that have been made that no notes have been retained (if any were made) and there are no diary entries relating to the visits or email correspondence arranging them, we are satisfied that where correspondence reports what took place at a visit, if the visit was in the presence of a member of airfield staff that would constitute a record of contact within scope and is another example of the Council failing to conduct a sufficient search for information in scope. We have considered whether to adjourn to establish whether these visits were accompanied or not but are satisfied that this is not proportionate as the information potentially in scope has now been disclosed in OB3. However, we highlight the Council’s record keeping which we consider inadequate: there are no records of telephone calls and no consistent retained record of meetings. There is no log of the destruction of any handwritten notes the retention of which reflects a judgment upon what information should be retained based on relevance or incorporated elsewhere. 21. The Commissioner observed during the appeal process that information which is within the scope of the request but publicly available should either be provided or itemised and pleaded as an exemption. We consider this particularly important in this case as information already available informs the expectation of the data subject, the fairness of and need for disclosure. EIRs 22. The Commissioner did not consider it necessary to separate the differing access regimes to distinguish between information which is environmental information for the purposes of EIR and FOIA as both access regimes apply in the same way relating to the exemption of third party data. The ICO did however consider that the information 9 See closed annex 10 This has now been disclosed pursuant to this appeal and was included in the consultation with the local community. 11 See closed annex 12 See closed annexwas all likely to fall within the scope of the EIRs and provided its reasoning with regard to the regulations.13 23. The Council did not dispute the ICO’s treatment of the disputed information as environmental information in the Decision notice, and it is not raised by either party in this appeal. However, for the sake of clarity the Tribunal is satisfied that the disputed information falls to be considered under EIRs. Environmental information is defined in reg2 of EIRs as: any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on— (a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape …; (b) factors, such as… noise… emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements… 24. The disputed information relates to planning enforcement and information on changes to the landscape and noise carried out by the owner at the airfield. Consequently, the applicable regulations that fall to be considered by the Tribunal are Regulation 13 EIRs and Regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs. Reg 13 - Personal data 25. 13.—(1) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject and as respects which either the first or second condition below is satisfied, a public authority shall not disclose the personal data. (2) The first condition is— (a)in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under these Regulations would contravene— (i)any of the data protection principles…. Schedule 1 of the DPA provides that: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a)at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met... It is not disputed that the relevant condition from Schedule 2 is: 6(1)The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. Personal Data 26. The Appellant disputes that the information requested is personal data. Section 1 of the Data protection Act provides that: “personal data” means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— 13 Para 10 DNa) from those data, or b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual; 27. There is no presumption in favour of disclosure of personal data.14 The principle data subject is named in the information request, his status as owner and operator of the airfield is in the public domain and we are satisfied therefore that redaction would not anonymise the information so that it was no longer attributable. We are satisfied having regard to the withheld information that the data subject is identifiable both as the owner and operator of the airfield and also in relation to contact that he has participated in (by way of conversation, meeting or correspondence). For this reason we are satisfied that all of the withheld information constitutes his personal data as it is on his behalf. The disputed information also includes personal data relating to 3rd parties who are identified directly within the disputed information as employees or contractors of the airfield. We are satisfied that this is their personal data as the disputed information details their actions, opinions and at times whereabouts. We are satisfied, however, that where necessary their personal details can be redacted as whilst it might be known that an individual is an employee or contractor of the airfield it would not necessarily be known that they were involved in a particular interaction (as opposed to a different employee or contractor). 28. The Appellant maintains that the information will be about the business and not the sole trader and that nothing personally about him will be revealed. We agree with the Commissioner that the personal data relates to the data subjects. In relation to the owner of the airfield it is about his business or professional life. The data subject has a professional life separate from the airfield which the Appellant argues means that the airfield is an ancillary or outside business interest and of insufficient biographical importance to fall within the definition of personal data. We disagree, the fact that it relates to part of his life rather than all of his life does not remove its biographical significance for example in terms of financial implications to be drawn from the success or failure of the business as well as revealing his actions and opinions, his approach to the running of this business and his relationship with the Council’s enforcement team. 29. The Appellant also argues that it would be inconsistent if ancillary business interests were capable of exemption under FOIA/EIRs through reliance on DPA whereas one man businesses which are limited companies are not.15 In relation to sole traders, information relating to their business also relates to their private lives as it is harder to separate the business dealings of a sole trader from their private life than it would an employee of a limited company which has a distinct legal personality and is distanced from the actions of individuals working within them. The success or failure of the business of a sole trader has a direct relationship to the financial and personal interest of the individual. Indeed the Commissioner’s decision relied upon by the Appellant reflected the difference and held that information about the business of a sole trader will be about the sole trader. 30. The Appellant further argues that the ICO’s finding that the disputed information in this case is personal data is inconsistent with its submissions before the Tribunal in EA/2015/0064 when the ICO asserted that information concerning the airfield would be unlikely to involve “distinctly private communications.16” These arguments did not 14 Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner 2008 1 WLR 1550 15 FS50450700High Peak Borough Council 16 P22 OBpurport to determine whether the content of the disputed information was personal data rather whether by its nature confirmation of the fact of its existence would breach the data protection principles. The Tribunal has had regard to paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Decision notice and is satisfied that there is no inconsistency in the Commissioner’s approach. Whether disclosure would be fair 31. Schedule 1 part II DPA provides: 1(1)In determining for the purposes of the first principle whether personal data are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed. 32. The Appellant argues that the information is only minimally intrusive as they have not asked for enforcement related issues and want the “further information” that the Council holds. They list issues that they believe would be encompassed in this “further information”. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is not possible to separate the information in this way, any investigation of complaints, monitoring of activity and compliance with planning regulations is information which may form the basis of subsequent enforcement proceedings or may be used to challenge them should they arise. 33. The information contains some biographical detail: it is already known that the data subject is the proprietor but it reveals the amount of contact with the Council the nature of the relationship (how cordial/how coercive) and may include some detail of whereabouts and the view/opinions of the data subject and the attitude of the Council towards him and his business. However, it relates to business activity and not an activity he undertakes in his private life. Hence, we agree with the ICO who has accepted at paragraph 36 of its submissions that the airfield owner cannot expect the same level of privacy in relation to information concerning his business or professional life as he would if the information related only to his personal or family life.17 34. The Council’s case is that the information was provided voluntarily (albeit on the understanding that the airfield could be compelled to provide much of the information18) the implication being that the data subject might have chosen to be less forthcoming if he had understood that the information was to be disclosed. 35. The Tribunal is satisfied that the data subject’s expectation is material in this regard. In the original internal review the Council argued that “the owner of the airfield could legitimately expect that the Council would not release information about any contacts with the Council other than information relating to formal action by the Council, information already in the public domain or information which that person has agreed should be released.”19 The Commissioner held that in light of the history of the airfield, the data subject would understand that his dealings would be under scrutiny by the local community, explanations would be reported back to complainants or information disclosed pursuant to normal planning laws. Matter relating to previous enforcement had been published and current issues were subject to media coverage therefore there was less expectation that the information would remain completely private. 17 Whilst not bound by previous ICO decisions, the Tribunal is satisfied that the ICO approach was consistent with FS50450700 and FS50547446 18 eg s196A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 makes provision for Council’s planning officers to gain entry to land for enforcement and monitoring purposes at any reasonable time. The Act does not require prior approval. 19 P87 OB36. The ICO refers to the Enforcement and Compliance Policy20 which states that the Council will try to resolve matters via negotiation with formal enforcement action being used as a reasonable and last resort. The ICO argues that whilst the data subject would be aware that the contact would be likely to become public should formal enforcement proceedings take place, his expectation until then is that the information would remain private. 37. The Tribunal is not satisfied that in light of the past history of this case that this would create an expectation of privacy. Negotiation does not imply secrecy although it is different from the glare of formal enforcement proceedings and the Tribunal takes into consideration the planning enquiries and challenges to the Council’s handling of this case which mean that there has been more information in the public domain historically than might otherwise be the case. 38. Additionally, the Tribunal takes into consideration that the Planning committee had resolved on 29th May 2014 that: “an appropriate monitoring regime be investigated21”. The Council were seeking to agree a scheme of monitoring with the airfield management and were explicit that they would consult with the two Parish councils and Action4 Refusal on the proposed monitoring arrangements. It is apparent from the correspondence in the additional open bundle that the airfield were aware of the consultation process and hence that information would be provided to these groups in order to enable the consultation to take place. We are satisfied that this removes any expectation of privacy as to the level of contact and the substance of what is agreed including options that are excluded and the reasoning behind that. 39. Similarly, we are satisfied that there was no expectation of privacy in relation to correspondence relating to complaints. Disclosure to members of the public was understood by the Council to put information in the public domain. The Council’s evidence is that a standard response in a complaint is: “for the council to advise the complainant that the complaint would be investigated and a reply given to the complainant. … No restriction was placed on upon the complainant regarding dissemination of the information it is known to the Council that information is circulated between residents with a common interest in the operation of the airfield”.22 40. It is apparent from OB3 23 that information emanating from the airfield has been provided to the complainants and that in order to receive this explanation details of the complaint must have been passed to the airfield. In none of the correspondence that we have seen in the open or closed material is there any expression of confidentiality suggesting that the airfield’s reply would not be passed on or restriction on the use or subsequent dissemination of the information. Whilst (as in OB3) it is to be expected that the details of the complainants (individuals complaining in relation to their home life) would not be passed on, any explanation must clearly emanate from the airfield even if there is no direct attribution to the owner. 41. The Council’s approach as demonstrated in the information that was disclosed without restriction prior to the information request to Parish Councils and members of the public and Action4 Refusal is inconsistent with the withholding of the disputed information. In relation to the monitoring, direct quotations from a named Consultant acting on behalf of the airfield are provided as is a spreadsheet template that the 20 P69OB 21 OB3 22 From closed submissions of 27.4.16 disclosed pursuant to rule 14 ruling of 22.9.16 23 E.g. email of 27th March 2014 OB3Council argued was omitted from the disputed information in error but which has now been disclosed pursuant to the Appeal process. It is evident from OB3 that this had in fact already been disclosed without restriction prior to the information request.24 42. From OB3 it is also apparent that details of visits to the airfield and their approximate date elements of what was observed/took place and the reasons for the visit were given in this open correspondence prior to the information request25 and once again the Council’s actions are inconsistent with their assertion of the data subject’s expectation. Additionally, the Council have provided an outline commentary of the status of the compliance with the enforcement orders and has responded to concerns raised about possible planning infringements. 43. The Council argued that some of the withheld material might be evidence in enforcement proceedings and there was no expectation that information the Appellant might need as evidence would become public prior to formal proceedings commencing. The Tribunal disagrees and observes that there is no distinction between e.g. information given to complainants and the type of evidence that might be needed to be used by the data subject in future enforcement proceedings. 44. In relation to employees, contractors of the airfield and 3rd parties referred to within the correspondence, the Tribunal has had regard to their seniority and level of responsibility and the nature of their involvement in the situation and whether the substance of their involvement with the airfield was already in the public domain. Where involvement is in a professional capacity, without restrictions and the detail of the individual’s involvement is already in the public domain we are satisfied that disclosure pursuant to this request would not be unfair. In relation to employees, even those with forward facing roles are acting on behalf of the airfield owner whose business venture this is. The Tribunal is satisfied that they would have a greater expectation of privacy as the ultimate responsibility for the way that the airfield is run lies with their employer, they can be assumed to be acting within their employer’s instructions and elements of the disputed information may shed light on the nature of their relationship with their employer, the way they conduct themselves at work as well as biographical details such as their whereabouts at specific dates and times. We are satisfied however, that any expectation and unwarranted intrusion can be addressed through redaction of their name and job title. Similarly, where 3rd parties are referred to we have had regard to the context of their involvement and whether they have had any input or control over the personal data relating to them. Where they have not we are satisfied that their name should be redacted. Consequences of disclosure. 45. Much of the information we are satisfied was already in the public domain at the date of the information request. It is argued that the data subject would be distressed by disclosure in light of the data subject’s expectation that the information would not be made public unless formal proceedings were commenced. There was a contentious relationship between the data subject and parts of the community hence it is argued that disclosure of correspondence would be distressing. 46. We repeat our findings as set out above relating to the reasonable expectation of the airfield owner in relation to the majority of the withheld information disclosure of which we are satisfied would not be unfair. We acknowledge that in relation to specified 24 Email 17.7.14 OB3 25 Email 20.6.14 and 5.8.14 OB3information26 where the correspondence is candid and focused more on administrative issues than public facing matters that the data subject’s expectation may have been that he could speak freely in the belief that the information would not be disclosed. There was a contentious relationship between the data subject and parts of the community hence we accept that disclosure of that correspondence would be unwelcome. We are not however, satisfied that disclosure would be unfair both because there was no explicit undertaking of confidentiality and because public scrutiny was to be expected in light of the history of this case and the pressing social need as outlined below. Schedule 2 condition 6 47. We have gone on to consider whether disclosure meets Schedule 2 condition 6 and whether there was a pressing social need27 for the information to be disclosed which outweighs the expectations of the individual. 48. The Appellant argues that there is a pressing social need for disclosure: a) In light of the Ombudsman’s finding of maladministration arising from “extreme and most serious failure of planning administration…the Council’s planning officers failed to take appropriate action or make appropriate inquiries”. There is an enhanced need for transparency to enable checks and scrutiny to assess the adequacy of the Council’s handling of the situation. Disclosure would go towards rebuilding lost confidence or ensuring proper control is maintained. b) The information is in the context of local wishes to place operational limits on the airfield’s activities. Disclosure would give visibility to the attempts the Council had made to achieve some kind of control other than taking planning enforcement measures which the Appellant argues have failed in the past in important respects. c) The LGO recommended partial discontinuance be considered as an alternative and in the face of considerable local opposition, the Council instead undertook to engage in dialogue leading to an appropriate monitoring system – disclosure would provide scrutiny of the effectiveness of Council’s strategic choice. This would show whether the airfield is seriously engaging in an attempt by the Council to bring about agreement of a voluntary code and inform public understanding of the adequacy of the Council’s policy choice. 49. The Council argued that there was no pressing social need for disclosure which was therefore unwarranted: i. They already published information necessary to demonstrate that it is monitoring the situation at the airfield and to demonstrate the actions it takes in respect of breaches to any planning conditions. ii. There were 2 outstanding enforcement notices against the airfield and subject to appeal – therefore it was evident that the Council continued to monitor and where appropriate seek to regulate the activities of the airfield28 iii. The Council regulates the planning laws not the community therefore disclosure is not necessary to ensure planning laws are upheld. iv. Disclosure would make it more difficult to monitor and regulate the airfield if the data subject withdraws co-operation and a formal route became necessary in future. v. There are other bodies to complain to about public actions (e.g. the MP, the LGO and Judicial review) which goes some way to satisfy the public interest in ensuring that they are acting as they should and appropriate remedies can be suggested or ordered by these bodies. 26 See closed annex 27 Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner [2008] EWHC 1084 (Admin) 28 P128 OBRedaction of employee details and dates 50. We are satisfied that in relation to the names of employees, disclosure would not further the legitimate interests of the information requesters or the public. The responsibility lies with the owner of the airfield and the identity of particular employees does not inform the Council’s accountability or further the scrutiny of the conduct of the case. 51. In relation to the rest of the disputed information in light of the unfortunate past history of the Council’s handling of the planning situation which included: <U+F0B7> The Council being on notice that the operation of the airfield was in breach of planning conditions but not taking action. <U+F0B7> Not making arrangements to monitor the number of flights. <U+F0B7> Despite having identified the need for planning permission taking no further action to follow this up, <U+F0B7> An enforcement officer wrongly assessed that the 1980 planning permission still applied notwithstanding the change of owner. We accept that there is an enhanced need for scrutiny and transparency of the Council’s actions, the rigour with which they pursue the case and the accuracy of the factual and legal basis upon which they are operating. 52. We are satisfied that this cannot be fulfilled by the information already made public by the Council in light of previous instances of incomplete or inaccurate information being provided. In relation to information in a letter from the Council to the local MP29; the Ombudsman did not find it necessary to make a finding about whether this was a separate instance of maladministration but did find that the letter to the MP: “does not mention the most significant issues to do with the airfield and does not reflect the spirit of community involvement in town planning. It was factually incorrect…”30 53. Additionally, the information in the public domain does not provide sufficient information relating to the rigour with which the planning regulations and enforcement notices were enforced and the degree to which the airfield was co-operating. 54. It was argued that there was a benefit in having an informal route outside of public view to reach a resolution prior to the expense and risk of enforcement action. The Council were concerned that disclosure might reduce their ability to use an informal route or result in the data subject being less forthcoming, this would make the Council’s regulatory role harder and increase the possibility of enforcement action in future. The Tribunal does not accept this and notes that there was some evidence in the public domain prior to the information request that the informal route had failed: “The new arrangement [the airfield] has implemented is not what the Council understood he was going to do and we are currently seeking legal advice on whether what he has done complies with the Enforcement Notice and if so whether planning permission is required.”31 The situation not being resolved at the date required by the enforcement notice, the public are entitled to know how this has arisen and the reasons why the Council understood a different situation would prevail. Disclosure will shed further light on the effectiveness of the strategy. This is particularly important because residents had raised the issue of prevarication and avoidance prior to the difficulties arising in August 2014: 29 P161-2 OB 30 P165 OB 31 OB3 letter of 13th August 2014“What then will HDC do in the face of [name’s] stated intention of using a mobile bowser? Wring its hands and say it has done its best or seek to have that removed and go through the appeal process again with all the attendant delays?32” We are satisfied that they are entitled to see whether their concerns were actioned appropriately at the time. 55. The need for scrutiny, transparency, and accountability is particularly important in light of the Council’s acknowledgment that the Tribunal might: “have expected to see more records concerning these issues. The Council however, has been subject to much criticism over the airfield, not least from residents concerning the contact residents believe the Council has had with [named individual] over the years however incorrect those assumptions may be. The situation locally has become very contentious. Mindful of this the Council has sought to limit its contact with the airfield to try to allay the perceptions of residents”.33 As set out above, the Tribunal has concerns that the information originally identified within the closed material was incomplete and has had the opportunity to compare the open bundles with the material in the disputed information for inconsistencies and to assess the rigour with which all issues were pursued. 56. We are satisfied that disclosure of actual contact, its nature, frequency, tone and content is necessary in order to repair the trust with residents and to assess whether the Council’s contact is sufficient to fulfil their obligations. This applies to all the withheld information including that where the communication was candid and there may have been some expectation that the communication was private. This information is material to assessing the efficacy and appropriateness of the Council’s approach. Although we acknowledge that there are alternative remedies e.g. Complaint to an MP, Ombudsman etc. we repeat our observations relating to the accuracy of information provided to an MP historically and consequently the need for the source material in order to ensure accuracy. Additionally, we accept that in holding the Council to account the residents need evidence of what is being done and before it is too late to remedy it; we take into consideration that by the time the LGO was involved, it was too late, planning control had been lost. Sensitive Personal Data 57. It has not been argued by any of the parties that the withheld material constitutes sensitive personal data. Sensitive personal data is defined in s2 DPA as consisting of information as to: (g)the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence The Tribunal’s view is that this is not sensitive personal data since at the time that the information was gathered no formal proceedings for breach had been brought. This view is consistent with the Council’s disclosures from the same time period as set out in OB3. 58. However, even if we are wrong and there is sensitive personal data within the disputed information, we are satisfied that disclosure would meet the Schedule 3 condition threshold. The first data protection principle provides that additionally: (b)in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met. The Schedule 3 conditions include that the processing— … (b)is necessary for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, or 32 Email of 02.04.14 OB3 33 Closed submissions of 27th April 2016 disclosed pursuant to rule 14 ruling of 22.9.16.(c)is otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal rights. 59. The Tribunal notes that the community have launched judicial review proceedings of the Council’s actions, they have challenged planning decisions and participated in planning enquiries, they have repeatedly sought legal advice about ways to establish, exercise and defend their legal rights relating to disturbance from flights and the possibility of uncontrolled future expansion. This was ongoing at the relevant date and continues now, we are satisfied that disclosure is necessary in furtherance of these aims and that conditions b) and c) above are therefore satisfied. Regulation 12(5)(b) EIRs 60. Before the Commissioner the Council also raised s30(1)b FOIA (investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities) as set out above the Tribunal is satisfied that the information falls to be considered under EIRs and that the applicable provision is reg12(5)(b) which provides: —(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if— (a)an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. … (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— … (b)the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature; 61. The Appellant argues that the exemption is not engaged as it does not concern investigations and proceedings conducted by the Council. 62. The Tribunal is satisfied that the information is in scope because any investigation of complaints, monitoring of activity and compliance with planning regulations is information which may form the basis of subsequent enforcement proceedings or may be used to challenge them should they arise. 63. We do not find that the exemption is engaged as we are not satisfied that disclosure would adversely affect the ability of the Appellant to receive a fair hearing or the Council to conduct any inquiry. We have had regard to the information that was in the public domain at the date of the information request which includes: i. That the airfield had told the Council that they would comply with the enforcement notice by the deadline. ii. The fact that the situation post the enforcement notice deadline was not “of the type that had been advised to the Council previously by [named individual]…” iii. The Council were taking legal advice, both on whether this constitutes a breach of the enforcement notice and whether planning permission is required for the new tank arrangement.34 64. In any event we are satisfied that the public interest favours disclosure. We take into consideration the presumption in favour of disclosure and the need for accountability, scrutiny and transparency as set out above. Whilst (arguably) the most damaging elements of the situation were in the public domain, (namely what had been observed during visits, what was agreed in terms of compliance and the fact that the Council were taking legal advice with a view to formal proceedings) how the situation had 34Eg letters of 29.8.14 and 8.9.14 OB3arisen was not apparent nor whether any fault was attributable to the Council’s handling of the situation. 65. It is argued that disclosure would reduce the likelihood of co-operation with the airfield in the future which would prejudice their ability to investigate. We disagree and have had regard to the Council’s statutory powers and the self interest inherent in not being prosecuted for a breach of an enforcement order in assessing the likely impact of disclosure on future conduct. Conclusion 66. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that (apart from the name and job titles redacted as set out in the closed schedule which should remain redacted as their disclosure would be unfair and would be unwarranted) reg 13 was wrongly relied upon to withhold the disputed information. Additionally, we are satisfied that r12(5)(b) is not engaged in relation to the information and we are satisfied that in any event the public interest favours disclosing the disputed information. Steps 67. The Council shall disclose within 35 calendar days from the date of this decision: Document 1 (Documents 3,4 and 5 having already been disclosed) and the disputed information (with the redactions as specified in the closed annex). 68. A redacted version of the closed annex may also be promulgated after paragraph 67 has been complied with. 69. This decision is unanimous.

"129","Procedural Refusal","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0152 Heard without a hearing On 30 November 2016 Before MELANIE CARTER JUDGE HENRY FITZHUGH NIGEL WATSON TRIBUNAL MEMBERS Between FRANK ELLIS Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS 1. This is an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the Act”) by Frank Ellis against the decision of theInformation Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) in his Decision Notice of 12 May 2016 . The Tribunal has decided, for the reasons set out below, to uphold the appeal. Background 1. This appeal relates to a request for information made by Mr Ellis, the Appellant to Ryedale District Council (“the Council”) on 5 January 2016. It is not in dispute that this matter should be dealt with under the Environmental Information Regulations (“EIR2), rather than the Freedom of Information Act 2000. 2. The Appellant wrote on 5 January 2016 asking for the following information: “A pipe runs form the….development….across land adjacent to the site en route to a water course. The pipe is designed to remove waste surface water (rain). I require the name of the landowner(s) under whose land the pipe has been laid. For the avoidance of doubt I require the name/identity of the landowner(s) at the time [the Council] issued written approval to the developer authorising the start of the development, as stipulated in the Schedule of Conditions for Appeal”. 3. The Council refused the request on the basis that the information was not held. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who in turn rejected the complaint. The Appellant has now appealed on the basis that the information is held. The issue before the Tribunal is to decide on the balance of probabilities whether or not the Council did hold the requested information. 4. There had been two previous requests under FOIA, the refusals for which the Appellant had not pursued. Those two requests are strictly not part of this appeal, but form part of the factual backdrop to the issues before the Tribunal. Also relevant was a later FOIA request in May 2016 as the information disclosed further to that request was relevant as to the Council’s knowledge of the legal ownership of the land during 2015.5. It was apparent from the Appellant’s submissions and evidence that the Council had been corresponding with the person which the Council believed to be the owner of the relevant plot of land as late as November 2015. This aspect had not been considered by the Commissioner in the Decision Notice, referring there only to ‘historic information’ (that is information indicating ownership of the land held by the Council) dating back to between 2008-2011. 6. In light of the later evidence apparently held by the Council indicating knowledge of ownership as late as November 2015, the Tribunal directed the Commissioner to expand upon its arguments and to address this specific evidential point. The refusal of the request for information as to ownership was January 2016 (just two months later). The Tribunal stated in the Directions that: “Also relevant were the letters and email evidence adduced by Dr Ellis between 2014-2015, which Dr Ellis argued went to prove that the Council had been incorrect in asserting the information requested as to ownership of the land was not held. 5. The Tribunal has issued the following directions requiring the ICO to now assist in the analysis of whether: a. The commissioner had been correct to accept the word of the Council, given the evidence in the bundle which Dr Ellis asserted indicated a knowledge of the ownership of the land post-dating 2011 (the latest of which may have been November 2015); “ 7. The Commissioner failed, in its response to the Directions, to deal with this point, despite the clear and careful directions from the Tribunal. The Commissioner stated as follows: “The Commissioner understands that, at various points in the past, the Council did hold information about the ownership of ‘site 160’. As set out at [DN para 22], the Commissioner considered whether or not the fact that the Council had known about the site ownership in the past meant that the Council also knew who owned the site at the relevant time set out in therequest (ie: at the time the Council issued written approval to the developer). It was established that the relevant written approval was issued on 1 February 2016 (ie after the date of the January 2016 request). Having probed the matter with the Council, the Commissioner accepted that it did not have current ownership information, and noted that it had no business need to know such information (ie for the discharge of conditions). This led to the Commissioner’s finding that the information was not held. Accordingly, the Commissioner does not consider that the factual background was in this case determinative for the request that she considered. Given the precise terms of the request at issue, which refers to the ‘name/identity of the landowner(s) at the [specific] time [the Council] issued written approval to the developer’ rather than, for instance, more generally, the Commissioner stands by her interpretation of the request, and her DB. Accordingly, whilst it would have been open to the Council to give details of any historic information it held, It was not a failing under FOIA for it not to do so”. 8. The Council had also written to the Tribunal in response to the directions in a letter dated 25 November 2016. 9. The Tribunal took the view that the approach of both the Commissioner and before that, the Council, was both narrow and artificial. It was clear from the request that the Appellant was asking as to current ownership as at the date of the letter of request, given the written approval had presumably either just been given or was about to be given (which it was, within the month). The Tribunal accepted, first that the Council was not under any legal duty further to any planning function to hold up to date information as to legal ownership of land. In particular, planning officers on the explanation of the Council, did not need to concern themselves with land ownership and easements relating to offsite drains serving a development.10. That did not however mean that it did not, as a matter of fact (rather than further to a duty) hold information as to ownership of land. The Tribunal accepted there would come a point when the Council would no longer have reasonable confidence the information was correct. However, it would be a question of fact and degree as to when that information became so old that it could not reliably be said to meet a request for information, in effect, as to current ownership. In these circumstances, the Tribunal would have accepted that just because it knew, historically, the name of the legal owner of the relevant plot of land, it could not respond with any accuracy to a request asking for current ownership. In this case however, it was clear that the Council had, certainly as late as April 2015 and perhaps as late as November 2015 (just two months previously) relied upon its own information to write out to the legal owner and/or to refer others to the name of the legal owner. The Council would only have done so if it still believed that the named individual was still the current owner just two months before, it was then claimed that this information was no longer valid. The Commissioner and the Council were given an opportunity to respond to this point in the Directions, but failed to do so. 11. It appears from the Council’s letter that officers are (understandably) incensed at the Appellant’s allegation that officers are lying to him. The Council’s letter references the case of Paul Gadd v The Information Commissioner EA/2014/0211 and a quote with regard to “unfounded assaults on the integrity of members of the staff”. That case however was with regard to whether a request was ‘manifestly unreasonable’ or in FOIA terms, a request was vexatious. This case concerns a straightforward analysis, on the evidence, and to the balance of probabilities, whether the information requested was held by the Council at the date of request. 12. Given the existence of the correspondence in this regard as late as November 2015 the Tribunal considers that it is more likely than not that the information as to the legal ownership of site 160 was held as at the date of the request in January 2016. This is specifically not a finding that the Council officers had been lying, rather that the approach of the Commissioner, given theinformation that the Tribunal has found was held at the relevant time, was ill- conceived and not in accordance with law. Conclusion 13. In light of the above reasoning, the Tribunal upholds the appeal and finds that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with law. The Decision Notice is hereby amended to order that the name/identity of the landowner as at the date of the request be disclosed to the Appellant. This should be disclosed within 28 days of this decision. Melanie Carter Judge of the First-tier Tribunal 11th December 2016 Promulgated 12th December 2016"
"138","Substantive Refusal","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2015/0282 Heard at Field House On 28 June 2016 Before JUDGE PETER LANE ANNE CHAFER SUZANNE COSGRAVE Between ANDREW LOWNIE Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Appearances: For the appellant: Mr G Callus, Counsel For the respondent: The respondent did not appear and was not representedDECISION AND REASONS A. Introduction 1. The appellant is an author and journalist. He has written a book called Stalin’s Englishman: The Lives of Guy Burgess. On 13 March 2015, the appellant wrote to The National Archives (TNA) requesting FCO28/4199/1 – Closed Extract: Folio 1 from Defectors to and from the Soviet Union, including Kim Philby. The relevant file was said by TNA to be exempt from disclosure under section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) on the basis that it contained the personal data of third persons. 2. The appellant complained to the Information Commissioner. On 9 November 2015, the Commissioner issued a notice of decision (FS 50586206), in which he concluded that TNA had correctly applied the exemption under section 40(2) because the information was the personal data of third persons and releasing it would contravene the Data Protection Act 1998. B. Appeal 3. The appellant appealed to the Tribunal. He said that, insofar as the disputed information concerned Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean and no other living individual, the Commissioner was wrong to accept that it constituted personal data. This was because the Data Protection Act does not protect individuals who have died. The Commissioner was said to be wrong to assume that the information related to living individuals. 4. The first data protection principle states:- “1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met; and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.” 5. The appellant contended that condition 6(1) in Schedule 2 was satisfied in his case. Condition 6(1) provides:- “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interest pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 6. The appellant additionally prayed in aid paragraph 5 of Schedule 3:- 2“5. The information contained in the personal data has been made public as a result of steps deliberately taken by the data subject.” In this regard, the appellant said that the publication by George Blake of his autobiography and his appearance in a television documentary satisfied paragraph 5. 7. The appellant also sought to rely on paragraph 10 of Schedule 3:- “10. The personal data are processed in circumstances specified in an order made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this paragraph.” The appellant contended that it was likely that the data he sought fell within paragraph 10. 8. Finally, the appellant contended that, insofar as the disputed information contains personal data which cannot lawfully be disclosed, the Commissioner ought to have required the disputed information to be released in redacted form. C. Discussion 9. In reaching our unanimous decision in this case, we have had regard to the materials contained in the open and closed bundles. We have also had regard to the submissions made orally by Mr Callus at the hearing. 10. The appellant originally contended that the TNA and by extension, the Commissioner had been wrong to rely on the presumption that, where it does not have evidence that an individual under 100 years of age is deceased, the TNA shall conclude that they are still living. This issue has, however, fallen away, since the Commissioner has confirmed that the individuals in question are still alive. 11. The Tribunal agrees with the Commissioner that where section 40(2) of FOIA is engaged, the Tribunal is required to undertake a different task from when it deals with other FOIA exemptions. Whilst FOIA in general promotes the right to information, where section 40(2) is under consideration, the proper approach is for the interest of data subjects to receive a high degree of protection. Whilst this does not mean that disclosure cannot be justified, it does mean that the Tribunal must be careful not to start from the position of presuming disclosure should occur. 12. The Commissioner confirmed (as do we) that the disputed information does not relate to George Blake. That ground of appeal, accordingly, falls away. 13. The Commissioner disagreed with the appellant that disclosure of the personal data would not be detrimental to the individuals concerned. The Commissioner considered that the relevant individuals would have a reasonable expectation that the withheld information would not be disclosed to the public. 314. The Tribunal agrees. Having looked at the closed material, there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that, in the particular circumstances of the case with which we are concerned, the fact the defector had defected would be known to the government of the defector’s place of residence or, in any event, to all the defector’s friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. There is also no reason to suppose that the individual who may have had an involvement with the defection has informed friends or family. 15. We do not consider that the appellant can, in the circumstances, successfully contend that the passage of time since the end of the Cold War would have greatly reduced the sensitivity of the information. On the contrary, having regard to the matters we have just mentioned, there is a strong expectation on the part of the individuals concerned that the withheld information would be kept confidential and not disclosed to the public as a whole. There is not, in the circumstances anything “unreasoned and speculative” involved in that finding. 16. Like the Commissioner, we agree that there is some public interest in information relating to defectors in general during the Cold War. However, the risk to these living individuals of disclosure, even at this remove, cannot be underestimated. It is quite possible that the personal relationships of each of them with family, friends and colleagues could be jeopardised. A precautionary approach is, accordingly, fully justified. 17. So far as concerns the ground which relies on paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 2, the appellant contends that disclosure is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests of research and journalism pursued by him and/or the legitimate interests of the public at large; and that such processing would not be unwarranted by reason of any prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects. 18. There is nothing in the Supreme Court judgments in South Lanarkshire Council v Scottish Information Commissioner [2013] UKSC 55, which casts doubt on the Divisional Court judgment in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v The Information Commissioner [2008] EWHC 1084 (Admin), where it was held that the word “necessary” in paragraph 6(1) reflected the meaning attributed to it by the European Court of Human Rights, when justifying an interference with a recognised right; that is to say, that there should be a “pressing social need and that the interference was both proportionate as to the means and fairly balanced as to ends”. 19. The Tribunal does not consider the appellant has shown there to be a “pressing social need” to disclose the identity of each and every defector, at whatever level and in whatever circumstances, during the period known as the Cold War. In any event, for the reasons we have given, there would be a real risk of serious prejudice to the legitimate interests of the data subjects, in the event of disclosure. The appellant has not demonstrated any social need that outweighs these serious concerns. 20. The appellant contends that if the disputed information contained sensitive personal data, then disclosure would meet certain of the conditions in Schedule 3. We accept that the data does not comprise or contain sensitive personal data. But, even if it did, the 4relevant provisions of the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2000 would not, in any event be engaged. As we have found, the data falls to be protected, as personal data. 21. The appellant’s final ground concerns whether material may be released in redacted form. The Commissioner considered that the level of redaction would be so extensive “that it would render the document meaningless to the reader”. Before us, Mr Callus submitted that the Commissioner had applied the wrong test. FOIA does not contain an exemption for material that may be meaningless. 22. We accept there may be situations where the result of all necessary redaction is such that the unredacted material is so exiguous that it cannot properly be said to constitute information, within the scope of FOIA. We have, however, concluded that the short letter which comprises the withheld material does, in its redacted form, constitute something that is sufficiently comprehensible to impart what can be categorised as information. Whether it is of any significant interest to the appellant, or anyone else, we rather doubt. 23. The Tribunal accordingly allows the appeal to the extent that the notice of decision is hereby amended, so as to require the public authority, not later than 35 days from the date of this decision, to disclose the withheld material in the redacted form set out in the Confidential Annex to this decision.

Action Required Plymouth County Council should respond to the request under the provisions of the Act Dated this 23rd day of July 2016 Judge Hughes [Signed on original] 3Appeal No: EA/2016/0028 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in these proceedings, Mr McNally, is concerned that a major firework competition held annually in Plymouth, which attracts very large audiences, has not been properly conducted. The competition is sponsored by Plymouth City Council (“the Council”) and organised by The Events Services Association (“TESA”). Following some concerns about the 2013 competition Mr McNally sought and received some information from the Council. There was some confusion over the scoring of the 2014 event due to the last minute change to the order of the competitors’ participation. Mr McNally requested and obtained the score sheets for 2014 (the PCC held them as they had in that year observed the scoring exercise). He states that these indicate that the 2014 prize was incorrectly awarded to the wrong competitor. He asked for the raw scores for the 2013 competition. The Council advised that they did not hold them, and that TESA, who did, had declined to release them. Following an investigation the Respondent in these proceedings, the Information Commissioner (“the ICO”), in a decision notice dated 19 May 2015, concluded that this information was held by TESA on its own account and not held by the Council and therefore could not be supplied by the Council under FOIA (FS50574178). 2. Following this decision Mr McNally on 26 August wrote to the Council seeking further information:- “I am requesting the full email correspondence between Plymouth City Council and the Events Services Association (TESA) in regards to the British Fireworks Competition and also any email correspondence between Plymouth City Council and the British Fireworks Pyrotechnicists Association (BPA) with regard to the British Fireworks Competition from its inception to the present.” 3. The Council responded stating that to do this would exceed the costs threshold provided for by s12 FOIA and upheld this position on internal review. Mr McNally then reformulated his request:- “…To simplify matters I will limit this request to the correspondence from the year 2012 through to 2015 (details as per original request). If you consider this is still too 4Appeal No: EA/2016/0028 burdensome in a single request please let me know as I could file separate requests for each period you and your colleagues feel you could comfortably handle within the time constraint…if that would help.” 4. Having considered this request the Council concluded that the request was vexatious and maintained that position on internal review. Mr McNally complained to the Respondent in these proceedings, the Information Commissioner (“ICO”). 5. The ICO considered the request in the round taking account of all the circumstances and following the approach set out in Dransfield. He considered the background and his previous involvement in the issues between Mr McNally and PCC (DN paragraphs 18-19), he noted PCCs view that complying with the request would involve further resources in a matter of no value to Mr McNally, the PCC or the public, PCC had no evidence to discredit the judging process and the approach was scattergun and unreasonably persistent. He considered proportionality and noted the purpose for the request set out by Mr McNally in his request for an internal review:- “… this latest request is asking for information not covered by the previous requests and is required for an investigation into alleged malpractice regarding the British Fireworks competition judging and subsequent award of monies as prizes of which the Council appear to finance in it's [sic] entirety”. 6. The ICO considered this was fishing ie a broad request without any clear idea what he was looking for. He note the efforts PCC had put into resolving Mr McNally’s complaint and the introduction of a Council officer into the scoring process and the publication of scores online. He noted that PCC:- “…has instigated discussions between TESA and all interested parties to discuss any issues regarding the BFC – which the complainant did not choose to attend.” He felt that Mr McNally’s response to the request to focus his information search in which he stated that he would “file separate requests for each period you and your colleagues feel you can comfortably handle within the time constraint” indicated that if PCC had agreed to Mr McNally’s approach it would have had to deal with not one large request but several small ones. 7. The ICO noted that Mr McNally was unhappy with the way TESA had scored competitors, PCC had gone to lengths to address his concerns and had no evidence of impropriety. He stated “FOIA is not a tool to be used in dealing with complaints about such matters”. He concluded that it was an attempt to reopen a matter which 5Appeal No: EA/2016/0028 had been subject to much public scrutiny and it was time to say:_ “enough is enough”. 8. In his appeal Mr McNally emphasised that his concern had been all along about the 2013 scoresheets. He had been told that PCC in January 2014 that it did not have them as they were held by TESA and TESA had not agreed to provide them. He stated (bundle page 14):- “TESA have been particularly obstructive with the 2013 data and it appears as if PCC are now protecting TESA because they realise how significant and potentially damaging the information would be to the event. It is because of this anomaly that I requested the email correspondence between TESA and PCC to ascertain what steps PCC had taken to obtain the requested documents and also TESA’s response to those requests, with hindsight I should have been more specific in the request but I was trying to avoid a situation where TESA and PCC would be in a position to redact the information I was interested in on some spurious grounds.” 9. He emphasised the significance of the public money involved as prize money. There had been a general invitation to discuss the issue addressed to the whole industry not to him personally; his view was that PCC had been concerned with what he was as the generally poor reputation of the competition in the industry rather than to address his concerns. 10. The ICO in his response maintained the arguments in the decision notice. He noted that PCC estimated that they had spent in excess of 55 hours in dealing with him. He noted that the request as now put forward was very different from that originally made – which had been for all email correspondence. If he were investigating malpractice regarding the judging and awarding of prizes, then his request for all correspondence was vexatious since he did not require all the correspondence, he could not now refine his request which was not what was requested or what the PCC and ICO had considered. It was not possible to refine the request during the appeal. The decision notice was based on an objective reading of the request and did not contain an error of law. 11. The ICO argued that there was unreasonable persistence in the pursuit of his concerns in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing. He noted that the disclosure of the 6Appeal No: EA/2016/0028 material requested was not necessary for the resolution of Mr McNally’s stated concerns about the 2013 and 2014 results. Mr McNally had not challenged the time estimates concerning the work PCC had put into meeting his concerns and while disclosure of the emails would provide greater transparency there was no evidence of wrongdoing and PCC had already acted to address his concerns. Any work to address this request would be disproportionate expenditure of time and accordingly the request was vexatious. Consideration 12. Mr McNally is concerned that a major public event, enjoyed by many tens of thousands of people each year and which is a significant competition for the fireworks industry has been poorly administered. He claims that as a result of these errors significant sums of public money – the prize put up by PCC have gone to the wrong competitors. He is aware that PCC does not hold raw data on the scoring of the competition but has asked for all emails between the organisers and PCC between 2012-2015. 13. The tribunal has some sympathy with the criticism that the request was broader than what Mr McNally now states he wanted. However the request was originally for all email correspondence (without time limit), this was in correspondence limited to a 4 year window, 2012 -2015, with an acknowledgement that if this was too burdensome narrow time periods could be considered – although while this “salami-slicing” still indicated a desire to obtain all the email traffic from 2012-2015 it did show a willingness to co-operate with PCC rather than a confrontational attitude; it showed Mr McNally’s lack of appreciation of the working of FOIA. If there was concern on the part of PCC that the request was unduly burdensome or unreasonable (in the light of the history of contact) it was open to PCC to respond to Mr McNally’s limitation of his request by seeking further clarification of what he wanted and seeking further limitation to what was proportionate and of potential value to Mr McNally. 14. The tribunal was satisfied that there was a public interest in the proper administration of a significant public event and competition; given the valid concerns that have been raised and the evidence provided of the confusion in the scoring in 2014 it was not unreasonable for Mr.McNally to seek the scoring sheets for 2013, given that he had seen them for 2014. It is not surprising that TESA’s decision to decline this request 7Appeal No: EA/2016/0028 should confirm concerns and suspicions in his mind about what happened in 2013. Against this background, it was therefore not unreasonable to seek disclosure of material passing between the PCC and TESA, the organiser of the competition, in the period relevant to those concerns. In our view this was not an unstructured ‘fishing’ exercise but had focus and a serious purpose. 15. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the ICO erred in his analysis of the underlying facts and his decision that the request was vexatious is therefore set aside. 16. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 23 July 2016 8"

Signed Tribunal Judge -2-EA/2015/0194 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), on 17 August 2015. 2. It arises from a request for information made to the Cabinet Office under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), by Mr. Gabriel Webber (the “Appellant”), a freelance journalist. The request concerned information about the Public Duty Cost Allowance (“PDCA”) which provides an allowance to former Prime Ministers, for office and secretarial expenses, incurred in connection with their public duties. The allowance is currently set at a maximum of £115,000 per year for each former Prime Minister. The Request 3. The Appellant’s request was made on 29 June 2014, on the following terms: “According to a PQ [Parliamentary Question] answered by Lord Wallace of Saltaire, former Prime Ministers can claim an allowance if they provide receipts or other supporting documentation. Please could you release the amount claimed by each former Prime Minister in each calendar year 2005-2013 inclusive, and also provide a copy of all receipts or other supporting documentation submitted in respect of this allowance since January 2012. If the cost threshold obstructs this then please provide ONLY copies of receipts and supporting documentation since June 2013.” 4. The Cabinet Office replied on 21 July 2014. It treated the request as consisting of two parts: (i) the total amount claimed by each former Prime Minister in the years 2005 to 2013; and (ii) copies of each former Prime Minister’s receipts and other supporting documentation. 5. It refused disclosure of the information within the scope of (i) on the basis of sections 21(1) and 22(1) of FOIA (information accessible by other means, and information intended for future publication). It refused to -3-disclose the information within the scope of (ii) on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA (third party personal data). 6. The Appellant requested an internal review of the Cabinet Office’s decision in respect of (ii). The Cabinet Office conducted a review, but maintained its refusal. Complaint to the Commissioner 7. On 30 October 2014, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner. He said that he accepted the Cabinet Office’s response in respect of part (i) of his request, but did not accept its refusal under section 40(2) of FOIA to disclose the information sought in part (ii). 8. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Cabinet Office maintained its reliance on section 40(2), but sought additionally to rely on section 41(1) (information provided in confidence), to refuse part (ii) of the request. The Commissioner’s Decision 9. For the reasons set out in his Decision Notice, the Commissioner made the following findings. 10. First, the Commissioner found that the information was exempt from disclosure under section 41(1). 11. In relation to the exemption in section 41(1), it was necessary to consider whether the information was obtained by the Cabinet Office from a third party, and clearly it was. As to whether disclosure would constitute an actionable breach of confidence, the Commissioner applied the test in Coco v A. N. Clark (Engineers) Limited [1968] FSR 415, and found that the test was met. In particular (a) the information had the necessary quality of confidence; (b) the information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and (c) the unauthorised use of the information would be of detriment to the confider. 12. As to whether the Cabinet Office would have a public interest defence were it to disclose the information, the Commissioner acknowledged that there was a public interest in being able to see how former Prime Ministers justify the allowances they claim. However, the Commissioner considered that this public interest was met by disclosure, to the public, of the total amounts claimed by former Prime Ministers under the PDCA. Knowing the minutiae of such claims would not add much of significance to the public’s understanding of this element of government spending. The Commissioner concluded that the Cabinet Office would not have a public interest defence were it to disclose the information. 13. Having reached the decision that the information was exempt from disclosure under section 41(1), the Commissioner did not consider it necessary to go on to determine whether the information was also exempt under section 40(2). However, the Commissioner considered it -4-likely that the information relating to those individuals alive at the time of the request would also be exempt under section 40(2). 14. The Commissioner also found that because of its late reliance on section 41(1), the Cabinet Office had breached section 17(1). The Appeal to the Tribunal 15. The Appellant has appealed to the First-tier Tribunal in relation to the information coming within the scope of part (ii) of his request. 16. The Appellant has requested that the appeal be determined on the papers without an oral hearing, and the Commissioner has concurred. Having regard to the nature of the issues raised, and the nature of the evidence, we have been satisfied that the appeal can properly be determined without an oral hearing. 17. We have received an open and closed bundle of documents. The closed bundle has been prepared by the Commissioner, and the Appellant has not had sight of it. We have considered all the documents received, even if not specifically referred to in this decision. 18. There has been no cross-appeal by the Cabinet Office, and it has not applied to be joined as party to this appeal. 19. Certain parts of our decision are set out in a separate Confidential Annex in order to avoid defeating the purpose of any onward appeal there might be. Issues 20. This appeal only concerns the information coming within the scope of part (ii) of the Appellant’s request (for copies of each former Prime Minister’s receipts and other supporting documentation). We will refer to this information as the Disputed Information. 21. The first issue before us is whether the Cabinet Office was entitled to withhold the Disputed Information under section 41(1) of FOIA. If it was, then that determines the appeal. 22. If it was not, then we must go on to consider whether the Cabinet Office was entitled to withhold the Disputed Information under section 40(2). The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 23. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal against the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Commissioner’s Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law, or to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, he ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute -5-such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 24. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. Findings 25. Under section 1(1)(a) of FOIA, a person who has made a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed, in writing, whether the public authority holds that information. Under section 1(1)(b), he is entitled to have that information communicated to him. 26. The duty under section 1 does not arise if any of the exemptions set out in FOIA apply. The first exemption being relied on in the present case is that contained in section 41 (information provided in confidence). 27. Section 41(1) provides as follows: “(1) Information is exempt information if - (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person.” 28. We agree with the Commissioner that the requirement of section 41(1)(a) is met because the information was clearly obtained from another person, namely from former Prime Ministers or from their staff on their behalf. We also agree that the test to be applied in relation to whether disclosure would constitute an actionable breach of confidence, is that set out in Coco v Clark. However, we do not agree that that test is met on the facts of this case. 29. We find that the information was not provided in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. The Appellant says, and we agree, that in a post FOIA era, a former Prime Minister cannot reasonably have expected that he or she could claim up to £115,000 per annum, for life, from the public purse, without the public expecting there to be transparency as to what the money is being spent on. 30. In finding otherwise, the Commissioner seems to have relied on the Cabinet Office’s assertion that the information was provided to it in strict confidence and on the understanding that it would not be disclosed. The Commissioner has said, in his Response dated 29 September 2015, that he has no reason to doubt the Cabinet Office’s explanation in this regard. The Commissioner noted that the understanding that the information -6-would be kept confidential, was evidenced, in some cases, by the inclusion of the words ‘Private and Confidential’, on the documents supplied, although the Commissioner acknowledged that this was not determinative. The Commissioner, noted however, that it is the practice for the total amounts claimed under the PDCA to be published, while a breakdown of the information is not. The Commissioner says that this supports the conclusion that the information was provided to the Cabinet Office on the understanding that it would not be disclosed. 31. In our view, no evidence has been provided to support the Cabinet Office’s assertion that the information was provided to it in confidence. There is no correspondence, protocol, memorandum of understanding or evidence of any other communication before us between the Cabinet Office and any former Prime Ministers in which the confidentiality of the information has been discussed, much less agreed. The fact that a breakdown has not previously been disclosed does not mean that the information was provided in confidence. As the Commissioner has acknowledged, the words ‘Private and Confidential’ cannot be determinative. In any event, these words appear on only one invoice, and that is for the full amount of £115,000. That amount has been disclosed, so clearly the Cabinet Office has not itself treated those words as importing an obligation of confidence. 32. Even if we are wrong about this, we find that the public interest would constitute a defence to an action for breach of confidence. The Commissioner acknowledged that there is a public interest in being able to see how former Prime Ministers use the allowances they claim. However, in the Commissioner’s view, this public interest is met by disclosure of the total amounts claimed by former Prime Ministers under the PDCA. The Commissioner considered that knowing the minutia of such claims would not add much of significance to the public’s understanding of this element of government spending. We do not agree. It is the breakdown of the expenditure that tells the public how the money is being spent, and allows them to form a view as to whether it is being spent responsibly, and in a manner that is commensurate with the public benefit, or perceived public benefit, derived from it. 33. The Commissioner has sought to distinguish the present case from Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner & Others [2008] EWHC 1084, concerning a request under FOIA for a full breakdown and supporting documents of expense claims submitted by MPs under the Parliamentary Additional Costs Allowance scheme. The Commissioner noted that a particular factor taken into account by the Tribunal in that case was that the accountability of MPs is ultimately determined by public vote at the ballot box, for which purpose electors need to be able to make informed choices. We recognise that an assessment of the public interest is of course always fact specific. However, it is self-evident that many of the public interest considerations identified in that case apply in the present case as well. We will not reiterate them all here, but would highlight that just as there is a public interest in understanding the way in which MPs’ allowances are -7-claimed, there is also a public interest in knowing what specific expenditure a former Prime Minister claims from the public purse. Just as with MPs’ expenses, the importance of transparency and accountability is heightened where, as here, the system involves self certification by the persons claiming public money. We do not agree with the Commissioner that the public interest is any the lesser because the information is not needed for the public to exercise a decision at the ballot box. On the contrary, because the allowance is claimed by those no longer holding elected office, and because the allowance can be claimed for the rest of the former Prime Ministers’ lives, whether or not they are engaged in activities that may be perceived to be of public benefit, we consider that the public interest in seeing that the use of public money is appropriate and is properly accounted for, is arguably even greater. 34. For all these reasons, we find that the Disputed Information is not exempt under section 41(1). Having reached this finding, we must go on to consider whether the Disputed Information is exempt under section 40(2). The Commissioner has addressed this in the Decision Notice only in passing (stating that it was likely that the information relating to those individuals alive at the time of the request would also be exempt under section 40(2), and that the legitimate interest in disclosure has largely been met by the publication of the overall figure claimed). The Commissioner has not applied for leave to make further submissions in the event that the Tribunal finds, as we have done, that the Disputed Information is not exempt under section 41(1). Having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 of the The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, and given that we have the benefit of the Cabinet Office’s arguments as they were made to the Commissioner in relation to section 40(2), we consider that we can deal with the issue fairly and justly without having to adjourn to seek the Commissioner’s further submissions, and the Appellant’s further reply. 35. Under section 40(2), personal data of third parties is exempt if disclosure would breach any of the data protection principles set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The exemption is absolute. 36. The Disputed Information clearly constitutes the personal data of the claimants, (the former Prime Ministers). It also contains the personal data of individuals other than the claimants. 37. The question is whether disclosure of this personal data would breach any of the data protection principles. Only the first data protection principle is relevant. This provides that personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully, and in particular, shall not be processed unless at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met. On the facts of this case, the only relevant condition in Schedule 2 is condition 6(1). 38. Condition 6(1) provides as follows: -8-The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 39. The key issues that arises from the first data protection principle, and condition 6(1), is whether disclosure would be fair, whether it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest that is being pursued, and whether it is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects. The first and last of these considerations are closely related. 40. In order to address these issues, we need briefly to describe the Disputed Information, which we consider we can do without trespassing on any content that could be said to engage either of the exemptions relied upon. 41. The Disputed Information relates to 4 former Prime Ministers, namely, Tony Blair, the late Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and Gordon Brown. The quantity of information in respect of each former Prime Minister ranges from 3 to 27 pages. The information includes one former Prime Minister’s bank account details and a personal address. It also includes (though not in all cases), the names of staff who have received payments from the former Prime Ministers’ offices, and the names of some individuals who may have been involved in preparing or submitting the claims on behalf of the former Prime Ministers, as well as individuals at the Cabinet Office who may have been involved in receiving or processing the claims. 42. In addition, there is also an item of personal data in relation to one former Prime Minister’s claim which it will be necessary to describe and deal with in the closed Annex, since to do so in the open part of this decision would effectively involve disclosing that information. 43. To summarise, the personal data in issue is that of the claimants (i.e. the former Prime Ministers), and of certain non-claimants (i.e. staff involved in making or processing the claims, as well as the individuals to whom specific payments have been made). 44. Would disclosure of this personal data be fair? When assessing fairness, the interests of the data subject as well as the data user, and where relevant, the interests of the wider public, must be taken into account in a balancing exercise. This wide approach to fairness is endorsed by the observations of Arden LJ in Johnson v Medical Defence Union [2007] EWCA Civ 262 at paragraph 141: “Recital (28) [of Directive 95/46] states that ""any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the individuals concerned"". I do not consider that this excludes from -9-consideration the interests of the data user. Indeed the very word ""fairness"" suggests a balancing of interests. In this case the interests to be taken into account would be those of the data subject and the data user, and perhaps, in an appropriate case, any other data subject affected by the operation in question.” Although that case concerned the provisions of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, the principles apply equally in relation to FOIA. 45. The following passage in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v IC and Norman Baker MP [2011] 1 Info LR 935 at paragraph 28, also offers guidance about the balancing exercise to be undertaken: “If A makes a request under FOIA for personal data about B, and the disclosure of that personal data would breach any of the data protection principles, then the information is exempt from disclosure under the Act: this follows from section 40(2) read in conjunction with section 40(3)(a)(i), or (when applicable) section 40(3)(b) which does not apply in these appeals. This is an absolute exemption - section 2(3)(f)(ii) FOIA. Hence the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure under section 2(2). However… the application of the data protection principles does involve striking a balance between competing interests, similar to (though not identical with) the balancing exercise that must be carried out in applying the public interest test where a qualified exemption is being considered.” 46. This does not mean, however, that one starts with the scales evenly balanced. The continued primacy of the DPA, notwithstanding freedom of information legislation, and the high degree of protection it affords data subjects has been strongly emphasised by Lord Hope in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] 1 WLR 1550 where he states (at paragraph 7): “In my opinion there is no presumption in favour of the release of personal data under the general obligation that [FOIA] lays down. The references which that Act makes to provisions of DPA 1998 must be understood in the light of the legislative purpose of that Act …. The guiding principle is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.” 47. Where public officials are involved and where the purpose for which the data is processed arises through the performance of a public function, the following passage in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons offers helpful guidance: “…when assessing the fair processing requirements under the DPA … the consideration given to the interests of data subjects, who are public officials where data are processed for a public - 10 -function, is no longer first or paramount. Their interests are still important, but where data subjects carry out public functions, hold elective office or spend public funds they must have the expectation that their public actions will be subject to greater scrutiny than would the case in respect of their private lives. This principle still applies even where a few aspects of their private lives are intertwined with their public lives but where the vast majority of processing of personal data relates to the data subject’s private life.” (paragraph 77): 51. As to whether disclosure is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest, “necessary”, in this context, has been held to reflect the meaning attributed to it by the European Court of Human Rights when justifying an interference with a recognised right, namely that there should be a pressing social need and that interference must be both proportionate as to the means, and fairly balanced as to ends. See Corporate Officer of the House of Commons. More recently, in Farrand v Information Commissioner and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority [2014] UKUT 0310 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal stressed that “necessary” does not mean essential or indispensable. That is too strict a test. Rather, the word connotes a degree of importance or urgency that is lower than absolute necessity, but greater than a mere desire or wish. 48. We return now to the facts of the present case. In our view, different considerations arise when dealing with the personal data of claimants as opposed to the personal data of non-claimants. 49. In relation to the former, apart from the bank account details (the disclosure of which the Appellant accepts would breach the first data protection principle), the Cabinet Office has not given any reason as to why disclosure would be unfair or would otherwise breach the first data protection principle. The total amounts claimed by the former Prime Ministers in any year, is already disclosed. We see no unfairness in disclosure of the breakdown of the claims. We consider that the Appellant is pursuing a legitimate interest (and we note that it has not been argued otherwise), and that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest. We have already discussed the wider public interest at paragraphs 32 and 33, above. We do not find that disclosure is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects. There has been no evidence or arguments put forward by the Cabinet Office in this regard. 50. We consider that the position is quite different, however, in relation to the personal data of non-claimants, namely, the members of staff involved in an administrative capacity in making or processing the claims, as well as the individuals to whom specific payments have been made. We find that disclosure of this personal data would not be fair. We do not find it likely that it would have been in the reasonable expectation of these individuals, that their personal data would be disclosed. We also consider that any legitimate interest in their personal data is tenuous. The Appellant has argued, and persuasively in our view, as to the public - 11 -interest in the breakdown of the expenditure. While we consider that for that information to be meaningful, the breakdown should be disclosed by reference to what the expenditure was for, and that there is a legitimate interest in knowing the total amount paid to any individual, in the absence of any suggestion of impropriety, we do not consider that there is a legitimate interest in disclosure of the identity of the individuals to whom payment has been made. While it may be fair to say that anyone paid from the public purse should expect some information about such payments to be public, there is no suggestion that these are individuals holding any positions of responsibility or seniority such that any legitimate interest there may be, would outweigh the prejudice to their rights and freedoms that would arise if their identities were to be disclosed. There is even less legitimate interest in disclosing the identity of the staff involved in making or processing the claims. 51. For all these reasons, we find that: (1) that part of the Disputed Information which comprises the personal data of the four former Prime Ministers is not exempt under section 40(2), and must be disclosed, except for any bank account details; and (2) that part of the Disputed Information which comprises the personal data of other individuals (including their names, personal addresses, and personal email addresses) should be anonymised and/or redacted as further specified in the Confidential Annex, before the Disputed Information is disclosed to the Appellant. 52. The Public Authority must also disclose to the Appellant the unredacted letter from Roger Smethurst dated 18 March 2015, which appears as the first item in the closed bundle. The redacted portions of that letter do not disclose any personal data which we find to be exempt. Indeed, it simply describes the Disputed Information in general terms. We see no reason why that information should have been redacted from that letter at all. Decision 53. The Appellant’s appeal is allowed in part. 54. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Date: 22 February 2016 Tribunal Judge Note: certain changes were made to the decision before promulgation in order to take account of concerns raised by the Cabinet Office that the open part of the decision disclosed some Disputed Information. 21 March 2016 - 12 -"

SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Public authority: The Crown Prosecution Service Name of Complainant: Omar Stephens The Substituted Decision (1) On request (A) the public interest in maintaining the section 30(1)(c) exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure of the information and the CPS ought to have informed Mr Stephens whether it held the information and, if so, supplied it to him; (2) On request (B) the information was properly withheld under section 30(1)(c) and no further action is required; (3) On request (C) the information was exempt from disclosure under section 40(1) of FOIA. 2Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 Action Required The CPS is required to locate and supply the information the subject of request (A) to Mr Stephens by 16.00 on 13 November 2015. HH Judge Shanks 19th October 2015 3Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 REASONS FOR DECISION Factual background 1. On 6 December 2005 the Appellant, Omar Stephens, was convicted at the Old Bailey of a murder committed on 13 October 2004. He remains a serving prisoner. Although he has already brought an unsuccessful appeal in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and applied unsuccessfully to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to review his case, he continues to maintain that he is innocent and was wrongly convicted. 2. On 20 April 2009 Mr Stephens made a wide ranging request under FOIA for information about his case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with a view to obtaining information to assist him to establish his innocence. That request ultimately came before this Tribunal (HH Judge Shanks, Mr de Waal and John Randall) and, following a hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court attended by Mr Stephens and representatives of the Information Commissioner and the CPS, the Tribunal issued a decision dated 20 December 2012 ruling that the information requested was exempt under section 30(1)(c) of FOIA (“information held by a public authority for the purposes of any criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct”) and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in the disclosure of the information. The Tribunal recorded in its decision at paragraph 16, when discussing the public interest in disclosure of the information, that the CPS had indicated that they were able and willing to provide any information to Mr Stephens which he might reasonably require in relation to a further appeal outside the terms of FOIA (ie subject to suitable undertakings by Mr Stephens as to its use). 3. On 14 May 2014 Mr Stephens made a much more focussed FOIA request for information from the CPS seeking: (A) The precise time 999 operator received the phone call from [a named witness] on 13/10/14 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 (B) All material or information that [another named witness] disclosed to the police and what was disclosed from the police to [the witness] including witness statements, audios, dialogue, welfare visits and DVDs (C) The end cell … site postcode of [his own mobile telephone] He told us in the course of the hearing of this appeal at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 15 October 2015 that the information he was seeking under requests (A) and (C) was relevant to his contention that he was not present at the scene of the murder on 13 October 2004 but that for some reason it had not featured in the evidence at his criminal trial (in relation to request (C) this appeared to be confirmed by a passage in the judge’s summing up which he showed us). The information sought under request (B) was relevant to attacking the credibility of the prosecution witness in question. He also told us in the course of the hearing (and he referred us to a letter at page 60 of the bundle which tended to support his account) that he had requested the same information from the CPS under FOIA in January 2013 and that the CPS had refused his request in reliance on section 30(1)(c) but that, although they had said that CPS London would be in touch with him in order to consider whether the information should be disclosed outside FOIA, he had not heard any more from them. 4. The CPS’s response to the request of 14 May 2014 in an email sent on 29 May 2014 was simply to refer to the Information Tribunal’s decision of 20 December 2012 which, they said, found that section 30(1)(c) applied to all the information “ … you requested from your case …” and to say that there was nothing further the writer could add and that he was unable to correspond further with Mr Stephens on the matter. It is noteworthy that the CPS did not expressly state whether they held the information requested on 14 May 2014 as required by section 1(1)(a) of FOIA, although it seems that it has been tacitly assumed throughout the case that such information is likely to be available on the CPS files, and we are satisfied on balance that it will be. 5. Mr Stephens applied to the Information Commissioner under section 50 and he upheld the CPS’s position in a decision notice dated 16 April 2015. Mr Stephens appealed against that decision notice and we have held a hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court. 5Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 Mr Stephens represented himself in a restrained and sensible way and the Commissioner was ably represented by Ms Emmerson. It seems that the CPS did not apply to be joined to the appeal and we have not heard directly from them on this occasion. Our conclusions on the appeal 6. Although Mr Stephens seemed at one point to be trying to persuade us otherwise, we have no doubt that any information held by the CPS which comes within the terms of his request is covered by section 30(1)(c) of FOIA. The only matter for us to consider in relation to that exemption is therefore whether in all the circumstances the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed that in disclosure of the information. 7. We were referred to paragraphs 11 to 18 of the decision of 20 December 2012 where the Tribunal discussed the public interest balance in relation to section 30(1)(c) in the context of the requests for information made by Mr Stephens in 2009 and we see no reason to revise the general remarks made in those paragraphs, which can be read into this decision. However, in the (very) particular circumstances of this case, having regard to the terms of the requests and the circumstances as they were in May 2014, we have come to the view on this occasion that the public interest balance fell in favour of disclosure of the information which was the subject of requests (A) and (C), although not in the case of the information the subject of request (B). 8. The factors which have led us to that conclusion in relation to requests (A) and (C) are these: (1) Obviously, a wrong or unfair conviction for murder would be a matter of great public disquiet, as well as disquiet to Mr Stephens. Although we are no nearer to being able to conclude that there really is any basis for saying that there may have been a wrong or unfair conviction in this case than we were in 2012, we cannot help but note Mr Stephens’s continuing persistence in protesting his innocence. Further, on this occasion, he has at 6Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 least identified some specific material which he says will undermine the jury’s implicit finding that he was present when the murder took place. This factor therefore weighed more heavily in 2014 than it did in 2012. (2) The existence of the CPS’s undertaking to supply information outside FOIA if appropriate was a factor which tended to lessen the public interest in disclosure under FOIA. However, as we have mentioned, at least on Mr Stephens’s account of events, it does not appear that he in fact received much co-operation from the CPS between 2012 and 2014. (3) The information requested is very focussed. It will not undermine the position of any witness. If available it will be as near to objective fact as can be. We cannot see any reason why the information should be sensitive. All these are points which tend to lessen the public interest in maintaining the exemption in relation to the specific information requested. (4) By the time of the refusal to supply the information with which we are concerned 8 ½ years had passed since Mr Stephens’s trial (as opposed to 5 ½ years the last time): the public interest in maintaining the exemption inevitably lessens over time. 9. Although we therefore conclude that section 30(1)(c) did not entitle the CPS to withhold the information the subject of request (C), we also noted that it appears to be tacitly assumed all around that if this information is held by the CPS it must comprise Mr Stephen’s personal data since it is information as to his whereabouts (or the whereabouts of his mobile phone) at a certain time. It would therefore be absolutely exempt from disclosure under section 40(1) of FOIA and should probably have been dealt with as a subject access request under the Data Protection Act 1998. We therefore substitute a finding to this effect. 10. As to request (B), different considerations apply. The information requested relates to a specific witness who Mr Stephens seeks to discredit. It seems to us that the public interest in maintaining the section 30(1) exemption is substantially weightier in relation to such information because its disclosure is likely to be contrary to the 7Appeal No: EA/2015/0134 witness’s expectations, may create real danger for the witness and would have had a seriously deterrent effect on other witnesses in future. In our view, these considerations tipped the balance in favour of maintaining the exemption in relation to request (B) and the CPS and the Commissioner were right to so conclude. Disposal 11. We have therefore concluded that request (A) was not dealt with in accordance with FOIA and that request (C) ought to have been refused on the basis of section 40(1) rather than section 30(1)(c) FOIA (and probably considered as a subject access request under the Data Protection Act 1998). To that extent we allow the appeal and we issue a substituted decision notice reflecting these conclusions. 12. Our decision is unanimous. HH Judge Shanks Date: 19th October 2015 8"

Judge and Jean Nelson and Michael Hake Tribunal Members 1Date of Decision: 24th. August, 2015 Date of Promulgation: 7th September 2015 The appeal was determined on written submissions. Subject matter: Whether the request for information was vexatious within FOIA s.14(1) Authority Dransfield v ICO and Devon County Council and other appeals [2015] EWCA Civ. 454 Abbreviations FOIA The Freedom of Information Act 2000 The ICO The Information Commissioner The DN The Decision Notice DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal finds that the request was not vexatious. It requires Leybourne Parish Council to respond to it within 20 days of the publication of this Decision. Dated this 24th. day of August, 2015 David Farrer Q.C. Judge 2[Signed on original] REASONS FOR DECISION The Background 1. The Appellant (“GR”), lives within the civil parish of Leybourne, Kent. For some time he and his mother have disputed with Leybourne Parish Council (“LPC”) the use of a strip of land in the village leased by LPC from the District Council. LPC wishes to leave it as a nature reserve; GR and others want it to be maintained as mown grassland, the footpath which runs through it kept free of brambles, nettles and other natural obstructions. GR has cleared weeds and rubble from this land and caused Kent County Council (“KCC”) to cut back undergrowth and mow the edges of sections of the footpath. LPC has asserted that such maintenance was and remains too costly, given its financial resources. 2. Such disagreements led to a series of hostile exchanges between GR and LPC or its members. It appears, however, that most, if not all the events to which LPC specifically referred when justifying to the ICO its eventual decision to rely on FOIA s.14 post - dated the request of 1st. July, 2014 which gives rise to this appeal. They involved - (i) allegedly disruptive conduct by GR at two Parish Council meetings; (ii) intimidating contact with the Parish clerk; (iii) harassment of a site manager and (iv) the setting - up by GR of Facebook and Twitter accounts, masquerading as LPC accounts said by LPC to contain offensive, even defamatory comments about LPC. (v) the unauthorised removal of roots and undergrowth from the strip of land by GR and his mother. 33. These activities led to police investigation of the Facebook and Twitter accounts (which did not result in any charge) and an order from KCC excluding GR from the LPC offices and a play area for 12 months. Other than a fairly innocuous transcript of exchanges at an LPC meeting, no evidence in support of these disputed complaints was before the Tribunal. Their relevance is assessed in paragraphs 26 - 29. The Request 3. At an LPC meeting on 3rd. June, 2014 GR asked why the footpaths were not kept clear of brambles, nettles etc. He was evidently told that LPC did not have the money to do this. 4. On 1st. July, 2014 he made the following request for information - “Under the Freedom of Information Act, 2000, would you kindly supply me, within the next 20 working days, a copy of the Leybourne Parish Council’s FULL income and expenditure accounts for each month over the last five years, beginning April, 2009. and including June and July, 2014, by means of a stick, chip or email.” It was apparently delivered at the LPC meeting that day. 4. LPC replied within 20 days refusing the request on the ground of cost. A similar request dated 6th. August, 2014 elicited a more detailed response dated 17th. September, 2014, citing s.12 of FOIA and setting out the technical problems involved in satisfying the re- quest and the statutory and accounting duties duties of LPC. GR had complained to the ICO following receipt of the first refusal. 5. On 9th. December, 2014 LPC informed the ICO that it now relied on s.14 rather than s.12. The DN proceeded on the basis that s.14 was the sole ground of refusal to be considered and so does this Decision. 46. As observed above, several incidents identified in paragraph 2 above and now relied upon as evidence of the vexatious nature of the request had occurred in the interval be- tween the request and the issue of the DN on 24th. February, 2015, indeed before LPC’s change of stance. The DN 7. The ICO noted the switch to reliance on s.14. He observed that s.12 could not be success- fully relied on because costs of formatting and redaction could not be included in the computation of the cost of satisfying the request. He accepted, nevertheless, that the overall cost could be considered in the assessment of the burden imposed by the request for the purposes of s.14. which, having regard to LPC’s circumstances, was “great”. He recited the incidents referred to in paragraph 2, which he evidently interpreted adversely to GR as indicating some kind of obsessive campaign. He accepted that GR had a serious purpose in making the request but concluded that the burden imposed on LPC and the matters summarised above rendered it vexatious. He therefore upheld LPC’s refusal to respond. GR appealed. GR’s case on appeal 8. The core of his submissions was that his request had a serious purpose and sought infor- mation which ought to be available to any taxpayer in a democratic society. More spe- cifically, he wanted LPC to maintain footpaths, trees and shrubbery to a proper stan- dard; LPC said that it could not afford to do so. GR wished to check this claim by seeing how it spent its income, given that there was no accessible public record of its income and expenditure, whether in published minutes or elsewhere. Furthermore, he had ob- served apparent discrepancies in records of payments to LPC which justified an ex- amination of the accounts requested. 9. He refuted LPC’s interpretation of the events listed in paragraph 2, argued that most of its complaints were exaggerated and denied any campaign of disruption. He had made no 5previous FOIA requests. He did not accept that the burden of compliance was disproportionate. He would be prepared to modify his request to some degree to facilitate compliance The case for the ICO 10. In his Response the ICO reiterated the conclusions of the DN. He accepted some serious purpose in the request but considered that it was outweighed by the burden of satisfying it, taken in the context of surrounding events and the history of dealings between LPC and GR. As to LPC’s argument as to the relevant history he stated more than once that he had “no reason to doubt” LPC’s statement or comments on a disputed issue. He evi- dently accepted LPC’s case as to these features of its dealings with GR and relied on it in support of his decision. The reasons for the Tribunal’s decision 11. We have regard to two important observations (underlined) of Arden L.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Dransfield v ICO and Devon County Council and other appeals [2015] EWCA Civ. 454 at paragraph 68 - “ - - - I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right.”. We therefore start by asking ourselves whether there was a reasonable foundation for the claim that the information would have value for GR and by reminding ourselves that proof of vexatiousness requires cogent evidence. 612. We have no doubt that GR had a serious purpose in making the request. Whatever the correct view of subsequent events, he wanted to verify claims as to financial constraints which, rightly or wrongly, he viewed with scepticism. He also believed, that there was a discrepancy in figures relating to a Lottery Fund grant. His motive was not, in our judgement, simply to harass or disrupt the work of LPC. If he subsequently used the re- quested information to criticise or attempt to discredit councillors, then that is his right and their vulnerability in a democratic society. This is not a case of speculative “fishing” for damaging information. 13. Furthermore, his request was not one which he should have supposed to be exorbitant or burdensome when he made it. There is no evidence that he knew the complex history of LPC’s electronic records, hence that his request would make heavy demands on its re- sources, assuming that to be the case. A local resident may well expect that records of the kind requested would be held in accessible form even by a parish council of modest size. This was a request which had “a reasonable foundation” to quote Arden L.J.. 14. LPC provided a full account of its financial functions and accounting procedures in its letter to GR of 17th. September, 2014. The description of procedures appears to convey the message that existing audit checks and publication of Annual Returns are a sufficient guarantee of the propriety and efficiency of LPC’s discharge of its financial responsibili- ties so that GR’s request, regardless of other objections, was superfluous. If that implication was intended, it was misconceived. A local taxpayer is entitled to see for himself, within reason, what income his parish council receives and how it is spent. 15. LPC identified two problems which increased the burden of responding to GR’s request, namely a succession of different persons maintaining its books and the use of a series of mutually incompatible software systems/ file formats. It stressed the burden of complying with the requirements of LPC’s own financial regulations as to scrutiny of payments and signatures on LPC cheques and the consequent safeguards against error or malpractice. Why the discharge of such duties should, of itself, aggravate the task of responding to GR’s request is not apparent. Indeed the procedures described, involving the presentation 7to the Finance Committee of a monthly list of cheques for approval and payment seem to provide a source for a major part of the information which RG seeks. 16. The Tribunal bears in mind that this letter was written in support of a reliance on the cost exemption provided for by s.12 of FOIA, not s.14. However, it is notable that it contained no estimate of the expected volume of work entailed in answering the request but rather a detailed account of prescribed procedures and an emphatic assertion of excessive cost. It indicates that the records relating to the financial year ending in April, 2010 are in- accessible due to the use of unidentifiable software. 17. The DN contains later calculations, apparently made by the ICO, as to the time required to answer this request. They arrive at a full week’s work for the Parish Clerk. 18. Clearly, this request demanded a substantial use of LPC’s resources; hence compliance would impose on LPC a significant burden, though, as already observed, that would not have been obvious to the requester. LPC asserts that its routine work and work on par- ticular projects has already been disrupted by dealing with the request and with GR’s ac- tivities more generally. We address the latter aspect of this appeal at paragraph 28. As to work undertaken so far in direct response to the request, that amounts to five and a half hours, five for the “initial search” and thirty minutes to extract, redact and reformat two spreadsheets for one month according to the DN (see paragraphs 18, 19 and 20). Even allowing for some additions to that estimate of time spent (provided by LPC), it would be implausible to attribute to such a commitment the wrecking of LPC’s work programme described at paragraph 21 of the DN. The lack of a permanent Parish Clerk is a far more probable source of such problems. 19. A striking feature of the LPC response of 17th. September, 2014 and of the DN is the absence of any reference to s.16 of FOIA or s.45 and the relevant Code of Practice. FOIA s.16 provides - “(1) It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who 8propose to make or have made requests for information to it. (2) Any public authority which, in relation to the provision of advice or assistance in any case, conforms with the code of practice under s.45 is to be taken to comply with the duty imposed by subsection(1) in relation to that case.” Paragraphs 8 - 11 of the 2004 Code relate to “Clarifying the request”. This request, if those words are narrowly construed, required no clarification but it is evident that the term covers cases where the request might, with the authority’s assistance, be reduced to a manageable scope without seriously restricting the requester’s access to the in- formation critical to the request. Paragraph 10 includes “providing an outline of the dif- ferent kinds of information which might meet the terms of the request” and concludes with the words “This list is not exhaustive and public authorities should be flexible in of- fering advice and assistance most appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant”. Quite apart from the Code, assistance in the refinement of a request to meet the limitations of the authority’s resources was plainly envisaged by Parliament when s.16(1) was enacted. 20. Making due allowance for the modest resources of LPC, this was a case in which it could reasonably be expected to offer such assistance to GR both in his and in LPC’s interests. In the letter of 17th. September, 2014, LPC set out its problems and systems but ended, not with a suggestion that discussion of the scope of the request might assist GR in ob- taining what he wanted but with the uncompromising statements that the cost of re- sponse would be excessive, the request was declined and LPC had “exhausted its procedures in this matter.” It may be that LPC councillors were not in a mood to offer assistance by September, 2014, due to deteriorating relations with GR. That does not absolve LPC from compliance with s.16 however. 21. It is surprising that the ICO still made no reference to s. 16 in his Response to the Grounds of Appeal. 922. The purpose of GR’s request, which, the Tribunal accepts, was a matter as to which LPC could not question him, suggests that compromise was possible, consistently with GR’s targets. Whether such assistance would have resolved the problems of disclosure, the Tribunal cannot say, though GR’s subsequent stance suggests a willingness to modify his requirements in the interests of obtaining relevant information. Be that as it may, such as- sistance was not offered, despite the very modest burden of work that it would have in- volved. 23. The Tribunal finds that LPC breached s.16 in its initial response, its subsequent letter of 17th. September, 2014 and further correspondence up to and including its letter of 9th. December, 2014 invoking s.14. In our view, that breach is relevant to the claim as to a disproportionate burden. 24. We turn now to what the DN refers to as “The background”, that is to say events subsequent to the request and continuing up to the issue of the DN. 25. Their relevance is said to be that they provide context for the request and shed light on the nature of and motivation for that request. GR was conducting an obsessive campaign to discredit councillors. 26. An unusual feature of such context is that all or virtually all of the events cited postdate the request. Furthermore, only one of them involves any kind of communication with LPC on the general subject matter of expenditure and that was a brief intervention at a meeting, not a lengthy FOIA request. 27. Clearly, subsequent events may shed light on the bona fides of a requester but caution is needed in deciding how far, if at all, they assist in determining the reasonable foundation of the antecedent request. If, looking at all the surrounding evidence, a request was reasonable at the time it was made, subsequent misconduct, especially misconduct which does not involve communication with the authority, cannot transform it into a vexatious request. 1028. In this appeal, assuming in favour of LPC and the ICO, that subsequent events reflect adversely on GR, it is far from clear how the removal of brambles, the following of a site manager, offensive conduct towards the Parish Clerk or posting offensive lampoons on social media demonstrate that the July request was valueless, motivated by spite, ob- sessive or unreasonably burdensome. The time involved in reacting to such oc- currences has no bearing on the burden or disruption said to be caused by the request. The referring of the social media activities to the City of London fraud squad and the making of an exclusion order, apparently without giving its subject a chance to be heard, might suggest that LPC was itself engaging in disproportionate responses. 29. The nature and timing of these events, assuming that they occurred just as stated by LPC and accepted by the ICO would have very little significance in the Tribunal’s assessment of the vexatiousness of the request. “Vexatiousness” imposes a high hurdle of proof on the public authority. 30. However, a further objection to attributing importance to such matters is the fact that, though the ICO and LPC were aware that LPC’s account of what took place and its in- terpretation were strongly disputed by GR, as noted above at paragraph 9, there is no evi- dence before the Tribunal from the ICO or LPC as to any of these events. There is not even a statement from the ICO that he has heard from both sides and prefers the evidence of LPC. He merely observes at paragraphs 29 and 44 of his Response that he “has no reason to doubt” statements and comments made by LPC. He does not indicate what reasons he has to doubt the contradictory statements of GR in his Grounds of Appeal as to every one of the cited events. 31. Where a party, here the ICO, intends to rely in support of his case on appeal on matters which he knows to be disputed, then he must adduce evidence in the form of witness statements upon which the makers can be cross - examined, and require an oral hearing. Any excess of such evidence can be trimmed off by direction of the Registrar. It is unthinkable that, on a material issue, the Tribunal should act without more on a disputed 11and significant statement of fact, especially where both sides advance reasonably plausible versions of what occurred. 32. We do not adjourn this appeal for such evidence to be tendered because, as indicated at paragraph 29, a resolution of the conflicting versions would not affect our decision. 33. We find that this request had a reasonable foundation and that the burden of compliance could well have been reduced by agreement, if LPC had had regard to s.16. It was not vexatious. 34. For these reasons we allow this appeal. 35 Our decision is unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 24th. August, 2015 12"

Action Required The Council release the redacted information within 35 days. Dated this 20th day of August 2015 Judge Hughes [Signed on original] 2Appeal No: EA/2015/0078 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. On 14 August 2014 the Appellant in these proceedings (“Mr Higham”) requested information from the Second Respondent (“the Council”) under the heading “16M turbine investment programme” he sought information about the decision-making process and specifically asked in the following terms:- “I attach a Freedom of Information request from myself and [name redacted] representing Cornwall Protect for the most complete available financial statement of the business case for the above Council turbine investment programme. As you see a suitable format if available is that used for the earlier B 15M Solar Energy programme spread over 25 years…” 2. The Council focussed on the financial information request and resisted the request citing the protection of commercial interests. On review it concluded that the request should have been considered under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) but came to essentially the same conclusion, that the information should be withheld relying on Regulation 12(5)(e) that the disclosure would adversely affect:- “the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest” 3. Mr Higham complained to the First Respondent (“the Commissioner”). The Commissioner focussed his inquiry on the request for the business case and in his decision notice concluded that the information relating to proposals to develop wind turbines to provide electricity for sale was information of a commercial or industrial nature (DN paragraph 8). 4. He concluded that the information was the costs estimates and forecasted financial details relating to a number of proposed developments which would be used as the basis for a tendering process. The council staff would be aware of the need to keep the information secret as the disclosure of the information would have a significant effect on the tendering. It would enable those tendering to have a commercial advantage in dealing with the council by structuring their tenders in a way to win the contract while maximising their profits at the expense of the Council. He considered 3Appeal No: EA/2015/0078 that this was a weighty argument and that the information was confidential and confidentiality protected the Council’s legitimate interests of safeguarding the taxpayer. He was satisfied that the Council would be disadvantaged in the tendering exercise if the information was revealed (DN 9-25). 5. In weighing the public interest he noted the presumption in favour of disclosure and the value of enabling better scrutiny of the Council’s decision. He acknowledged Mr Higham’s argument for the need for transparency for a substantial project with contracts lasting 25 years. Disclosure would enable the public to better understand the Council’s decisions if they were armed with the anticipated costs and benefits of the project. He further noted that while the public would be able to participate in the planning process for each turbine site they would not be able to address the overall economics, merely the siting of the turbines. He also noted that the planning and policy arguments about siting of the turbines or the need for renewable energy would not be assisted by the disclosure. 6. He concluded that the prejudice to the Council in terms of the costs arising from the disclosure outweighed the public interest in transparency (DN paragraph 47). “Ultimately, providing proof that the financial proposals are appropriate before submitting the development for tender would be likely to lead to the same project costing taxpayers more” He upheld the decision of the Council to withhold the information. The appeal to the Tribunal 7. In his appeal Mr Higham disputed the commercial sensitivity of the information he has requested. He argued that “The central point is that no commercial body or competitive developer could conceivably use a broad, out-of-date financial aggregation of 7 different site projects as a negotiating lever in one of them.” He noted that his request for information about the decision-making process, had not been addressed by the Council or the Commissioner. He argued that the tendering process would not be affected by the disclosure of the business case. 8. The Commissioner resisted the appeal relying on his decision notice and explaining that the Council did not hold the summary information which Mr Higham sought; but rather held information whose disclosure would cause prejudice. 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0078 9. In its reply the Council explained that it did not hold summary information in the form requested by Mr Higham. He had been provided with such information for a previous project relating to solar power after it had been completed when the commercial sensitivities were considerably less. The information which the Council held concerning the wind turbine project covered a small number of sites and that disclosure, even if aggregated would give such information as to the overall financial viability as would assist potential tenderers and prejudice the Council. 10. In his reply to this Mr Higham again affirmed is view of the importance of disclosing the financial information and the need for wider scrutiny beyond the Council. He argued that the aggregated information of the costs across all the sites identified should be made available. Consideration 11. The withheld information is a report entitled “Green Cornwall Wind Energy Programme Stage 2A Cost Report of various sites throughout Cornwall for Cornwall Council”. The bulk of the report is detailed schedules of costings for each site, the introductory part of the report sets the scene and various assumptions underpinning the process of developing the costs. 12. Mr Higham’s request was for “the most complete available business case” for the project and the Council has correctly identified this document as a complete business case. The document clearly matches the request. Although Mr Higham has claimed that what he had in mind when he made his request was a briefer document similar to what he had already been provided for the solar energy project; what he asked for was a complete business case. The withheld information is clearly within the scope of the request. Furthermore there is no obligation on the Council to carry out processing to produce some derivative form of the information that it holds into one which would no longer risk causing commercial harm. What has to be considered is the information actually held by the Council. 13. The tribunal was in no doubt that the Council’s concerns were entirely legitimate and that disclosure of the information requested would cause serious prejudice to the Council. The tribunal is further satisfied that the Commissioner in carrying out his investigation correctly identified the issues, weighed them and correctly concluded that disclosure of this information at the time it was requested was not in the public 5Appeal No: EA/2015/0078 interest. However while that analysis is true of the report as a whole and in particular the schedules relating to specific costs the argument has considerably less force when applied to the introductory pages of the report. The cost commentary and the various broad assumptions and descriptions of processes are of use to the public in understanding the project and are not the details which would assist potential tenderers in structuring their tenders to the Council’s disadvantage. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that, subject to certain redactions, the first 7 numbered pages should be disclosed. Redactions 14. The figure in 2.06. 15. The commercial entities identified in 4.01.1 – 4.01.4, 6.07 Conclusion and remedy 16. The appeal is allowed in part. 17. The Council has 14 days to identify any further matters in the first 7 numbered pages where the disclosure would cause harm and to apply to the tribunal for redaction of that information. 18. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 20 August 2015 6"

Mr Marc Owen Jones (the Appellant) is a PhD candidate at the School of Government and International Affairs at Durham University. His area of specialist study examines political repression in Bahrain. He has published a number of articles and papers on this topic. He is particularly interested in scrutinising the British role – both historical and contemporary – in relation to Bahrain and has conducted a substantial amount of archival search in respect of this. 2. On 10 June 2013 he asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) I am writing respectfully to request the release of a retained section of a report entitled ‘Bahrain: Internal Political Situation 1977’ – File No. NBB014/1. The National Archives record for this retained extract is FCO 8 2827 [subsequently clarified on 17 June 2013 as 8 2872] Folio 4. I believe the piece concerns a conversation between DE Tatham and the head of Bahrain’s Special Branch. It was dated 1st December 1977. 3. He received a response on 8 July 2013 explaining that the FCO considered that section 27 Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), a qualified exemption, was engaged in relation to the requested information but stating that the FCO needed an additional 20 working days to consider the balance of the public interest test. The FCO sent their reply on 2 August 2013 stating that the requested information remained sensitive under section 27(1)(a) and that the United Kingdom’s bilateral relations with countries in the Gulf region would be compromised if the information was released. 4. The Appellant asked for an internal review of the decision on 4 August 2013 and had to chase this request on 11 January 2014 because there -3-had been no response from the FCO. Having received no response, he contacted the FCO for a third time on 13 February 2014 and received an acknowledgement the same day advising that they would aim to respond in 20 working days. He contacted the FCO for a fourth time on 31 March 2014 asking for an update on the status of the review as 45 days had now elapsed. 5. The Appellant contacted the Commissioner on 16 April 2014. He was dissatisfied with the FCO’s failure to commence an internal review in response to his emails dated 4 August 2013 and 11 January 2014. 6. After the Commissioner began to investigate the Appellant’s complaint the FCO provided the Appellant with a response to the internal review dated 8 May 2014. The FCO maintained that the requested information was still exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 27 (1) (a) FOIA. 7. In May 2014, the Appellant made a further complaint to the Commissioner in relation to the FCO’s decision to withhold information. 8. On 20 June 2014, the FCO provided the Appellant with a redacted copy of the information and maintained that the redacted information was exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 27 (1) (a) FOIA and that some of the information was also covered by section 40 (2) and 40(3). 9. The substance of this appeal relates to the redacted information that was withheld by the FCO on the basis of section 27(1) (a) and the potential damage to international relations. The section states: s.27 International Relations (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (a) relations between the United Kingdom and any other State, (b) relations between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or international court, (c) the interests of the United Kingdom abroad, or (d) the promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of its interests abroad. -4-(2) Information is also exempt information if it is confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom or from an international organisation or international court. (3) For the purposes of this section, any information obtained from a State, organisation or court is confidential at any time while the terms on which it was obtained require it to be held in confidence or while the circumstances in which it was obtained make it reasonable for the State, organisation or court to expect that it will be so held. (4) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a)— (a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1), or (b) would involve the disclosure of any information (whether or not already recorded) which is confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom or from an international organisation or international court. (5) In this section— “international court” means any international court which is not an international organisation and which is established— (a) by a resolution of an international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member, or (b) by an international agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party; “international organisation” means any international organisation whose members include any two or more States, or any organ of such an organisation; “State” includes the government of any State and any organ of its government, and references to a State other than the United Kingdom include references to any territory outside the United Kingdom. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 10. The FCO maintained to the Commissioner that disclosing the redacted information would – rather than simply being likely to – damage its relations with Bahrain. It argued that, despite its age, even information dating back to 1977 could have this effect when taken into account by the respective States considering their current relationship. 11. The Commissioner considered that, for prejudice-based exemptions like section 27 (1) (a) to be engaged, three criteria needed to be met: -5-(1) The actual harm which the public authority alleged would, or would be likely, to occur if the withheld information was disclosed had to relate to the applicable interests within the relevant exemption; (2) The public authority had to be able to demonstrate some causal relationship existed between the potential disclosure of the information being withheld and the prejudice which the exemption was designed to protect. In addition, the resultant prejudice that was alleged had to be real, actual or of substance; and (3) It was necessary to establish whether the level of likelihood of prejudice being relied on by the public authority was met – i.e. disclosure “would be likely” to result in prejudice or disclosure “would” result in prejudice. In relation to the lower threshold the Commissioner considered that the chance of prejudice occurring had to be more than a hypothetical possibility; there had to be a real and significant risk. With regard to the higher threshold that placed a stronger evidential burden on the public authority. The anticipated prejudice had to be more likely than not. 12. The Commissioner accepted that the potential prejudice to the UK’s relations with Bahrain fell within interests that the exemption was designed to protect, that there was a causal link between the potential disclosure of the withheld information and the exemption which was real and of substance and that disclosure could result in making relations more difficult and that – in the circumstances of the case – the higher threshold of likelihood was met in terms of prejudice to the U.K.’s relations with Bahrain. He emphasised that, having considered the information, he had fully taken into account that the requested document dated from 1977. 13. Because section 27 was a qualified exemption, the Commissioner went on to apply the public interest test to see whether – in all the circumstances of the case – the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information. 14. In terms of maintaining the exemption the FCO had argued that it was clearly against the public interest to harm the UK’s ability to maintain effective bilateral relations with countries in the Gulf region, such as Bahrain, with whom the UK had enjoyed a stable and strong relationship as a trading and regional partner. The FCO had pointed out that it was providing an extensive programme of technical and diplomatic assistance in support of the reform programme Bahrain had embarked on since the -6-unrest in 2011. The FCO had argued that its ability to provide such a level of reform assistance was based on the strong relations, trust and confidence the UK had established with Bahrain. There were significant British defence interests in Bahrain which acted as an amenable host to the Royal Navy and RAF. Any impact on the UK’s relationship with Bahrain could harm UK interests in other areas such as immigration and consular services where British interests required – or would benefit from – Bahraini assistance. 15. In terms of disclosing the information, the FCO acknowledged that it would add to the public’s understanding of, and knowledge on, the subject. It accepted that there was a public interest in a greater understanding of the UK’s foreign relations and the information could also aid the better historical understanding of Britain’s conduct. 16. The Appellant had referenced involvement of British colonial forces in the torture of Kenyans during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s. That was relevant because the requested document was a record of the meeting with the late Ian Henderson who, in 1977, was the Head of the Bahrain Special Branch. Prior to that, Mr Henderson had served as a colonial police officer in Kenya in the 1950s and was directly involved in the suppression of the Mau Mau uprising. 17. In 2000 it had been announced that the British government had launched an investigation into allegations about Mr Henderson’s complicity in the torture of detainees and prisoners in Bahrain. The investigation was dropped in 2001 and Mr Henderson had always firmly denied the allegations. 18. The Appellant explained that, given that context, he was concerned that important evidence was being withheld about the possibility of British complicity in egregious human rights acts against Bahraini subjects 19. . The Commissioner concluded that, in the light of the considerable and notable weight to be attributed to the public interest in avoiding prejudice to the UK’s relations with Bahrain, the public interest in maintaining the -7-exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosing the redacted information. The appeal to the Tribunal 20. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal made the following points in summary: (1) The Commissioner had not asked the Appellant for more detail about his reasons for seeking the information. If he had been asked he would have explained that the background related to Ian Henderson who had been accused of torture directly and indirectly by a number of Bahrainis and that the allegations were investigated by the British police. (2) The Appellant was seeking disclosure of the document because it concerned the internal security situation in Bahrain and covered a meeting between Mr Henderson and an FCO official David Tatham. The Appellant believed that the unredacted document might have important information relating to Mr Henderson’s role and his activities in Bahrain. Information already released alluded to serious issues within the Security Services and the unredacted material could shed more light on the reasons for that, since such issues could have contributed to abuses in Bahrain. In 1977 there were 11 British police officers including Mr Henderson in Bahrain and the UK clearly had a role in events in Bahrain. (3) The Appellant believed that Mr Henderson knew important information that should probably have been passed on to specific authorities, some of which had since been released. There might be unknown important episodes in the redacted information which were not yet known to the public (4) The Appellant submitted that, on grounds of procedural fairness, he had not been given the opportunity to respond to any of the reasons given by the FCO before the Commissioner came to his conclusion. He maintained that the Commissioner’s decision lacked sufficient information and was procedurally unfair and asked that -8-more information be released or fuller reasons given for it being withheld so that he could properly respond to the refusal. (5) The Appellant maintained that the Commissioner had not applied the correct approach to the public interest test. To suggest that disclosing the full record of a conversation which had taken place nearly 40 years ago – where one of the parties was now deceased – would damage the extremely close and durable relationship between Bahrain the UK which had lasted for decades was “completely absurd”. (6) In terms of the public interest favouring the disclosure of the information there were two particular factors that were highlighted. (7) The first related to the transparency and accountability of the actions of the British Government in relation to Bahrain. Britain had a long history of close relations with Bahrain against a background of allegations of egregious human rights abuses including torture and extra-judicial executions. There was public concern that the British Government had insulated the Government of Bahrain from criticism, and may have concealed evidence of serious wrong- doing. Although the Appellant was a British citizen he was concerned that citizens of Bahrain also had an interest in the transparency and accountability of their respective governments on this issue. (8) The second factor related to the removal of a plausible suspicion of wrongdoing which applied in relation both to Mr Henderson and the UK government officials in the case. The Appellant believed that evidence could shed light on questions of complicity by these actors – or otherwise in egregious acts – against citizens of Bahrain. The information could have the potential to remove the plausible suspicion of wrongdoing while matters were still within collective memory but at a time period sufficiently far removed to reduce embarrassment to those involved. Evidence -9-21. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from Mr Edward Oakden and from the Appellant. The Tribunal was able to ask questions of the former in both the open and the closed sections of the appeal hearing and of the Appellant during the open session. 22. Mr Oakden adopted his statement dated 13 February 2015 and gave his evidence as a senior diplomat based at the FCO and Director of the Middle East, a post he had held since August 2013. He had joined the FCO the 1981 and had worked in various posts both in and outside the Middle East including as British Ambassador to the UAE in 2006 – 2010. He had extensive experience of Middle Eastern matters. 23. His evidence given at the open portion of the appeal was to the effect that the extent to which HM Government had the trust and support of the Bahraini Government directly affected its ability to achieve national defence interests both within Bahrain and the wider region. Defence cooperation was a key pillar of the bilateral relationship and there was successful cooperation across a range of other areas including human rights and political reform assistance, security and counter-terrorism, trade and investment. 24. Bahrain was a generous host of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, providing basing and overflight rights free of charge. In December 2014, the Foreign Secretary signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Bahrain to establish a more permanent naval base in Bahrain, which the King had agreed to fund. The new agreement provided improved facilities for UK Royal Navy personnel and allowed the UK to expand its operational effectiveness in a volatile region and would provide for the future a forward base for naval operations. 25. If the Bahraini authorities concluded that confidential information exchanged during the course of UK reform assistance projects could now be released, they could be less inclined to continue to accept such assistance. This had happened in other countries. Disclosure of material would then cause damage to the UK’s initiatives to enhance human rights, - 10 -civil liberties and good governance at a time when the UK was providing increasingly sensitive assistance on police reform in the security sector. 26. He maintained in cross-examination – and in the closed evidence that he gave to the Tribunal – that the information withheld, despite its age, could still be harmful to relations between the UK government and Bahrain. Also the concerns of one Gulf state were keenly felt by others in the region. 27. The Appellant adopted his written witness statement dated 28 November 2014 as the foundation for his oral evidence. 28. In terms of the political and historical context he pointed out that British officials had admitted to using violent methods to extract confessions. Charles Belgrave, a British official who worked in Bahrain between 1926 and 1957 (and his multiple roles included financial adviser to the Ruler, commandant of the police and judge) used torture on detainees in a number of high-profile cases as did his British colleague Captain Parke. Methods included beatings, sleep deprivation and on one occasion the placing of lighted pieces of paper between the toes of the detainee. Officers like these shielded the Al Khalifa family from justice when they committed egregious acts. 29. After leaving Kenya where he had a role in combating the Mau Mau insurgency, Mr Henderson became Bahrain’s Head of Security in 1966 and retired in 2000. In 1971, following Bahrain’s independence, death by torture appeared to increase. Between 1976 and 1986 eight people died in police custody. During the 1990s, British officials including Mr Henderson still worked in the Bahrain security forces. The Metropolitan police had conducted an investigation into allegations of torture against Mr Henderson and, in February 2008, they concluded that there was no realistic prospect of conviction. 30. One of the reasons he was pursuing the appeal was because he believed that transparency about the events was key to healing fractures in Bahraini society and achieving reconciliation. That was especially the case with those events that had happened over 30 years ago and which could - 11 -potentially shed light on the problems inherent with Bahrain security services which the British government was reportedly helping to reform. 31. He did not believe that the relationship between the UK and Bahrain would be impaired by the disclosure he was seeking. The strength of the relationship allowed for “frank discussions” as evidenced by Britain’s willingness to criticise the Bahraini authorities on certain issues. In 2012 Alistair Burt had criticised the harsh sentences imposed on Bahraini activists and William Hague, as Foreign Secretary, had expressed similar concerns in 2011. 32. Given the extent of British influence in Bahraini politics in the 1970s, understanding the security situation would enlighten the public about the UK government’s knowledge and role in matters. Because the withheld information referred to the security apparatus – or indeed the security situation – it was clearly within the British remit with regards to its historical and contemporary role. While there might be a significant public interest in maintaining strong relations between the UK and Bahrain, the withheld information was necessary to give the public the information needed to promote good decision-making by public bodies including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Closed Material 33. The Tribunal was provided in advance of the hearing with an agreed bundle of material which included an unredacted version of the information in question and an unredacted version of the written witness statement of Mr Oakden. 34. The Tribunal reminded itself of the guidance for the approach to be taken by courts and tribunals in respect of any closed material procedure. 35. In Bank Mellat v HMT (no.1) [2013] UKSC 38, which was not a case about FOIA, Lord Neuberger said at paragraphs 68-74 that: i) If closed material is necessary, the parties should try to minimise the extent of any closed hearing. - 12 -ii) If there is a closed hearing, the lawyers representing the party relying on the closed material should give the excluded party as much information as possible about the closed documents relied on. iii) Where open and closed judgments are given, it is highly desirable that in the open judgment the judge/Tribunal (i) identifies every conclusion in the open judgment reached in whole or in part in the light of points made or evidence referred to in the closed judgment and (ii) says that this is what they have done. iv) A judge/Tribunal who has relied on closed material in a closed judgment should say in the open judgment as much as can properly be said about the closed material relied on. Any party excluded from the closed hearing should know as much as possible about the court’s reasoning, and the evidence and the arguments it has received. 36. In Browning v Information Commissioner and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [2013] UKUT 0236 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal issued similar guidance about the use of closed material and hearings in FOIA cases, noting that such practices are likely to be unavoidable in resolving disputes in this context: i) FOIA appeals are unlike criminal or other civil proceedings. The Tribunal’s function is investigative, i.e. it is not concerned with the resolution of an adversarial civil case based on competing interests. ii) Closed procedures may therefore be necessary, for consideration not only of the disputed material itself, but also of supporting evidence which itself attracts similar sensitivities. iii) Parliament did not intend disproportionate satellite litigation to arise from the use of closed procedures in FOIA cases. iv) Tribunals should take into account the Practice Note on Closed Material in Information Rights Cases (issued in May 2012). They should follow it or explain why they have decided not to do so. v) Throughout the proceedings, the Tribunal must keep under review whether information about closed material should be provided to an excluded party. 37. It was necessary for the Tribunal to see and consider the disputed information in order to reach its decision. 38. The Tribunal has considered carefully and rigorously the Appellant’s and the FCO’s points and concerns already expressed in the notice of appeal and in other representations and submissions. - 13 -39. For reasons given in a separate, confidential Annex A, the Tribunal has concluded that some additional material can be released from that which was redacted in the 1977 Memorandum and from Mr Oakden’s written witness statement. Conclusion and remedy 40. The Tribunal accepts at the outset that it has had the advantage not granted to the Appellant of seeing all the information that has been withheld in the context of this appeal. 41. It can understand why he, and anyone reading this decision, should question why information recorded from a meeting with the British head of the Bahrain Special Branch – Brigadier Ian Henderson – and a senior British FCO official as long ago as 1 December 1977 should remain sufficiently sensitive in terms of this country’s international relations with Bahrain as to continue to be undisclosable because the public interest requires this. 42. Nearly 40 years have elapsed, there is some information publicly available about the human rights issues and history involved and the question must inevitably be asked “what is so special or potent about what remains redacted that it cannot be disclosed?” The short answer is that what remains redacted is fairly and squarely information which attracts the operation and engagement of section 27 FOIA because it could damage the United Kingdom’s relations with Bahrain and, if revealed, would or would be likely to prejudice international relations. 43. The Tribunal’s case law in relation to the meaning of “prejudice” – and the likelihood of that arising – was comprehensively set out in the two paragraphs quoted immediately below from the decision in Campaign Against the Arms Trade v IC and MoD (EA/2007/0040). [80] As a matter of approach the test of what would or would be likely to prejudice relations or interests would require consideration of what is probable as opposed to possible or speculative. Prejudice is not defined, but we accept that it imports something of detriment in the sense of impairing relations or interests or their promotion or protection - 14 -and further we accept that the prejudice must be “real, actual or of substance….”. [81] However, we would make it clear that in our judgement prejudice can be real and of substance if it makes relations more difficult or calls for particular diplomatic response to contain or limit damage which would not otherwise have been necessary. We do not consider that prejudice necessarily requires demonstration of actual harm to the relevant interests in terms of quantifiable loss or damage. For example, in our view there would or could be prejudice to the interests of the UK abroad or the promotion of those interests if the consequence of disclosure was to expose those interests to the risk of an adverse reaction from [X] or to make them vulnerable to such a reaction notwithstanding that the precise reaction of [X] would not be predictable either as a matter of probability or certainty. The prejudice would lie in the exposure and vulnerability to that risk. 44. Also, in terms of the appropriate weight to be attached to the views of officials with expertise in international diplomacy – in this case Mr Oakden who is the FCO’s Director of the Middle East and who among other things had been British Ambassador to the UAE from 2006 – 2010 – the Upper Tribunal decision in All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition v IC and FCO [2011] UKUT 153 (AAC) known more commonly as APPGER is instructive. This decision makes it clear that there are two issues: whether the disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice international relations and, if so, whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing it. At Paragraph 56 is the observation: Both are matters for the Tribunal to determine for itself in the light of the evidence. Appropriate weight needs to be attached to evidence from the executive branch of government about the prejudice likely to be caused to particular relations by disclosure of particular information. 45. While Mr Oakden’s written and oral evidence to the Tribunal was of considerable assistance in dispelling any final doubts that the Tribunal might have held, even without his evidence the Tribunal would have had little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it has in this appeal. 46. The Tribunal believes that some limited and additional evidence that is currently redacted can be made public but, apart from that, the information that is then withheld is properly withheld under the provisions of section 27 - 15 -FOIA on the basis that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing it. 47. There is a strong public interest in maintaining the U.K.’s relations with the Kingdom of Bahrain and with the other States within the Gulf region to which the Kingdom of Bahrain has close ties. There is a strong public interest in ensuring stability in the Gulf region, the kingdom of Bahrain is host to the UK’s Royal Navy and RAF and an adverse impact on the UK’s relationship with Bahrain could impact on the UK’s defence interests and the UK relies on and benefits from the assistance of Bahrain in other areas such as immigration and consular services. 48. The Tribunal finds that the remainder of the disputed information would – as opposed to would be likely to – have an adverse effect on relations between the UK and Bahrain. 49. Our decision is unanimous. 50. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 11th May 2015 - 16 -"

Subject matter: Qualified exemptions - Law enforcement s.31 Absolute exemptions - Prohibitions on disclosure s.44IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0055 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed in part and the Decision Notice dated 11 March 2014 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: Competition & Markets Authority Complainant: David Simmons Decision: The original decision notice shall stand save that, for the reasons set out in the Reasons for Decision below and the Confidential Annex to that decision, the Public Authority should disclose to the Complainant, within 35 days of the date of the Reasons for Decision, the information identified in the Confidential Annex. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction and Summary of Conclusions 1. This appeal is against a Decision Notice of the Information Commissioner dated 11 March 2014 (“the Decision Notice”), in which the Information Commissioner decided that the Office of Fair Trading had been entitled to refuse a request for information submitted by the Appellant because the information was exempt information under sections 31 (prejudice to law enforcement) and 44 (statutory prohibition on disclosure) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). Since the Decision Notice was issued the relevant functions of the Office of Fair Trading have been assumed by the Competition and Markets Authority, the Second Respondent to the Appeal. For simplicity we will refer to both bodies as “the Public Authority”. 2. We have decided that, with the exception of information contained in a few documents held by the Public Authority, the Information Commissioner was right to conclude that it had been justified in refusing the information request. The documents to be disclosed are listed in a confidential annex to this decision together with our detailed reasons for ordering disclosure. However we give a general indication of those reasons in paragraphs 41- 43 below. Background facts3. The Public Authority has powers under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA 1974”) to monitor the operations of those holding a consumer credit licence. In particular it may impose “requirements” on licence holders where it is dissatisfied with their conduct and it may also, where appropriate, suspend or revoke an organisation’s licence. On 7 December 2010 it exercised those powers by issuing a notice addressed to Firstplus Financial Group PLC (“Firstplus”) requiring it to (a) follow its existing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and official guidance, and (b) not to change those policies and procedures for a period of three years without prior notification to the Public Authority. This notice of requirements was issued at the end of an investigation into the operation by Firstplus of an interest variation provision included in its standard contract for second charge loans. However, the notice did not contain any indication of the facts uncovered during the investigation or the reasons for deciding that a notice of requirements was justified and appropriate. 4. The Appellant had become concerned that the terms regarding interest in the Firstplus second charge loan documentation were unfair, in particular an interest rate variation provision. Since 2009 the Appellant and other members of a campaign group, of which he is a member, have corresponded with the Public Authority with a view to persuading it to take action against Firstplus. They were particularly concerned at what they thought was a lenient approach by the Public Authority in imposing an apparently mild sanction on Firstplus and declining to provide detailed findings arising from its investigation or reasoned arguments for adopting the approach that it did. The request for information and the scope of enquiry arising under it 5. The Decision Notice proceeded on the basis that the request for information which led ultimately to this Appeal was contained in an email dated 26 June 2013 and covered, (to quote from paragraph 2 of the Decision Notice), “any information concerning adverse behaviour” by Firstplus. We became concerned, during the hearing of the Appeal, that the information request, when read in context, might have a broader meaning and asked the parties to provide us with the complete sequence of correspondence that preceded the email of 26 June 2013. 6. The material provided by the parties at that stage, read alongside other material in the bundle of documents prepared for the Appeal, demonstrated the following history: a. The Appellant entered into correspondence with the Public Authority about what he regarded as its inadequate response to the perceived unfairness of the operation by Firstplus of its interest provision. This had led to interest charges increasing (to 13.9% in some cases) during a period of time when interestrates, generally, were reducing. The Appellant’s evident purpose was to both complain about how the Public Authority had dealt with the matter in the past and to seek its assistance for the future. In that context he made it clear that he was contemplating legal proceedings against Firstplus and wished to know what Firstplus had been found guilty of by the Public Authority to justify the imposition of formal requirements. b. On 13 May 2013 the Public Authority, in the form of its Head of the Enquiries and Reporting Centre, wrote to the Appellant in an apparent attempt to pull together the various points he had raised. Having first defended the speed and adequacy of the Public Authority’s responses, the letter went on to identify a possible request for the disclosure of information under either the FOIA or the Enterprise Act 2002 (“EA 2002“). (In certain circumstances the Public Authority has a discretion under EA 2002 to disclose information it has acquired in confidence if the information is required for the purpose of litigation – see paragraph 15 below.) Although the letter provided detailed reasons for refusing to disclose under EA 2002 it said nothing about FOIA. c. The Appellant sent a reply to the Public Authority on the same day in which he said: “…we consumers are not being treated fairly/reasonably nor do we have access to a free market for the purpose of access to competition hence exploitation. Humble consumers like myself have no choice but to rely on their regulators to look into these matters & find some common ground with a regard to fixing this situation, I find it very difficult to believe that this can be ignored/let to continue without some kind of investigation.” d. In an email of 3 June 2013 the Appellant tried to be more specific in stating that he would like “any information you may be able to provide…”. That prompted a response from the Public Authority which disclosed uncertainty as to whether the Appellant was in fact intending to make an information request under FOIA. It went on to say: “if you advise us that you are in fact making a request for information under the FOIA, before we are able to deal with it, you will need to clearly describe the information that you are seeking so that we can consider whether we hold the requested information and whether or not we are under a duty to disclose it to you taking into account the exemptions which may apply.”e. On 11 June 2013 the Appellant emailed in reply, explaining some of the legal and administrative steps being taken by him and others in respect of Firstplus and seeming to suggest that he would like any information which the Public Authority held which might assist those processes. The Public Authority’s response to that communication, in a letter dated 21 June 2013, was to reiterate that it did not intend to treat any of the previous communications as a request for information under FOIA and that, if that was the Appellant’s intention, “you would need to describe the information sought to enable the OFT to consider (1) whether we hold the information requested and (2) whether or not the OFT was under any duty to disclose it.” f. On 21 June 2013 the Appellant sent the Public Authority an email in which he confirmed that he did wish to pursue the FOIA route to obtain information. His explanation of exactly what he sought is a little difficult to follow but we believe a fair reading of the document is that the information sought was any relating to the interest variation provisions relied on by Firstplus that had led the Public Authority to conclude that its requirements letter was appropriate. The Public Authority, however, stated, in a letter dated 26 June 2013 that it was still not clear to it what information was being sought and sought clarification of “what specifically you are requesting under FOIA”. g. The Appellant provided his answer to the question in an email sent on the same date, which clarified that his underlying complaint was about the operation by Firstplus of interest rates and “associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends & fair/unfair terms.” The email continued: “I would be grateful if it would be considered that any information held on related subject matter which could bring about a more informed conclusion on these matters specifically from the [Financial Ombudsman Service] initially & possibly in a legal capacity should matters have to go that far. … “If information is being held concerning adverse behaviour by [Firstplus] in relation to any of this in total or specific then I must request that consideration is given to release that information.” h. The Public Authority treated that email as a request for information under FOIA concerning adverse behaviour by Firstplus in relation to “interest rates and associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends and fair/unfair terms” Our view as to the scope of the request for information.7. We interpret the request, in the context summarised above, as being for information relied on by the Public Authority in reaching the decision to impose requirements on Firstplus and/or disclosing the approach adopted by the Public Authority to its investigation, including the record of its conclusions and the public availability of that record. We do not think that the Appellant was asking for information about any allegations that others may have made from time to time, nor of facts or evidence that those other complainants may have presented to the OFT. He was looking for the Public Authority’s findings, in a form which he could utilise in order to support his campaign, including the pursuit of the civil claim he evidently had in mind. 8. It is evident that the Public Authority interpreted the information request more broadly in some respects (such as complaints and information requests received from third parties), and more narrowly in others (so as to exclude its detailed conclusions and its decision not to include them in the requirements notice). The Public Authority’s response to the information request 9. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 10. The Public Authority refused the Appellant’s request for information in a letter to him dated 3 July 2013. It stated that disclosure would prejudice the Public Authority’s ability to carry out effectively its investigatory functions and that the requested information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 31(1)(a) and (g). The relevant parts of that provision are as follows: “Information … is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice – (a) the prevention or detection of crime, … (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), …”“(2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are – (a) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, (b) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, (c)the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise, (d) the purpose of ascertaining a person’s fitness or competence in relation to the management of bodies corporate or in relation to any profession or other activity which he is, or seeks to become, authorised to carry on, …” 11. The basis of the Public Authority’s reliance on this exemption was expressed in these terms: “Persons conducting investigations need sufficient space to carry out their work, free of interference and any risk the investigation will be undermined by the disclosure of information about the way in which an investigation has been conducted, the internal processes that were followed, and the relevant information from other sources.” 12. The Public Authority acknowledged that the exemption was a qualified exemption, so that the information would still have to be disclosed unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. It informed the Appellant that it acknowledged that there was a strong public interest in transparency but considered that this was outweighed by the public interest in maintaining confidence in its system of regulatory enforcement. 13. The refusal was maintained following an internal review carried out at the Appellant’s request. At that stage the Public Authority indicated, in a letter to the Appellant dated 13 August 2013, that it proposed to rely on FOIA section 31(1)(g), rather than 31(1)(a). It also asserted that it was entitled to rely, in addition, on FOIA section 44(1)(a), read alongside EA 2002 section 237. 14. FOIA section 44 reads: “(1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it – (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment.” EA 2002 section 237 reads: “(1) This section applies to specified information which relates to-(a) … (b) any business of an undertaking. (2) Such information must not be disclosed – (a) … (b) while the undertaking continues in existence unless the disclosure is permitted under this Part.” EA 2002 section 238, as applied to the facts of this case, provides that “specified information” is information which “comes to” the Public Authority in connection with the exercise of certain functions, including the conduct of investigations under the CCA 1974. 15. There are certain circumstances where, notwithstanding the prohibition set out in section 237, the Public Authority may disclose relevant information. The use of the word “may” demonstrates that the Public Authority would have a discretion as to whether or not to disclose: it would not be obliged to do so. One of the circumstances in which the Public Authority would be able to exercise the discretion in favour of disclosure is where information is sought for the purpose of establishing or enforcing legal rights through a civil claim (EA 2002 section 241A(1)). 16. FOIA section 44 is an absolute exemption. If it is found to be engaged then disclosure need not be made: there is no requirement to consider the public interest balance under FOIA section 2. 17. The Public Authority also indicated at this stage that it wished to rely also upon FOIA section 40 (in order to protect the personal data of individuals who might be identified in documents covered by the information request), as well as section 42 (to protect material included in such documents which was covered by legal professional privilege). 18. The Appellant’s response to the outcome of the internal review was to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner about the way in which his information request had been handled. The Information Commissioner’s investigation and the Decision Notice 19. Early in the Information Commissioner’s investigation he indicated that he did not intend to focus his investigation on the section 40 and section 42 exemptions because the information they covered was included in the same documents for which the original two exemptions were asserted. At the same time the Information Commissioner asked the Public Authority for a copy of the withheld information but, in light of its statutory obligation to maintain confidence, the Public Authority declined to release it without a formal Information Notice first being issued. Once that had been issued the Public Authority provided the Information Commissioner with a quantity of material which it said fell within the wide scope of the information request. The material hadbeen marked up manually to indicate which exemption was relied on in respect of each item of withheld information. 20. On 11 March 2014 the Information Commissioner issued the Decision Notice. He concluded that FOIA section 44 applied to the information in respect of which it was relied on by the Public Authority. It was information which had come to the Public Authority in the course of its investigation of complaints made about Firstplus and clearly related to the business of that company or to individuals mentioned within the information. 21. Although the decision under FOIA section 44 covered most of the withheld information there was some which did not fall within it and the Information Commissioner accordingly considered it in the context of FOIA section 31. He was satisfied that the Public Authority did have law enforcement powers that brought its activities within section 31(2) and that disclosure of the relevant information would reveal how it went about its work under CCA 1974 and would make it harder to do future work of that nature. He also concluded that disclosure would lead to the discouragement of those who might otherwise cooperate with the Public Authority. The exemption was therefore engaged, in his view. As to the public interest test the Information Commissioner acknowledged that there was a public interest in disclosure, because this would promote greater transparency and accountability in the Public Authority’s actions. In that context he drew attention to a number of individuals, who were in a similar situation to that of the Appellant and who had expressed concern about the outcome of the Public Authority’s investigation of Firstplus. He set in the balance against those considerations the public interest in the effective operation of the Public Authority’s regulatory functions, which he thought would be undermined if its methods of investigation were to be disclosed. Those being investigated would not feel able to deal frankly with it when being investigated and communications within the investigating team might become more guarded. He saw strength in that argument even though the investigation of Firstplus had been completed by the time that the information request was submitted. He also took into account that the information which had been withheld under FOIA section 31(1)(g), and which was not otherwise exempt under section 44, was minimal and would add little to public understanding. 22. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Public Authority should be able to regulate the credit licence regime, for the benefit of consumers as a whole, and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption therefore outweighed the public interest in disclosure. The Appeal to this Tribunal 23. On 17 March 2014 the Appellant lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice with this Tribunal.24. Such Appeals are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 25. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal did not seek to join issue with the detailed arguments set out in the Decision Notice. The essence of his argument was that the injustices which he felt had been suffered by people like him, who were trapped into second charge agreements at high interest rates, should outweigh the advantage of confidentiality in the regulatory processes. On that basis he asked, in effect, for the withheld information to be reviewed to see what could be made available in order to provide the public with information about the Public Authority’s investigation and its decision to serve a notice of requirements on Firstplus which did not record, or was not accompanied by, its reasons for doing so. 26. In a written Response filed by the Information Commissioner on 11 April 2014 it was argued that the effect of the Grounds of Appeal was to challenge the application of the public interest balance arising under FOIA section 31 and that there was therefore no challenge to the conclusions in the Decision Notice to the effect that the exemption was engaged. Nor, it was said, was there a challenge to the conclusion that the section 44 exemption was engaged and, in that respect, there was no requirement to consider the public interest because the exemption was absolute. 27. The Appellant did seek to clarify his Grounds of Appeal, in response to an invitation to that effect from the Tribunal Registrar, by asserting that he did wish to challenge the engagement of the section 44 exemption. However, his supporting arguments reverted to a general concern that the FOIA should not be used to prevent him, and others in a similar position to him, from being given the information requested. 28. On 21 May 2014 a Direction Notice was issued by the Chamber President to the effect that the Public Authority should be made a party to the Appeal. On 19 June 2014 the Public Authority filed its own written Response to the Appeal. It largely supported the Information Commissioner but also drew attention to the potential danger of disclosing information which might be said to have not “come to” the Public Authority and therefore to be outside the scope of the statutory prohibition relied on. Such information would, it was said, be of limited practical value for the purposes of anyone seeking to use it to call into question the appropriateness of the decision to either take, or not take, particular regulatory or enforcement actions against a holder of a consumer credit licence. It added:“It would be difficult for any fair-minded person to form any view about the appropriateness or otherwise of the [Public Authority’s] actions, on the basis of internal communications or other documents from which all information that had “come to” the OFT had been excised.” 29. The Appellant chose to have his Appeal considered at a hearing, rather than on the papers. That was his right. However, neither the Information Commissioner nor the Public Authority attended the hearing, both preferring to have the case determined on the basis of their written submissions. 30. The Tribunal was provided with the withheld information, in the same format as submitted to the Information Commissioner during his investigation. It was substantial in bulk and provided in unpaginated files, in reverse date order with a degree of overlap between the contents of different sections and an inadequate index. The Public Authority sought to impose on the Tribunal strict terms as to how the materials should be handled in order to prevent it being seen by any third party, including the Appellant. This included a requirement that the Appellant should not even be allowed to see how much material was involved. It was therefore necessary for the material to be placed in a secure place, outside the hearing room, while the appeal proceeded. It also led to the panel gaining access to the material rather too close to the date of the hearing than was desirable. 31. At the hearing the Appellant accepted that, in light of the Public Authority’s Response, the terms of FOIA section 44 left very little scope for him to develop the argument foreshadowed in his Grounds of Appeal: if and to the extent that withheld information was covered by the statutory prohibition there could be no reason to order its disclosure. His argument did, however, have impact on both the extent to which withheld information fell within the statutory prohibition for the purposes of FOIA section 44 and the issue of whether FOIA section 31 was engaged (and, if it was, the operation of the public interest balance). 32. The Appellant reiterated during the hearing that his interest was, not in seeing every item of information assembled by the Public Authority during the investigation, or every issue taken into consideration by those conducting the investigation. He simply wanted to know what it was that satisfied the Public Authority that it should issue a notice of requirements in the form that it did. The Tribunal’s deliberations and conclusions 33. The Tribunal panel has carefully considered every document made available to it by the Public Authority. This was done in part on the day of the hearing but, due to the late availability of the closed material andthe way in which it had been assembled, it was necessary to reconvene at a subsequent meeting. 34. We found that some of the material did not require to be disclosed because it falls outside the scope of the information request. We found that the withheld information included material relating to complaints and criticisms of the Public Authority submitted by individuals, (other than the Appellant) or groups. It also included requests for information from those individuals or groups. In some cases the correspondence included specific allegations about Firstplus and the way that it conducted its business. We considered that, in light of the interpretation of the information request in context, as summarised at paragraphs 7 and 8 above, these materials fell outside the scope of the information request and they were accordingly discarded. 35. Our overall conclusion is that the great majority of the remaining documents contained information falling within the scope of the information request and was properly withheld. 36. A careful study of the material satisfied us that many of the documents included information gathered by the Public Authority during the course of its investigation. They clearly recorded information that had “come to” the Public Authority in the course of performing its duties and fell within the statutory prohibition under CCA 1974. The information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 44. The materials took the form of written evidence, submissions presented to the Public Authority and notes made at meetings. On the whole we accepted that this exemption had only been relied upon in respect of documents that were clearly covered by it. 37. With respect to FOIA section 31, we accept the arguments put to us by the Information Commissioner and the Public Authority that those carrying out an investigation should be granted a considerable degree of confidentiality so that their working methods, and the thinking processes involved in assessing evidence and working towards conclusions, should not be available to the public, including those who might have an unworthy motive for obtaining such information. We are satisfied, therefore, that the Public Authority’s investigatory activities would be prejudiced if this category of information were to be disclosed. We are also satisfied that, with a few exceptions, the documents marked by the Public Authority as ones to which, he argued, this exemption applied were properly categorised as such. 38. Some of the material for which this exemption was claimed was anodyne in content. For example, it simply recorded arrangements for a meeting. In those circumstances the case for claiming that the section 31 exemption was engaged is less strong. However, as the information contained in such a document would not provide the Appellant with any of the sort of information he seeks, it would, in any event, fall outside the scope of the information request.39. The public interest in maintaining the section 31 exemption would have been stronger had the notice of requirement included, or been accompanied by, an explanation of what it was that had convinced the Public Authority that the service of such a notice was appropriate. However, we are satisfied that preserving privacy in respect of the investigation is sufficiently important that it outweighs the public interest in the disclosure of much of the material covered by this exemption. 40. In the course of our review of the materials we identified a small number of documents which are not exempt and should be disclosed. We have set out in a confidential annex to this decision our reasons for concluding that they fell within the scope of the information request and should be disclosed. 41. We are able to say, in this open part of our decision that in some cases the documents did not contain any information falling within the scope of the prohibition in EA section 237. In others the information that would bring the document within the scope of that provision can be redacted without the document as a whole losing its meaning. We have indicated in the confidential annex the redactions which should be made. 42. In some cases we have concluded that the exemption provided under FOIA section 31 does not apply because the document was created after the investigation had been completed and a decision made. We have also concluded, in those cases, that even if the exemption had applied the public interest in disclosure is at least equal to the public interest in continued secrecy so that the exemption may not be maintained under FOIA section 2(2)(b). 43. In every case where we have concluded that neither section 31 nor section 44 of the FOIA prevent disclosure we have considered, also, whether the exemptions provided in either section 40 (third party personal data) or section 42 (legal professional privilege) might apply. We are satisfied that, for the most part, the seniority of those identified justifies disclosure (because it would not constitute a breach of the data protection principles), but the names of less senior individuals have been redacted. We have made an appropriate redaction to one of the documents in order to protect legal professional privilege. We accordingly direct that the Public Authority disclose the documents identified in the annex, and redacted in accordance with guidance we have provided there, within 35 days of the date of this decision. 44. The confidential annex should itself remain confidential until the time for appealing this decision has expired and, in the event that an appeal has been filed by then, that appeal has either been withdrawn or disposed of. 45. Our decision is unanimous.Chris Ryan Judge 21st January 2015"

The Respondent did not attend and was not represented Subject matter: Cost of compliance and appropriate limit s.12Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0153 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed and the Decision Notice dated 22 May 2014 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: NHS ENGLAND Complainant: Cllr. J Illingworth Decision: For the reasons set out in the Reasons for Decision below the Public Authority may not rely on section 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 as a ground for refusing the Complainant’s information request and should, within 35 days, either disclose the requested information or identify the exemption or exemptions on which it relies as justifying a refusal to disclose. REASONS FOR DECISION The Request for Information and the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice in respect of it. 1. The Appellant has, for some little time, pursued an interest in the enforced closure in March 2013 of the Paediatric Cardiac Unit at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (“LTHT”) and its subsequent re-instatement a few days later. He has submitted a number of requests for information to NHS England. Each request fell to be considered under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). That section imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. 2. On 8 June 2013 the Appellant submitted the following request to NHS England (“the June Request”): “Please can I have copies of all the email messages and reports sent or received by Sir Bruce Keogh in connection with the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust from 1 March 2013 to the present day? 2Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 Sir Bruce Keogh was the National Medical Director for NHS England at the time. 3. There was some delay in processing the request and on 16 August 2013 the Appellant submitted a further request to NHS England (“the August Request”) in the following terms: “...In view of the passage of time, please could I submit an additional FoI request for copies of all the email message and reports sent or received by Sir Bruce Keogh in connection with the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust from 8 June 2013 to the present day.” 4. Subsequently a large number of emails were disclosed to the Appellant in response to the June Request, although there is an ongoing dispute about the extent to which individuals’ names had been redacted. However, in the case of the August Request NHS England refused to disclose anything. It said that it would rely on FOI Section 12, the relevant part of which reads: “(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit” Under the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 the “appropriate limit”, in the case of a public authority such as NHS England, is £450, calculated on the basis that a flat rate of £25 per hour should be allocated to any staff member contributing to the task. The effect is to set the maximum time that may be spent before the cost limit is exceeded at 18 hours. Regulation 4(3) of the same regulations provides: “...In a case in which this regulation has effect, a public authority may, for the purpose of its estimate, take account only of the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in – (a) determining whether it holds the information, (b) locating the information, or a document which may contain the information, (c) retrieving the information, or a document which may contain the information, and (d) extracting the information from a document containing it...” 5. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner about the way in which the August Request had been handled. On 22 May 2014, at the end of an investigation, the Information Commissioner issued a decision notice setting out his conclusions (“the Decision Notice”). 3Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 6. The relevant part of the Decision Notice read as follows: “12. NHS England said that to understand and estimate the time it would take to comply with this request, the office of Sir Bruce Keogh reviewed the email and filing accounts. It explained that Sir Bruce Keogh’s NHS England email account contains email correspondence from around February 2013 to the present day. It said that on average, based over 7 days, Sir Bruce Keogh receives 40 emails daily. Within Sir Bruce Keogh’s email account, and in the absence of a corporate electronic records management/filing system for NHS England, many emails received in the inbox are filed into a large series of sub-folders according to their subject matter. It explained that currently there are an inbox, sent folder and 36 sub-folders on different subject matters in Sir Bruce’s email account. “13 NHS England acknowledged that it does hold information falling within the scope of the request. However, to ensure any emails in relation to Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT), regarding any subject matter are captured, it said it is necessary to review all emails within the specified time frame, as the scope of the request does not allow sufficient narrowing down to focus on specific subject matter folders, as emails in relation to LTHT, regarding any subject matter could be located in any of the 36 sub-folders, inbox or sent folder. “14 Whilst NHS England accepts the initial location as being Sir Bruce Keogh’s email account this is not sufficient in locating specific pieces of information which fall in scope of the request itself. NHS England said that to locate the information would involve a review of Sir Bruce Keogh’s entire email account for the time frame specified. It said that within the 36 sub-folders the number of emails in each one ranges from a small number in single figures to some having around 1,000+ in them. “15 It said that it has reviewed the requested time period of 8 June to 16 August 2013. It confirmed that there are roughly 966 emails within this time period that would need to be reviewed. This is without understanding scope or relevancy of the request submitted. Using an approximate and average guide of it taking two minutes to review each email in the inbox over the specified period of time, it estimates that it would take: (2 minutes) x (966 emails) = 1.938 minutes: 32 hours, 18 minutes. 4Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 “16 It said that this is before any sub-folders or the sent folder has been searched/reviewed for emails over the specified time period. “17 Finally NHS England explained that a search function can be used to assist with narrowing the numbers of emails down, but this would not be a complete solution. It said that simply using a search function on ‘LTHT’, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust”, or simply ‘Leeds’ is insufficient as some emails may not actually refer to these, neither in the email heading nor content of the email. For example, they may only refer to a named individual at the Trust, and therefore some relevant emails may not be captured.” 7. The Information Commissioner went on in the Decision Notice to accept the calculations underlying the NHS England’s costs estimate, as summarised above, and to conclude that the cost limit would have been exceeded. The Appeal to this Tribunal 8. The Appellant challenged the correctness of the Decision Notice in his Grounds of Appeal, which accompanied a Notice of Appeal filed with this Tribunal on 18 June 2014. In a Response document filed by the Information Commissioner on 17 July 2014 he reiterated the evidence and arguments which had convinced him to find in favour of NHS England in the Decision Notice. He also provided the following additional information, which he had obtained from NHS England after the Appeal process had commenced: a. The figure of 966 emails in Sir Bruce Keogh’s inbox had not been arrived at by counting those transmitted within the two month period covered by the August Request but had been calculated by dividing the total number received in the inbox over a 15 month period (7,250) by the number of months, to provide a monthly average, and then doubling that figure. b. Using the same calculation method it was estimated that: i. the sent folder would have contained 188 emails created during the period covered by the August Request; and ii. the 36 sub folders would have contained 750 such emails. 9. The Appellant opted to have the Appeal determined at a hearing, which took place in Leeds on 6 October 2014. The Appellant appeared in person but the Information Commissioner opted to rely on his written submissions and not to be represented. 5Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 10. The basis of the Appellant’s case was that the estimate made by NHS England had exaggerated the difficulty of identifying relevant emails and the time that this would take. He presented a detailed written submission (which was sent to the Information Commissioner after the hearing) on various searching and filtering facilities available in the Microsoft Outlook emailing system which demonstrated, he said, that a response could have been made to the August Request using far less time than NHS England had estimated. Our Conclusions 11. We cannot be certain that NHS England uses the same email system as that used by the Appellant to demonstrate the speed at which keyword searches could identify relevant documentation. The Appellant believes that it does and presented evidence to that effect. NHS England has not disclosed which system it uses. Nor has it provided any information about the speed and sophistication of any search function incorporated in it. It clearly had such facilities available, however, as it previously informed the Information Commissioner during his investigation that a search function could have been used to assist in narrowing down the number of emails that were relevant to an information request. Its case to the Information Commissioner, however, was, not that the cost limit would still have been exceeded, but that some relevant emails might not be captured by this means. The Information Commissioner reiterated the argument in his Response document in this appeal, explaining that he was persuaded that not all emails would be caught by a simple search using obvious search terms. Consequently, he said, “NHS England would be required to retrieve all emails within the relevant time period to review the same to ascertain whether such emails fell within the scope of the request”. 12. We are conscious that a section 12 refusal is required to be based on an estimate and that it would be inappropriate for the Information Commissioner or this Tribunal to subject such estimates to an over- detailed analysis. However, in this case we consider that both NHS England and the Information Commissioner set too rigorous a test for the process of searching for information falling within the scope of the August Request. This Tribunal has made it clear in a number of cases that, provided a public authority can demonstrate that it has formulated an appropriate method for seeking out information, and has then followed that method with reasonable rigour, it will be likely to have satisfied its obligation to identify requested information. The established test on whether or not relevant information is deemed to have been held by a public authority at the relevant time is based, not on absolute certainty, but 6Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 on the balance of probabilities. It was therefore open to NHS England to formulate one or more search terms, to be applied across all folders in Sir Bruce Keogh’s email files, and to use that as the basis of its disclosure. Doubtless it would still have been necessary for a member of the NHS England staff to review the search results in order to ensure that irrelevant items had not been included, but this would have taken very much less time than the two minutes per email estimated for the purpose of the manual search system on which NHS England based its estimate. 13. We would regard it as a very unsatisfactory outcome if a public authority could avoid giving any disclosure, simply because there was a possibility that some items of information would not be brought to light by a search. 14. The Appellant argued, in addition, that the method of assessing the number of potentially relevant emails by averaging over a 15 month period was misguided because it took no account of the variation in quantity between the period covered by the August Request and the number which (he could see from the outcome of previous information requests), had been sent and received when concern about LTHT had been at its highest. We think the criticism is justified although we are not able to say how great the reduction in email traffic was. 15. In summary, therefore, we are not satisfied that NHS England made out its case to the Information Commissioner that the cost of complying with the August Request would have exceeded the statutory maximum. We direct that NHS England, within 35 days of this decision, either disclose the requested information to the Appellant or identify any exemption it intends to rely on in order to resist disclosure of some or all of it. Postscript 16. The Decision Notice included a criticism of NHS England for its failure to provide the Appellant with advice and assistance, pursuant to its obligations under FOIA section 16. It was said that this might have enabled the scope of the request to have been limited in order to avoid the section 12 cost limit being exceeded. The Information Commissioner focussed his criticism on a perceived failure by NHS England to draw the Appellant’s attention to the title of a sub-folder in Sir Bruce Keogh’s email system which suggested that it might contain emails that were relevant to the information request. Neither party appealed that aspect of the Decision Notice and it does not form part of this appeal. We comment, however, that the advice and assistance provided by a public authority in 7Appeal No. EA/2014/0153 this type of case may equally well extend to the formulation of one or more search terms which (particularly if agreed between the parties) might lead to the identification of a body of material satisfying the test for the scope of information held for the purposes of FOIA section 1.

SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust Complainant: Liam O’Hanlon The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant’s request for information made on 31 October 2013 was not dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part I of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in that (a) in breach of section 1(1), the Public Authority failed to supply all the information requested and (b) in so far as it did supply him with requested information, it did not do so promptly or within 20 working days, in breach of section 10(1). Action required In the interests of complete clarity, the Public Authority must by 16.00 on 31 October 2014 supply to the Complainant a full and complete print-out of the DATIX Admin Incident Review Form relating to the incident of 25 May 2013 which must include all entries made under any field save for any personal data which is exempt by virtue of section 40 of the Act, which must be redacted. HH Judge Shanks 24 October 2014 3Appeal No: EA/2014/0106 REASONS FOR DECISION Factual background 1. On 25 May 2013 the Appellant, Mr O’Hanlon, and another man visited a patient in a hospital run by the Second Respondent NHS Trust. There was an incident involving the two men and nursing staff on the ward about which it is unnecessary to say any more. 2. Following the incident Mr O’Hanlon made a formal complaint to the Trust. The Trust’s Chief Executive responded in a long letter dated 27 June 2013 rejecting his complaint. In the course of her letter the Chief Executive stated: … A DATIX incident form was raised following this incident in line with Trust policy and escalated to the senior nurse. 3. On 31 October 2013 Mr O’Hanlon made a FOIA request for “ … a copy of the … DATIX incident form” referred to in the Chief Executive’s letter. 4. On 21 December 2013 Mr O’Hanlon raised a formal complaint with the Information Commissioner that the Trust had not responded to his request. 5. On 16 January 2014 the Trust provided him with a print-out dated 14/01/14 of the relevant DATIX “Admin Incident Review Form.” The accompanying email stated that it was “… a copy of the Datix form … requested under [FOIA]” with all “patient identifiable information removed”. The print-out showed the “Opened Date” for the form as 28/05/13 and the “Closed Date” as 16/07/2013. On the same day Mr O’Hanlon responded by email complaining about the Trust’s delay in responding to his request, asking for further information and stating that his request had not been complied with properly, because, he said, his request had been for “… an existing document referred to in the … letter of 27 June 2013” and the document sent to him contained reference to a later date (16/07/2013), meaning that it could not be the document referred to in the letter. 4Appeal No: EA/2014/0106 6. On 20 January 2014 Mr O’Hanlon wrote to the Information Commissioner referring to his email to the Trust of 16 January 2014 which, he said, accused the Trust of sending him an “incorrect version of the document … requested by me.” The Commissioner in effect treated this as a new complaint under section 50 of FOIA and in due course he issued a decision notice dated 2 April 2014. His decision was that no further relevant information was held by the Trust beyond the print-out dated 14/01/14 but that the Trust had breached the requirement of section 10(1) of FOIA because it had not complied with section 1(1) within 20 working days. The appeal 7. On 26 April 2014 Mr O’Hanlon appealed against the Commissioner’s decision notice. His notice of appeal runs to 18 pages (with a large number of supporting documents) but his essential complaints, as we understand them, were (a) that the Commissioner had failed to grasp his point (referred to in para 5 above) that the document supplied on 16 January 2014 could not be the document he had requested (b) that the Trust had not explained the delay until 16 January 2014 or why they had not then supplied the correct document and (c) that the Commissioner had failed to investigate those matters properly. 8. In the course of the appeal the Trust has disclosed a further print-out of the DATIX Admin Incident Review Form dated 30/06/2014. This contains data which was not in the print-out dated 14/01/2014, in particular under the field headed “Investigation” (which was blank in the 14/01/2014 print-out). The Trust’s proferred explanation for this apparent omission (which was set out in their solicitors’ letter of 6 June 2014) is that “minimising” the “Investigation” and the “Contact” sections of the form was standard practice because they would often “ … contain personal data of either Trust staff or patients.” The solicitors went on to say that the Trust’s view was now that the “Investigation” section should be disclosed and the 30/06/2014 print-out has accordingly been provided to Mr O’Hanlon and included in the open bundle. 9. In the light of this development the Trust and the Commissioner have conceded that the appeal should be allowed because it is accepted that the full DATIX form was not supplied to Mr O’Hanlon on 16 January 2014. Before considering the consequences of that concession, we turn to consider the relief sought by Mr O’Hanlon in his notice 5Appeal No: EA/2014/0106 of appeal as expanded on in the various other substantial documents which he has lodged in the course of the appeal. Relief sought by Mr O’Hanlon 10. It is not entirely clear whether Mr O’Hanlon is still maintaining that he should have been supplied with a copy of a “document” which was in existence at the time of the Trust’s letter of 27 June 2013. In any event we are of the view that this point is misconceived. We are quite satisfied that there was never any such “document” and that the letter of 27 June 2013 was referring to a computer “form” which by its nature is filled in and updated electronically over time. In our view, in order to comply with Mr O’Hanlon’s request, the Trust was obliged to disclose the contents of the “form” as they were when he made his request, and not some earlier date. On the assumption that the “form” was indeed “closed” on 16 July 2013 (an assumption we have no reason to doubt), what should have been disclosed to Mr O’Hanlon were therefore the contents of the “form” as it was on that date. 11. In para 1 on (our) page 21 of his notice of appeal Mr O’Hanlon seeks a declaration that his complaint made on 21 December 2013 (to the effect that the Trust did not respond to his request) has been upheld. As the history indicates, that complaint was overtaken by events; the position is, as we will record, that the Trust responded to his request on 16 January 2014 but was late in doing so and only supplied some of the information he was entitled to. In para 2 he seeks a declaration that “… the document provided … on 16 January 2014 was not the document requested but a later, changed version of it.” As we have already indicated in our view Mr O’Hanlon was never entitled to a “document” as such but the terms of this declaration are accurate to the extent that the print-out supplied did not contain all the information in the “form” which it should have contained. 12. At paras 3, 4 and 5 on page 21 of his notice of appeal Mr O’Hanlon seeks a number of declarations about failures he ascribes to the Trust. Also, following on from the late disclosure of the Investigation section in the DATIX form, he is (perhaps understandably) suspicious and he seeks a direction that the Trust now co-operate with a proper investigation as to why they did not immediately disclose that section of the form in particular. Although we can understand why he may feel entitled to seek 6Appeal No: EA/2014/0106 such relief from the Tribunal, we are afraid that these are not matters within our purview. A complaint under section 50 (which is the basis, and the only basis, of both the Commissioner’s and the Tribunal’s jurisdiction) can only relate to an alleged breach of Part I of FOIA (see section 50(1)), typically, as here, a breach of section 1(1) (a failure to communicate information properly requested) or section 10(1) (a failure to do so promptly or in any event within 20 working days). The Tribunal has no free-standing jurisdiction to investigate or rule on the reasons for any such failure or delay or to grant the kind of declaratory relief Mr O’Hanlon seeks. 13. At paras 6-9 on page 21 of his notice of appeal Mr O’Hanlon seeks from the Tribunal various directions to be addressed to the Commissioner requiring him to investigate and decide upon aspects of the Trust’s behaviour in connection with his request. For the reasons set out in para 12 above, these are not matters within the purview of the Commissioner any more than they are matters within the purview of the Tribunal. But even if they had come within the Commissioner’s original jurisdiction on a complaint under section 50, it is clear that the Commissioner’s role as an investigator and adjudicator is finished once he has issued a decision notice: from that stage, the complainant’s route is to appeal to the Tribunal, the Commissioner becomes a party to the appeal and the Tribunal is the body which makes any necessary finding of fact (see section 58(2)). Disposal 14. As we have said, it is now conceded that the full DATIX form was not disclosed to Mr O’Hanlon and that (subject to redaction of personal data, to which Mr O’Hanlon expressly does not object) it should have been. There is no doubt that what was supplied was supplied late. We therefore allow the appeal and issue the substituted decision set out above. 15. At para 10 of its Skeleton Argument the Trust states emphatically that it does not hold any information coming within Mr O’Hanlon’s request which is beyond that contained in the print-outs of 14/01/2014 and 30/6/2014 and a further print-out which has been disclosed to us in a closed bundle. We are slightly concerned to note that the print-out in the closed bundle contains some details under the field “Additional Information” which are not in either of the other two. In the light of this and the 7Appeal No: EA/2014/0106 unfortunate background we will therefore require the Trust to consider the whole form carefully once more and to supply a final definitive print-out in accordance with the “Action Required” set out above within a week. 16. This decision is unanimous. HH Judge Shanks 24 October 2014 8"
"194","Substantive Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0023 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Appellant: Alan Clayton Respondent: Information Commissioner Second Respondent: Natural England Before: Melanie Carter (Judge) and Alison Lowton Melanie HowardAppeal No. EA/2014/0023 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal decided to uphold the appeal and ordered that the Decision Notice FER0499367 dated 6 January 2014 be replaced by the following: Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2014/0023 Dated 11th August 2014 Public authority: Natural England The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Decision Notice FER0499367 is substituted by the following: Regulations 12 and 13(2)(a)(i) of the Environmental Information Regulations do not apply to the disputed information in this appeal such that it is not exempt from disclosure. Thus, Natural England is to disclose this information within 28 days of this appeal decision. Dated this 11th day of August 2014 Signed Judge Carter 2Appeal No. EA/2014/0023 Reasons Background 1. On 15 November 2012, the Appellant submitted a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) to Natural England (“NE”) in relation to an area of land which forms part of the River Avon flood plains. He asked the following specific questions: (a) “I want to find out, what agreements have been reached with farmers and landowners in that locality?” (b) “Do we as taxpayers have the right to request the details of any of these agreements?” (c) “Where can find out my rights to access sites of special or scientific interest and information relating to why they have been declared SSS1s?” (d) “Where does Natural England get the funding from for any grants that are awarded?” 2. NE is an executive non-departmental public body which is responsible to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. NE responded to the above information request on 16 November 2012 and provided the Appellant with some relevant information. The Appellant replied on 11 January 2013 explaining that he wanted as much information as it was “reasonable for a tax payer to have” about a specific Environmental Stewardship Agreement. Under such agreements, European funds are granted to farmers and landowners. In the UK, Environmental Stewardship Agreements are administered, and the corresponding information held by, NE (which acts on the behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). 3. On 8 February 2013, NE provided the Appellant with a redacted version of the relevant agreement. NE relied on regulations 12(3) and 13 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIR”) to withhold some of the information contained within the agreement, including, in particular, the name of the beneficiary and the payment details of the grant. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who in turn upheld the decision of the NE in a Decision Notice dated 6 January 2014. This appeal considers whether the Decision Notice is in accordance with law. Analysis 4. Regulations 12(3) and 13(2)(a)(i) provide for an exception to the general duty of disclosure of environmental information where: (a) the information is the personal 3Appeal No. EA/2014/0023 data of a third party; and (b) the publication of that information would be in breach of any of the data protection principles. It is common ground between the parties that this appeal is indeed governed by the EIR and that the withheld information is personal data. Thus, the sole question before the Tribunal was whether disclosure of this information would be a breach of a data protection principle. The data protection principles are set out in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998 (""the DPA"") and include the first principle, which provides that: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully”. If the disclosure of the information would be unfair or otherwise contrary to the first data protection principle, NE is exempt from disclosure under regulation 12 EIR, read together with regulation 13 (2)(a)(i). 5. The Commissioner, in the Decision Notice, first of all considered what reasonable expectations the individual agreement holders would have in relation to the disclosure of their personal data. In its communications with the Commissioner, NE had explained that: (a) When it collected personal information from agreement holders it informed them via a privacy notice in its handbook that information about them, including of the nature withheld in this case (ie: name and amount of the grant), may be made public. Moreover, applicants for an Environmental Stewardship Agreement had to sign a declaration accepting the requirements as laid out in the handbook; (b) Prior to a ruling of the European Court of Justice in 2010, discussed below, it considered that the acceptance of the handbook's requirements constituted consent for the purposes of the DPA. Accordingly, until 2010 NE published agreement holders’ data as a matter of course in line with Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, which required the publication of data on beneficiaries of agricultural funds; (c) However, in 2010, NE argued that the European Court of Justice had ruled that such a requirement for publication was incompatible with an individual’s right for privacy where the agreement holder concerned was a private individual or sole trader, and therefore declared the relevant provisions of the EC Regulations to be void (cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 Volker und Markus Scheke GbR and Hartmut Eifert, “the ECJ Judgement”); (d) After the ECJ Judgement was issued, NE ceased the automatic publication of the personal data of agreement holders that are private individuals or sole traders. It also removed the information on natural persons from its websites and stopped other types of publication. It had not written to applicants to this effect (there being more than 40,000 grant recipients) (e) Even though consent for disclosure had been obtained from applicants for Environmental Stewardship Agreements through the acceptance of the 4Appeal No. EA/2014/0023 handbook's requirements, as described above, NE considered that the reasonable expectations of individuals in relation to the disclosure of their personal data of the type withheld in this case i.e. the agreement holder's name and the amount of grant they have received, changed in light of the ECJ Judgement. 6. NE informed the Appellant that it could not make disclosure on account of the ECJ Judgement. The letter of internal review of the refusal to disclose (28 May 2013) stated that: “This judgment says that certain information relating to ‘natural persons’ must be withheld and as such we have continued to do so”. In fact, NE’s own legal advice (as disclosed in the bundle) was not that it could not make the disclosure but rather the effect of the decision was to “partially invalidate[ ]” an EU Regulation which had created an obligation to publish the data. 7. From the Tribunal’s own reading of the ECJ decision, it disagreed with the way in which NE had described the effect of this decision to the Appellant. The ECJ had declared that the regulation was partially invalid but not ruled that the particular type of information could not in any circumstances be disclosed without breaching human rights or data protection law. It had found that the data controller in that case should have applied a set of criteria in balancing the interests for and against disclosure. 8. It appeared that NE, having stopped automatic publication of the personal data in relation to the Agreements at the suggestion of the European Commission, rather than carry out the balancing exercise required in relation to any request for information, had taken the position that it could not make the disclosure. 9. Applicants for grants including named person in the redacted information, had signed a form indicating consent to the terms included with the Handbook. The relevant version included the following: “To meet our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 we need to explain how we will handle the information you give us. Because Environmental Stewardship involves expenditure of public money, there is public interest in how the money is spent. Therefore Defra, may in certain circumstances, make information about your application and agreement publicly available for this purpose. We may also need to disclose details about your application and agreement to other organisations or individuals for administration, evaluation or monitoring purposes. Details disclosed may include your name, the name of your farm or business, grid references, the total area under agreement, the payment you receive, the location of fields and details of the environmental features and management options they contain. Such information may be released upon request under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 or the Freedom of Information Act 2000.” 5Appeal No. EA/2014/0023 10. NE had, at least prior to the ECJ Judgement, treated the applicants’ declaration that they would be bound by the Handbook’s terms as express consent to disclosure. The Tribunal was of the view, as did the Commissioner, that consent continued given the express terms set out above. 11. The Tribunal accepted however that given that post the ECJ Judgement, NE had changed its practice and stopped routinely disclosing on its website names of individual or sole trader applicants, this expectation might have changed. It was possible, although this was a matter of speculation given that there was no direct evidence on this point, that the applicant no longer expected the relevant personal data to be disclosed. 12. The Tribunal then asked itself whether, in terms of the first data protection principle, this was a reasonable expectation for the applicant to hold. When one combined the facts that an express consent had been given, that there had been no publicity by NE or mention on its website of the ECJ decision and finally, that the effect of that decision had not, in the event been to prohibit disclosure, it concluded that such an expectation would not be reasonable. On this critical point therefore the Tribunal disagreed with NE and the Commissioner in turn. 13. There was no evidence before the Tribunal as to the likelihood or otherwise of any prejudice or distress to the grant applicant were disclosure to be made. It was asserted by NE and accepted by the Commissioner that this was likely simply on account of the nature of the grant and its possible impact on the harmony between local residents. Without any evidence to support this however, the Tribunal was not satisfied that this would be the case. Moreover this submission seemed somewhat contradictory given the disclosure that had already been made. Further to the request for information, NE had already disclosed a map of the land in relation to which the grant had been given. Given the ease of public access to Land Registry information, it was reasonable to assume that the public could ascertain the owner of the land and therefore in all likelihood the recipient of the grant. NE itself had written during the course of a planning inquiry (albeit prior to the ECJ decision) naming the particular individual and stating that she was in receipt of the grant. 14. The lack of evidence of potential prejudice to the grant recipient was relevant also to the Tribunal’s view that paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the DPA would be satisfied were disclosure to be made. The Tribunal was of the view that there was a clear legitimate interest in these matters being made public (accountability in the spending of public monies) and disclosure was necessary to meet this legitimate interest (without a publicly disclosed sum, the Tribunal could not discern how the use of the funds could be rendered accountable). In this regard, the Tribunal did not accept NE's argument that the need for such transparency was largely served by the disclosure of the parts of the Environmental Stewardship Agreement which had already been made; the amount of the grant had not been disclosed and without this the accountability and transparency public interests were unlikely to be met. It further concluded that these 6Appeal No. EA/2014/0023 interests were not, for the reasons given above, outweighed by any prejudice to the data subject involved. 15. Given these findings, the Tribunal concluded that disclosure of the redacted information would not have been in breach of the first data protection principle. Conclusion 16. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that NE had been wrong in law in concluding that the personal data exception in regulation 13 of EIR applied and in turn the Decision Notice had not been in accordance with law. The Tribunal substituted the Decision Notice at the beginning of this decision and ordered that the redacted information be disclosed to the Appellant within 28 days of this Decision. 17. The Tribunal’s decision was unanimous. Signed Judge Carter Date: 11th August 2014 7"

Name of Complainant: Mr Narinder Singh Chadha The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Tribunal allows the appeal and substitutes the following decision notice in place of the decision notice dated 30 September 2014. Action Required The requested information should be supplied to the Appellant, subject to any relevant statutory exemptions, within 31 days of notice of this substituted Decision Notice. Fiona Henderson Tribunal Judge 2EA/2013/0260 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Mr Chadha’s wife has been a patient at Hillingdon Hospital and Mr Chadha has significant concerns relating to the care that she received there. As a result of this experience he told the Tribunal that he has become concerned about the level of care being given to all patients at the Hospital. He wrote to Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) on 18th October 2012 asking for information about complaints made to the Trust in relation to Emergency Care treatment and General medicine including the names, numbers and outcomes of any cases in the Courts, Tribunals, GMC or before the Health Ombudsman and for a comparison in relation to the national average reported by NHS from 2008 onwards. This was the 13th supplementary piece of correspondence from the Appellant to the Trust in a series dating back to an original information request dated 5th May 2012. The Trust categorised this as the 9th information request in 6 months. Additionally the Appellant had been in correspondence with the Complaints Manager, Claims and Litigation Manager and Assistant Director Corporate Governance in relation to his wife’s care. 2. On 29th October 2012, the Trust refused to comply with the request citing the exemption under s14 FOIA (vexatious request). Following the involvement of the ICO the Trust completed an internal review which upheld the original position. 1 3. Mr Chadha complained to the Commissioner. Following an investigation the Commissioner issued a decision notice dated 30th September 2013 which concluded that the Trust had applied s14(1) FOIA correctly. Mr Chadha appealed to the Tribunal on 27.11.13 setting out some background to his request and arguing that: a) his requests were not obsessive as of the previous communications only 2 of these were information requests, the rest were chasers, and that “vexation by drift” was not therefore made out. b) Any burden or disruption to the Trust was caused by the Trust’s failure to deal with the requests appropriately and that the Commissioner was not in a position to say whether compliance would cause a significant burden. c) There was a serious purpose behind the requests. 4. The Trust did not apply to join and the case was listed for an oral hearing to enable Mr Chadha to put forward his arguments in person, the Commissioner relied upon his decision notice and reply to the Grounds of Appeal and did not attend the oral hearing. The Tribunal had regard to an agreed open bundle of documents comprising some 99 pages. Mr Chadha also submitted some additional documentation at the hearing relating to his formal complaint with the Trust in relation to his wife’s care to refute the suggestion that he had refused to make a formal complaint. The Law 1 Dated 27th June 2013. 3EA/2013/0260 5. S14 –(1) provides that “Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious”. 6. The meaning of vexatious is not defined within the statute, however, it has recently been considered by the Upper Tribunal in Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC). In that case the Judge agreed that “vexatious” carries its “ordinary, natural meaning within the particular statutory context of FOIA.”2. He adopts a purposive approach and stated that: “...whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause” provides a useful starting point, so long as the emphasis is on the issue of justification (or not).“3 He recommends a holistic and broad approach to the determination of whether a request is vexatious or not, emphasising the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and especially where there is a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests. We adopt this approach. 7. In Dransfield the Judge identified four broad issues or themes 4 to assist in assessing whether a request was vexatious. These are not a checklist and are not applied as such by us but are used as a framework for weighing the evidence. The headings are: i) The burden (on the public authority and its staff). ii) Breadth. iii) The motive (of the requester). iv) The value or serious purpose (of the request). 8. When assessing these factors the Tribunal has kept in mind s12(1) of FOIA which provides: Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit. and s 16(1) of FOIA which provides: It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it. The Facts 9. The Tribunal agrees with the Commissioner that it is appropriate to consider previous dealings between Mr Chadha and the Trust and has had regard to the chain of correspondence between the Trust and Mr Chadha starting on 3.5.12 and concluding with the information request that is the subject of the appeal. From this we are satisfied that the Trust has not treated the request objectively and has made unjustified assumptions in its interpretation of the original information request. The initial request was: “ We want information relating to complaint5 against the Hillingdon Hospital from January 2008 to date in relation to A and E, the rest of the Hospital and all head injury complaints.” 2 Paragraph 24 the emphasis appears in the judgment. 3 Paragraph 26 4 paragraph 28 et seq 4EA/2013/0260 There was no definition of what he meant by the term “information” from Mr Chadha. This was interpreted by the hospital as meaning numbers, they did not seek clarification under s1(3) FOIA6 and Mr Chadha was supplied with the numbers of complaints from A and E and the rest of the hospital but was told “the system used to record complaints does not include a field for head injuries and therefore we are unable to extract this specific information”7. 10. This approach was also evident in other responses from the Trust (e.g. 20.7.12 and their letter of 14.8.12 where they reworded the request to include the assertion that he was asking “how many” complaints were logged when that was not an accurate representation of his request). We find that treating this request as a request for the number of complaints only was an assumption which unduly limited the response which, as became explicit in later correspondence (e.g letters 3 and 8), was a request for more detailed information. 11. Similarly the Trust has presumed that Mr Chadha is only interested in head injury or condition specific data when the terms of his correspondence are not so limited e.g. Mr Chadha in his 3rd letter asks: “Please let us know how we can access these8 complaints.” The Trust responded stating that under FOIA they are not expected to create information in response to requests and “complaints are not recorded by condition and therefore it is impossible to provide data on specific condition – related requests”. The Trust ought to have clarified which complaints Mr Chadha was asking to access. We infer from their response that the Trust have proceeded on the basis that Mr Chadha’s third letter is limited to asking about access to head injury complaints when as is apparent from the chain of correspondence and made explicit in his subsequent letter he was asking for access to all complaints that came under the heading Clinical Treatment. 12. We are satisfied that the Trust has not sought clarification under s1(3) FOIA or offered assistance in keeping with its duty under s16(1) FOIA when it would have been reasonable to do so. For example Mr Chadha’s second letter asked: “Please let us know how you classify these complaints.” We are satisfied that this is a request for guidance to assist in refining the original request and not a true request for information. To us it is clear that the headings of classification were not the information required of itself but an attempt by Mr Chadha to identify how to frame his information request to obtain the information that he required. The duty of a public authority to offer advice and assistance is crucial in a case such as this because they know what information they hold, how it is recorded and how it can be retrieved. In the absence of this information Mr Chadha is having to guess at the internal filing system of the public authority in the hopes of stumbling across the right form of words to unlock the information he seeks. 13. The Trust has provided limited and incomplete information in response to the requests. The Trust’s answer to this second letter stated that they classified complaints: “by subject, staff group, location and complexity. The Trust does not record specific conditions or injuries for instance, head injury would come under Clinical treatment”. 5 sic 6 Where a public authority reasonably requires further information to identify and locate the information requested. 7 Letter dated 30.5.12 8 Emphasis added 5EA/2013/0260 The Tribunal has had regard to the Trust’s response dated 9.8.12 to Mr Chadha’s 9th letter in which it is apparent that the Trust’s letter of 13.6.12 is incomplete as there are further classifications of: <U+F0B7> 5 staff groups <U+F0B7> 4 locations and <U+F0B7> 3 complexity indicators. Even this response (of 9.8.12) is inadequate as from their response to his 11th letter of 22.8.12 it becomes apparent that there are 4 further classifications in relation to one of the 4 Locations. 14. Mr Chadha’s 8th letter states that he wishes to view these complaints. We are satisfied that this is not a new element to the request but a restatement of the request of his first and third letters that was not fully answered by the Trust. The Trust’s response that this was not possible because of Data protection, does not give any advice and assistance under s16 FOIA on what could be provided within the terms of the Act, or indicate whether they have considered redaction. 15. Although Mr Chadha’s 10th and 11th letters (14.8.12 and 22.08.12) raise a fresh issue (asking for the name of the holders of various positions and their work addresses), the Tribunal considers this justified and to have arise out of the way that the Trust conducts itself. It is apparent from correspondence that the Trust has a policy of signing emails by title and not by name. It is not clear therefore who has written the letter and whether this is an individual that has already had some involvement or even whether it is the same correspondent. Mr Chadha told the Tribunal that he had letters returned as they had been sent to the wrong place and he was not sure who was responding to his letters. By way of example9 he stated that he could not tell from the internal review whether the person who completed it on behalf of the Trust really had had no prior involvement in his request because he did not know who the individual was. We consider this policy to lack transparency and to add an unnecessary layer of complexity to communications with the Trust. From the Trust’s letter of 14.8.12 it is apparent that the Trust’s assignment of responsibility is not easy for a lay person to follow e,.g. the data protection officer is the “Assistant Director corporate Governance” who is “the Trust lead for Corporate Governance which includes Data Protection”. Analysis The burden on the public authority and its staff. 16. The Trust argued before the Commissioner that 8 supplementary requests in 6 months related to the same subject was obsessive and argue that each response led to a further request in support of this. The Commissioner argued that the Trust has complied with all of the preceding requests up until the request of 18th October. This is material to the Tribunal’s consideration of to what extent (if any) these requests were a burden (on the public authority and its staff). From the Tribunal’s analysis of the correspondence as set out above the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Trust did answer the previous requests adequately and is satisfied that the Trust bears substantial responsibility for the level of correspondence. They did not provide advice and assistance under s16 when it would have been reasonable for them to have done so to enable Mr Chadha to formulate the request appropriately. They provided 9 Postdating the requests but illustrative of the problem and evident from the papers before us. 6EA/2013/0260 unhelpful and incomplete answers, made assumptions about the information being requested without reading the requests objectively or seeking clarification under s 1(3) FOIA. We are satisfied that this is the type of case envisaged in Dransfield “if the public authority in question has consistently failed to deal appropriately with earlier requests, that may well militate against such a finding that the new request is vexatious”. 17. The Commissioner argues that continuing to answer these requests would impose a significant burden on the public authority in terms of expense and distraction. The Trust have not quantified the work already done, the Tribunal has had regard to the amount and type of information supplied thus far and the internal review schedule of activity and does not accept that it is likely that the limited information provided thus far created a great deal of work being largely statistics and classifications and having come in the main from a single department. Although the Trust states that the information in the disputed request is not recorded centrally the Tribunal observes that some of the information would be expected to be reported back to the Trust from the complaints department or the legal department. The Trust have made this assertion as to the work required without being clear exactly what it is that the Appellant is seeking (p64 of the bundle). In our view it would be reasonable for the public authority to provide advice or guidance on how to narrow the request (s16(1) FOIA); failing which the costs limit under s12 FOIA might be invoked if applicable. We repeat our findings as set out above that much of that work was self created by their failure to deal with the request adequately in the first instance. Breadth. 18. The Commissioner argues that it is highly likely that compliance with the material request would lead to further requests. In assessing the breadth of the requests we repeat our finding that this was a case where the public authority ought to have provided advice or guidance on how to narrow or clarify the request. The Tribunal does not consider it fair to categorise this correspondence as individual and supplementary information requests but rather an attempt by Mr Chadha to identify how to frame his information request to obtain the information that he required in the absence of assistance from the Trust. The fact that Mr Chadha also asked for information on a second topic (namely the names and contact addresses Trust officials) does not in our judgment constitute an unacceptable breadth, being again a clearly defined topic which arose out of the Trust’s use of titles rather than names in correspondence. 19. When looking at the pattern and timing of requests, we acknowledge that some of the correspondence takes place by return (however, the same can also be said at times for the Trust’s response). We do not consider that this comes into the category of bombardment of emails envisaged in Dransfield: 11 letters from Mr Chadha in relation to the FOIA request in 6 months (including clarifications and chasers) in the context of misinterpretation of his requests and incomplete information from the Trust, in our view is neither excessive nor inappropriate. The motive of the requester. 20. From the content of the correspondence we are satisfied that his motive was to obtain the information he was seeking and not to cause disruption or harassment to the Trust. The Commissioner argued that this correspondence was “vexatiousness by drift” where an original and entirely reasonable request leads on to a series of further requests on allied topics, where such subsequent requests become increasingly distant from the requestors starting point. We 7EA/2013/0260 disagree. Dransfield acknowledges that there will be cases where disclosures are unclear or raise further questions that the requestor could not have foreseen. We are satisfied that this is the position in this case. The value or serious purpose of the request. 21. This is an objective public interest. The Trust has amended its position and accepts Mr Chadha has a genuine concern about the care received by his wife and this is likely to have been a catalyst for the requests. The Commissioner accepts that the requests serve the serious purpose of promoting transparency and accountability in relation to complaints data pertaining to the operation of a public authority which is ultimately responsible for the care of ill and vulnerable individuals. However, the Tribunal must consider the question of timing (a serious purpose may diminish over time) and whether the matter has already been exhaustively considered. In his reply the Commissioner argues that the request of 18th October 2012 represents the tipping point where the serious purpose no longer outweighs the significant burden. We reject this submission and are satisfied that Mr Chadha is still trying to find an acceptable formula to trigger disclosure of the information that he seeks. 22. Neither do we accept that the serious purpose of this request is diminished by Mr Chadha’s contact with the Trust in relation to his wife’s care. The Commissioner relies upon the Trust’s assertion that Mr Chadha “had not acted upon any of the advice he has been given, e.g. he was advised to make a formal written complaint so that an investigation could be carried out, but to date he has declined to do so.” We are satisfied that at the relevant date the matter had not already been exhaustively considered. These requests may have their genesis in Mr Chadha’s concerns relating to his wife’s care but their scope is wider and aimed at the general picture of the Trust’s level of complaints. We are not satisfied therefore that Mr Chadha’s prior dealings with the Trust that specifically relate to his wife are material to our consideration of this case. In any event we are satisfied from the correspondence provided at the Tribunal hearing, that contrary to the information provided at p95 of the bundle, Mr Chadha had attempted to complain to the hospital prior to the majority of these information requests10 in May 2012 and had been told this was no longer possible as he was out of time11. (A position which proved to be wrong as the Trust did in fact open an investigation which was concluded in December 201312). Conclusion and Remedy 23.

Dated this 3rd day of June 2014 4Appeal No: EA/2014/0012 Judge Chris Hughes [Signed on original] 5Appeal No: EA/2014/0012 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. On 2 November 2012 the Appellant in these proceedings, Mr Corke (a journalist), wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service asking for disclosure of information relating to decisions made over time not to prosecute Sir Cyril Smith (an MP who died in 2010) for offences against children. 2. The CPS responded on 26 April 2013 refusing to provide some information and maintained that position on review on 17 July, relying on section 30(1)(c) (information held for the purpose of criminal proceedings), section 40(2) (unfair disclosure of personal data) and section 42(1) (legal professional privilege). 3. Mr Corke complained to the Respondent, the Information Commissioner (“ICO”) who on 13 January 2014 upheld the CPS position. In weighing the arguments for and against disclosure under section 30(1)(c) he noted the importance of the protection of witnesses, the maintenance of the independence of the judicial and prosecution process and the unique role of the criminal court in determining guilt. 4. In favour of disclosure he noted that disclosure would enhance public understanding of the decision-making, (however noting that the CPS had already explained the thinking and explained that decisions taken in 1970 would not now be taken), that there was a greater interest in disclosure where justice was not seen to have been done, as was impossible given the death of Sir Cyril Smith, and noting that more information was available in the similar case of Sir James Savile. 5. In favour of maintaining the exemption the ICO noted the significance of maintaining the well-established safe space for the police and CPS to consider issues around prosecution and the danger that if such information was routinely disclosed the communication would be less full and CPS decision-making less well-informed, and that there was already considerable information available which meant that the public interest in disclosure was lessened. 6. The ICO concluded that the issue was finely balanced, noting the public concern about abuse of power and the apparent historic failure to prosecute high profile 6Appeal No: EA/2014/0012 figures. However he concluded that the public interest lay in protecting the decision- making of the CPS and concluded that “disclosure could well serve as a deterrent to [the CPS] documenting honest and frank views in the future. He also noted that disclosure would breach the rights of the victims by releasing personal information with respect to some parts of the information. Having made these decisions he did not consider the issue of legal professional privilege. 7. Mr Corke appealed on 14 January 2014 disputing the balance. In particular, he argued that there was simply no evidence that it would be the case that disclosure would deter the honest and frank documentation of such decisions. 8. In responding to the appeal the ICO reaffirmed his position and argued that there is “a credible causal link between routine disclosure of this kind of information and the reduction of record-keeping of candid views and conclusions in the future The Appellant has not sought to set out any reasons he may have about why such an event is not credible or causally linked. He further noted that the CPS had put out much information and explained the differences between the historic decision making and the situation today. 9. Mr Corke responded by pointing out that poor record keeping as a result of FOIA would be bad practice and that the ICO had given guidance to public authorities discouraging them from relying on the argument that disclosure would lead to poor record keeping. 10. The disputed material consists of two Minutes prepared by a CPS lawyer in 1998 and 1999. The first reviewed case papers considered in1970 and looked at the weight of the evidence, reflected on the changing approach to the investigation and prosecution of such crimes between 1970 and 1998 and considers bars to a prosecution being launched in 1998. The second considered two more allegations. The material contains the names of individuals concerned in the case in particular the youths who made allegations against Sir Cyril. The questions for the Tribunal 11. The over-arching issue for the Tribunal is how to strike the balance of public interest between the benefit of a full disclosure and the need to protect the deliberations of the CPS and Police as well as the personal data of the young people concerned. 7Appeal No: EA/2014/0012 12. The ICO has set out clearly the arguments on either side and Mr Corke has provided a succinct critique of the ICO’s reasoning. The ICO considered the issue finely balanced and recognised the significance of the public interest in disclosure of this complex matter. The Tribunal agrees. On this occasion the Tribunal is satisfied that the ICO has struck the balance the wrong way for two substantive reasons. 13. It seemed to the Tribunal that the ICO undervalued the professionalism and rigour of CPS lawyers in approaching the question of providing advice on the decision whether or not to prosecute – a task which goes to the heart of their professional duty. The Tribunal considered that this professionalism was a major protection against any such deviation into what Mr Corke referred to as “bad practice”. While it may be that there would be damage to the safe-space and the full and informed deliberation of difficult issues between CPS and police by the routine release of material of this nature; this release is anything but routine. It relates to events many years ago, and the disclosure of these Minutes illuminates the crimes and the police understanding of them in their historical context. They are in themselves significant historical documents which cast light on changes in the law as it has responded to the evolution of understanding of these crimes and changing social attitudes to them. They are further significant in the way they illuminate the character and actions of a significant public figure. 14. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the balance of public interests with respect to section 30 should be struck in favour of disclosure. 15. The Tribunal also considered the impact of disclosure on the very important public interests protected by S42. The Tribunal considered that in this case very similar considerations applied as with respect to S30. There was a need to ensure legal professional privilege was protected and the Tribunal considered the possible damage to legal professional privilege and the rights it protects by disclosure. In the light of the very unusual circumstances of this case the Tribunal concluded that the balance should be struck in the same way as for section 30 – the balance of public interest lay in disclosure since in the circumstances of the case there would be no significant harm either to the principle or the specific interest protected by S42. 16. The primary subject of these Minutes is now dead. The Tribunal noted that there is some material already in the public domain about cases concerning Sir Cyril Smith. 8Appeal No: EA/2014/0012 In order to protect the identities of all the young persons involved we have considered that redactions need to go beyond the usual identifiers. We consider that with the redactions indicated the identities and personal data of living individuals is protected and accordingly no objection to disclosure under section 40 arises. Conclusion and remedy 17. The Tribunal therefore finds that the decision of the ICO is not in accordance with the law and substitutes this decision. 18.

Relevant forms and guidance can found on the Tribunal’s website at www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/general-regulatory-chamber Signed Judge Hamilton 17 March 2014 -4-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1 Section 14 (1) of FOIA provides that: Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious 2 Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR states: (4) for the purposes of paragraph 1(1) a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that – (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable 3 In a preliminary consideration of this matter in September 2013 the Upper Tribunal ruled that the expressions ‘vexatious’ and ‘manifestly unreasonable’ were essentially the same and that a Tribunal should have regard to the same types of considerations in determining whether a request was vexatious or manifestly unreasonable. (GIA/3879/2012). The Disputed Information 4 The Tribunal was generally very concerned about the poor standard of preparation on the part of all the parties in relation to this appeal. This considerably hampered the full and proper consideration of the issues in the case. Both the submissions and the evidence were of a poor standard. There were items that the tribunal clearly needed to see (e.g. the complete set of emails submitted by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan during the relevant period; the resignation from the parish council clerk) which were simply not provided. The final set of submissions, which came from the parties after the main bundle had been prepared, was almost impossible -5-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 to follow. Representatives of the public authority had purported to insert comments into a document prepared by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan. Those comments were, apparently, colour-coded in blue and red. However the documents submitted to the Tribunal had been copied in black-and-white and it was almost impossible to see where comments were, let alone to understand who was making the comments. This was then compounded by Mr.and Mrs. Henegan commenting in turn upon the indecipherable comments in this document. Whilst the Tribunal can understand a litigant in person possibly struggling with what is required of them the Tribunal was very concerned by the apparent poor preparation on the part of the public authority and the Commissioner. 5 The problems this caused were apparent at the very outset when the Tribunal came to consider what information was actually in dispute here (the ‘disputed information’). The Tribunal first referred to the Commissioner's Decision Notice which ought, of course, to contain a clear statement of the disputed information. The Commissioner appears to deal with this issue paragraph 11 of the Decision Notice. However it is quite clear on reading through the list of enquiries made by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan, which are set out here, that several of the enquiries are not requests under the Freedom of information Act or the Environmental Information Regulations (e.g. ‘please can you advise of the date and location of the next council meeting?’). Some of the enquiries clearly are requests under FOIA/EIR and there is a third class of enquiry where it is quite ambiguous as to whether it is a FOIA/EIR enquiry or not (e.g. ‘I am still awaiting a copy of the council document that David Milton read out at July’s council meeting’). The Commissioner acknowledges this ambiguity (para 12 DN) but does not then go on to analyse and categorise the various requests. 6 The Tribunal also noted that there was also little agreement between the parties as to the extent of the enquiries covered by this appeal. As mentioned above the Commissioner described a set of enquiries running between 28 February 2011 and September 2011. However in an email -6-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 dated 18 October 2011, which appears at p128 of the bundle, Mr. and Mrs. Henegan refer to a more extensive list of unanswered enquiries - even though the period in question is the same as that considered by the Commissioner. Furthermore in a letter dated 21 October 2011 (p 132 bundle) sent by the public authority to Mr. and Mrs. Henegan the public authority refer to an even more extensive list of enquiries which appear to stem from the same period. 7 The Tribunal felt quite strongly that these issues should have been clarified before the hearing. The Tribunal noted that there had been attempts instigated by the Tribunal in 2012 to clarify these issues but no definitive response appears to have been received from the parties. Ultimately the Tribunal decided that they were confined to considering the information described in the original Decision Notice, as this is the decision that Mr. and Mrs. Henegan were appealing. The Tribunal also set aside requests which were clearly not FOIA/EIR requests but where the situation was unclear the Tribunal erred in favour of the Appellant and treated the request as a FOIA/EIR request. The Questions for the Tribunal 8 The Tribunal judged that the sole question for them was to consider whether the Appellant had proved on the balance of probabilities that his requests for information were not ‘vexatious’ within the meaning of s14(1) FOIA. Bearing in the mind the ruling of the Upper Tribunal in September 2013 in this case the Tribunal did not did not think it was also necessary to consider whether the enquiries were ‘manifestly unreasonable’ in accordance with the EIR. Evidence & Submissions 9 Subject to the comments already made The Tribunal considered all the evidence and submissions from the parties. -7-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 10 On the issue of ‘vexatious’ the Tribunal considered the guidance in the binding case of IC v Devon CC and Dransfield (‘Dransfield’) [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC). This invites a Tribunal to consider four broad (and overlapping) issues : The burden placed on the public authority and its staff The motive (of the requester) The value or serious purpose (of the request) Any harassment or distress (of and to staff) 11 In relation to the issue of the burden placed on the public authority the Tribunal were again rather hampered by the poor quality of the evidence submitted to the Tribunal. There was an often-repeated assertion in the papers that during a 3-week period in July 2011 Mr. and Mrs. Henegan had submitted 45 out of the total of 75 emails received by the public authority. The Tribunal accepted that, if correct, this had the potential to create a significant burden but the Tribunal was unable to conclude that it did so because no party had thought to provide copies of the emails. This omission was significant in the context of the appellant’s assertion that the public authority repeatedly failed to respond to enquiries and had to be chased and chased and also in the context of the appellant’s claim that they had been advised by the clerk to the public authority to use pester power – the implication being that unless they pressed for a response they wouldn’t receive any. Without the actual emails the Tribunal was unable to determine whether the ’45 email’ assertion was indeed correct and, if so, whether this was a reasonable tactic employed by the appellant or an unjustifiable burden placed on the public authority. The Tribunal noted that the public authority had prepared a schedule of emails sent by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan (p177 bundle) which totaled 78 in all but the dates of these were unclear as the schedule had been badly prepared and the dates were not complete. Again no copies of the emails were provided so an objective assessment of the ‘burden’ was not possible. 12 Because of all the uncertainty on this issue the Tribunal focused on the requests for information that were actually the subject of the Decision -8-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 Notice. The Tribunal concluded that on balance these were clearly not burdensome. The Tribunal noted that the Commissioner came to the same conclusion (para 39 Decision Notice). 13 The Tribunal felt that the motive of the requester and the serious purpose of the request were too closely linked in this particular case to be considered separately. 14 The Tribunal felt on balance that Mr. and Mrs. Henegan did have a serious purpose or motive in submitting enquiries to the public authority. This was two-fold and the purposes were sometimes overlapping. First, their motive was to persuade the council that it was in the council’s interests to sell the land in question to them so that the council was relieved of the burden of maintaining it. Secondly, in light of the council’s refusal to sell, the motive was to point out that the land was poorly maintained and to insist that the land was looked after properly. This may have been a purpose that principally benefitted the Henegans, rather than the broader community, but the Tribunal felt that this point did not render the purposes lacking in seriousness or mean that Mr. and Mrs. Henegan’s motives were questionable or malign. 15 In relation to the harassment and distress caused to the public authority’s staff by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan’s requests – the Tribunal felt that no clear evidence had been produced to support this claim. The Tribunal noted that there were assertions that the public authority’s clerk had resigned as a result of the Mr. and Mrs. Henegan’s correspondence but these assertions were not supported by clear evidence (e.g. a statement from the clerk or the letter of resignation – the Tribunal noted the Commissioner’s reasons for excluding the letter of resignation but felt that this could have been handled in a better way than simply excluding the letter – for example by redaction). The Tribunal also noted that the clerk in question had been convicted of fraud with the public authority as the victim. This factor alone must have placed a significant question mark over the clerk’s given reasons for leaving. -9-Appeal No.: EA/2012/0149 16 On balance the Tribunal did not consider that the public authority’s staff had been caused harassment or distress by Mr. and Mrs. Henegan’s enquiries. The Tribunal noted the Henegan’s generally friendly tone and their offers to help the clerk with certain tasks. The Tribunal also noted Mr. and Mrs. Henegan’s assertion that they had been encouraged by the clerk to use ‘pester power’. The Tribunal also noted that a number of the emails were clearly follow-up emails relating to unanswered enquiries. Conclusion 17 Having considered the Dransfield criteria the Tribunal was satisfied that on balance Mr. Henegan had established that he and his wife were not vexatious in their enquiries and that, consequently, the exception in s.14 FOIA was not available to the public authority. Bearing in the mind the ruling of the Upper Tribunal in September 2013 in this case the Tribunal did not find it necessary to go on and consider additionally whether the enquiries were ‘manifestly unreasonable’ in accordance with the EIR. 18 Our decision to allow this appeal is unanimous.

"208","Substantive Refusal","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 EA/2013/0191 B E T W E E N:- ALUN HUGHES Appellant -and- THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Tribunal Brian Kennedy QC Paul Taylor Henry Fitzhugh Hearing: Civil Courts, Vernon Street, Liverpool on Tuesday the 21st January 2014. Subject matter: Appeal under Section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Regulation 12 (5) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 generally and specifically whether exemption engaged and Public Interest test balance properly applied. DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL: The Tribunal grants the appeal in part directing disclosure of the disputed information with appropriate redaction. 1REASONS Introduction 1. The Appellant appeals under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the Act”), as incorporated by regulation 18 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“the Regulations”), against the Commissioner’s decision notice dated 5 August 2013 with the reference number FER0488228. Background 2. Playing fields exist at Ingleborough Road in Birkenhead, Merseyside (“the playing fields”). The pavilion on the site was built in memory of 88 Old Boys of the Birkenhead Institute School who fell in the First World War. 3. Tranmere Rovers Football Club (“TRFC”) has owned the playing fields since 1994. However, in recent years, TRFC was of the view that the playing fields were no longer meeting its needs. TRFC therefore sought planning permission to build on the playing fields. 4. At the same time, TRFC also submitted an additional planning application to redevelop Woodchurch Leisure Centre on Carr Bridge Road. 5. On 25 October 2012, Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council (“the Council”) granted outline approval for the two applications. Full approval is subject to planning conditions and the requirement for a s106 legal agreement. The Request 6. On 5 November 2012, the Appellant requested the following information from the Council: “I would like to have your responses please to the following 2 questions relating to [name redacted] – Principal Planning 2Officer within the Authority’s Department of Regeneration, Housing & Planning 1. What hospitality has the above Officer (and his line manager) declared as having been received by them within the last 5 years and from whom? 2. In his report to the Planning Committee on 25 October 2012 in respect of Planning Application reference OUT/12/00824, [name redacted] wrote the following on page 11, 6th paragraph, “a viability assessment has been submitted by the applicant, which has been independently assessed on behalf of the Council”. My request is, to know who the independent party that is referred to was and to see a copy of that advice”. 7. On 6 December 2012, the Council advised that it did not hold any information in response to the first limb of the request because neither individual had declared any hospitality in the last five years. 8. In response to the second limb of the request, the Council confirmed that Kinnear Miller Associates had carried out the independent assessment (“the Report”) of the viability assessment. The Council provided the conclusions and significant findings of the Report. The Council also reproduced the full paragraph from which the reference to the independent assessment of the viability assessment was referenced and which prompted part two of the Appellant’s request. This says: 3“…In this instance, a viability assessment has been submitted by the applicant which has been independently assessed on behalf of the Council. The independent review of the assessment has confirmed that, based on a land acquisition value identified by the applicant for the Ingleborough site of £5m, the residual appraisals preclude the inclusion of any affordable housing units. The applicant has outlined that it is proposed to use a proportion of the funds realised from the sale of Ingleborough to reduce Tranmere Rover’s debts (in addition to the delivery of replacement facilities at Carr Bridge Road)… …In summary, the viability assessment undertaken is considered to demonstrate that the development would not be viable should a requirement be imposed for affordable housing. That said, Members will be mindful that land acquisition values vary over time and as such it will be necessary to include a mechanism within a s106 Legal Agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, should the value rise significantly above that currently indicated and having regard to an up-to-date assessment of the viability of the site” 9. However, the Council advised that the remaining information in the Report was exempt from disclosure by virtue of section 43 of FOIA. 10. On 10 December 2012, the Appellant sought an internal review of the Council’s decision. The Appellant argued that the withheld information could not be commercially sensitive as Kinnear Miller was commenting on information in the planning application which was already in the public domain. 11. The Appellant contacted the Commissioner to complain that he had not received a response to his request for an internal review. The 4Commissioner asked the Council to provide the Appellant with an internal review of its initial refusal. 12. On 20 February 2013, the Council provided the Appellant with the outcome of its internal review. Firstly, it advised that it should have considered the requests under the Regulations. Secondly, it advised that it was citing regulation 12(4)(a) in relation to the first request and regulation 12(5)(e) in relation to the second request. 13. On 1 March 2013, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner. The Legal Framework 14. Under regulation 5(1) of the Regulations, a public authority is required to make environmental information available on request. 15. However, a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information under regulation 12(1) if (a) an exception to disclosure as set out at regulations 12(4) and/or 12(5) applies and (b) if, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 16. The relevant exception in this case is regulation 12(5)(e) which provides: “…a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect- (a) – (d) … (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest”. 5The Decision Notice 17. The Commissioner issued a decision notice on 5 August 2013, the subject of this appeal. 18. The Commissioner found that regulation 12(5)(e) was engaged. Further, the Commissioner went onto find that the public interest test favoured maintaining the exception. 19. This appeal addresses the balance of the public interest test as applied. Summary of the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal & the Commissioner’s Response 20. The Tribunal accept that the Commissioner has to consider the circumstances as they existed at the time of the request or by the time for statutory compliance with that request at the latest. Thus, the Commissioner has to consider the circumstances as they existed in this case in November 2012. Accordingly, any disputed information which can be said to be in the public domain by virtue of the Asset Management Report of 14 March 2013 cannot be taken into account for the purposes of reaching a decision on the appropriateness of the application of regulation 12(5)(e) at the time of the request. 21. In relation to the Planning Committee meeting of 25 October 2012; the Commissioner has correctly noted that the Appellant is in possession of and has provided a copy of the relevant report submitted to the Committee as Annex A to his Ground of Appeal. The Tribunal agree that the relevant minutes of that meeting are also publically available and that these were available at the time of the Appellant’s request. The Tribunal further accepts that the information contained in the Report is not reproduced in these publically available documents and thus maintains its confidentiality for regulation 12(5)(e) purposes. 622. The Commissioner properly acknowledged that the Appellant has been provided with a copy of the Report’s Conclusions and Significant Findings as well as a copy of the email from Kevin Adderley (Interim Director of Corporate Services at the Council) to Mr M Paddock (of the Paddock Johnson Partnership) dated 28 September 2011 referred to therein and that the Report also contained a copy of the Valuation Report undertaken by Mr Michael Honeybourne dated 1 July 2011. It has been accepted by the Commissioner that this was then currently available on the Council’s website and it appears from the document title that it was added on 1st June 2012 at 15:59. The Appellant was also in possession of the same as he included a copy at Annex D to his Notice of Appeal. 23. As such, the Commissioner accepted that this information could not be said to have the necessary quality of confidence and thus the exception was not engaged in respect of these documents. However, the Commissioner maintained that the remainder of the Report is not in the public domain and as such it retains the necessary quality of confidence. Thus, the Commissioner says that it was open and reasonable for him to find that regulation 12(5)(e) was engaged in respect of the remainder of the Report. This was not a significant dispute at the hearing before this Tribunal. 24. The Appellant says: “…The only other possible explanation for reluctance of Wirral to release the information could be that Kinnear Associates were subsequently told to downgrade the estimate of the works at Woodchurch from £5m to approx. £2.5m thus allowing for TRFC to make multi-million pound profit from the sale to reduce its debts. …If the profit that it is planned TRFC should make is the only financial figure which might thus be considered commercially sensitive, it does not justify the non-disclosure of the vast majority of the report…” 725. The Commissioner disputes that the only information which may be considered to be commercially sensitive is any reference to TRFC’s potential profit. Instead, the Commissioner maintains his position as set out at §19DN. However in the course of this appeal hearing, the Appellant has persuaded the Tribunal that what has been described as “TRFC’s own viability assessment” was either in the public domain as part of the planning application or was an additional document. We further accept his detailed argument that in either event the public interest in disclosure is greater. 26. The Commissioner argues; “…The report relates to on-going contractual negotiations between the public authority and TRFC. It is a detailed appraisal of the value of the site at Ingleborough Road and therefore linked to negotiations regarding the proposed section 106 agreement. The report is based on TRFC’s own viability assessment (which as far as the Commissioner understands had not been made public) of the site. The information relates to a potential agreement likely to affect the commercial interests of both parties and therefore possesses the necessary quality of confidence….” 27. The appellant argues that this is incorrect. He maintains there are no planning conditions attached to the resultant planning permission granted in respect of Ingleborough Road by Wirral Council, which link to land values at Ingleborough Road. He also points out that the only reference to a section 106 agreement contained in condition 19 makes it clear that such negotiations as this may throw up, are limited only to the provision of replacement playing fields at Carr Bridge Road and the timescales/delivery of same, not whether any subsequent increase in value of the land would justify an element of affordable housing being required at the Ingleborough Road site. On hearing the appellant on the detail of the background the 8Tribunal accept that in this case the public interest in disclosure outweighs the withholding of the disputed information. 28. The Appellant argues that the Commissioner has operated under the erroneous working assumption that the Appellant is confusing information contained in the Planning Report of 25 October 2012 with information in the Asset Management Report of 14 March 2013. This, the Appellant argues, meant the Commissioner erroneously limited his consideration of any public interest in disclosure of the Report to the public interest in disclosure of information concerning the linked development at Carr Bridge Road. 29. Instead, the Appellant says: “…In fact at the time of my original request and on the basis of the information publically provided at the planning committee meeting, Councillors and the public were being assured by the Planning Officer of the following: <U+F0B7> Sale of Ingleborough would raise £5m <U+F0B7> Replacement facilities at Woodchurch would cost £5m <U+F0B7> It was therefore the case that there was no profit to require any element of affordable housing to be provided by the developer, Tranmere Rovers Football Club (TRFC) <U+F0B7> An (unspecified) sum for the sale proceeds would however be released to TRFC to reduce its debts. It was entirely because this could not be made sense of that I sought to have the document in which the affordable housing situation was considered made public…” 930. The Commissioner says that as the Appellant had put forward particular arguments in respect of the Carr Bridge Road site; it was appropriate for the Commissioner to consider these points in his decision notice. 31. However, the Commissioner says that he has accepted that there is a broad public interest in disclosure of the requested information because it would shed light on the basis on which the Council granted outline planning permission for the two developments in light of the position outlined by the Appellant at §36DN. Disclosure, he suggests would therefore enhance transparency and accountability in relation to a transaction involving public funds and with the potential to have an impact on a significant number of local people. 32. The Commissioner also accepts that there is a public interest in the disclosure of information which would go to explain why it was agreed that affordable housing was not viable at the time of the request when a Council planning officer had suggested that there was a need for such housing provision. 33. However, the Commissioner considers that there is also a strong public interest in protecting commercially sensitive information, particularly, when high-value negotiations are on-going between the parties as they were at the time of the request in relation to the planning conditions and the section 106 agreement. 34. The Appellant has provided evidence which appears to show that the costs estimate for the works at Carr Bridge Road was around £5 million in July 2011 (see RMT estimate provided at Annex E to his Grounds of Appeal). 35. The Appellant has also provided evidence (Annex F to his Grounds of Appeal) which appears to suggest that the costs of the work at Carr Bridge Road were estimated, in October 2012, to be £2.5 million. However, he asks; “…The questions remains why therefore Kinnear Miller was sent a RMT feasibility cost breakdown for Woodchurch showing an anticipated spend of £5m there, if this was not the case and were asked [sic] to take this into account in 10considering the viability of providing affordable housing element at Ingleborough Road? In this context the comments of the Commissioner at Para 35 “The independent assessment was only with regards to the viability of affordable housing in the Ingleborough site” and the related comment at Para 41 “The independent report did not consider the viability of the proposed works at Woodchurch” are true only as far as they go. The cost of Woodchurch was a significant factor in determining whether affordable housing should be allowed to be avoided…” 36. The Appellant goes on to comment: “…There is substantial circumstantial evidence to suggest that the supposed justification for [the] non provision [of affordable housing] contained in the Kinnear Miller Associates report was not appropriate or accurate evidence to support the non-provision of affordable housing on Ingleborough site in the following 2012 resubmissions by TRFC. If this is correct it would be expected to lead to the conclusion that the planning decision taken by Councillors in October 2012 in respect of Ingleborough Road was based on an inaccurate (and some might think dishonest) recommendation for approval by the Planning Officer. As Councillors may have been potentially misled, this could have led to a flawed decision and one that deserves further investigation by the Local Government Ombudsman …” 37. The Commissioner has acknowledged that there is likely to be a public interest in the disclosure of any information which would go to explain the 11apparent discrepancy between the figures for the Carr Bridge Road development. 38. However, the Commissioner stands by the points set out at §35 and 41DN, namely, that the independent assessment of the viability assessment (the withheld information in this case) concluded that affordable housing was not viable at the Ingleborough site based on the amount of monies estimated to be raised by the sale of the land. It did not specifically consider the costs of or make recommendations on the feasibility of the development. 39. This the Commissioner argues is important because he has to consider whether or not the disclosure of the withheld information will go to meet any of the identified public interest factors in favour of disclosure. 40. The Commissioner will say that as the disclosure of the requested information would not go to explain the apparent discrepancy between the figures for the Carr Bridge Road development; then this argument does not add any further weight to the public interest factors in favour of disclosure. 41. The Appellant, at the hearing gave evidence in support of his contention that the Commissioner was wrong in his application of the Public Interest test being in favour of non disclosure of the withheld or disputed information. The arguments he developed are set out in page 160 – 163 of the hearing Bundle. Suffice to say on hearing these arguments, the tribunal were unanimously persuaded that the Appellant is correct that the Public Interest in the particular circumstances of this case lie in disclosure. 42. The following points made in submissions and expanded on presentation by the Appellant at hearing, in particular, have persuaded the Tribunal unanimously to allow this appeal: Reasons: 43. The Appellant argues with some merit that the Commissioner has made incorrect assumptions about the basis of his interest in securing sight of the Kinner Miller Associates report leading to an incorrect conclusion. He argues 12he was interested in an explanation why no affordable housing element was required when it appeared that TRFC would make sufficient profit to enable it to apparently reduce its debts. This we accept is a matter of significant public interest beyond the Appellant's own curiosity. 44. Information recently to hand indicated that the Commissioning of the report from Kinnear Miller Associates from Matthew Rushton was based solely on two documents already referred to and already in the public domain, namely a valuation report associated with planning application 11/00897 and a cost estimate associated with 11/00896 (this reference may be seen at Page 55 of the bundle). 45. The proposition placed before Kinnear Miller Associates by Matthew Rushton states quite clearly TRFC's argument that, “...affordable housing cannot be provided within the Ingleborough Road site because all of the capital released would be required to be invested in the replacement sports facilities”. Again, the Tribunal accept that this is a matter of significant weight in the argument of public interest being in favour of disclosure. 46. The Commissioner states that the Kinnear Miller Report is only a detailed evaluation of the value of Ingleborough Road and not of the feasibility of Carr Bridge Road yet, it is clear that the actual cost of the work at Carr Bridge Road in its entirety must be an element in considering the feasibility of affordable housing at Ingleborough Road. It is clear also that publically available information submitted in support of the Carr Bridge Road planning application indicated a works cost of £5m whilst it is now clear that the Council knew that the scope & cost of the work at Carr Bridge Road had been reduced to £2.5m (email 4.10.12) and although this was known by Officers prior to the Planning Committee on 25 October, Councillors were misled into believing the cost was £5m without this change being made known to them. This is a matter we accept should be fully and properly considered in the balancing exercise of the public interest test and which we find on hearing the oral submissions of the Appellant to be in favour of disclosure. 1347. The Appellant argues that the Commissioner was appearing to suggest that Kinnear Miller Associates received “TRFC’s own viability assessment” which was different to that referred to the Planning Committee. He argues that this considered alongside the failure to report altered costings in respect of the Carr Bridge Road proposals might amount to potential maladministration which they indicated was important and that they should have considered. The Appellant also pointed out reasons why there is no linkage between the Kinnear Miller report and Section 106 negotiations which undermines their non-disclosure argument further. In response to a further FOI request by the Appellant, he asserts the Council confirmed that the two publically available documents referred to in the commissioning letter to Kinnear Miller Associates (namely the Honeybourne Kenny & Partners valuation report and the cost estimate of £5m supplied by RMT) are the only documents supplied directly by the Council to the firm for consideration. 48. The Appellant argues that if further viability studies have been provided it must therefore be concluded that direct discussions must have taken place between the Club, its representatives and Kinnear Miller Associates with new information being supplied missing out Council Officers. This, he argues appears irregular if not unprofessional and, he argues, throws into question the competence of the Council Officers at the very least. The Appellant argues that it is now apparent that much manipulation of the figures has been going on such that the information and recommendation to Members of the Planning Committee cannot be relied upon. This is explained further and articulated in the summary of the Appellant’s reply to the response by the Commissioner. 49. The Appellant attests that his interest in this matter is not gratuitous. His concern is that it appears that important and relevant matters of detail are being hidden from elected Councillors who will have been impaired in their judgement as a result. The Appellant asks the Tribunal to make the report and associated documents available to scrutiny by the public so that any apparent decision to disadvantage the inhabitants of the Borough through the loss of important affordable housing provision whilst allowing a private company to 14make a potentially multi million pound profit, may be properly discussed in the open and if necessary allow the full facts to be reported back to elected officials. 50. Conclusion: The Tribunal accepts that the Commissioner did not have the benefit of hearing the Appellant at this appeal and direct a substituted decision that the withheld information be disclosed subject to any request for redaction of names where appropriate.

Action Required As detailed above. Robin Callender Smith Judge 29 January 2014 -4-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2013/0188 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant requested a copy of an incident report regarding the use of force against a particular individual at the Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre. 2. The Home Office originally withheld the requested information in its entirety on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA, the personal data exemption. 3. During the course of the Commissioner's investigation the Home Office disclosed a redacted version of the report. The Commissioner is satisfied that the redacted parts of the report are exempt on the basis of section 40(2). The request for information 4. Having received a response to a previous FOI request regarding complaints made by detainees at the Cedars Family Detention House (the Cedars), the Appellant submitted the following request to the Home Office on 28 September 2012 : Previously earlier with this FOI you have explained that the large number of complaints has given difficulties to sharing the requested information. You now offer 3 complaints [and the Appellant then focussed more specifically on the one involving Tinsley House which arose from the Home Office response in the further indented quoted figures below]. Please provide all the ibnformation [sic] on the incident using force and the 86 complaints of 2011. -5-""During our reporting period there was only one reported occasion where the need for use of force was used in the Family Suite. Type of Complaint 2011 2010 2009 Food 25 2 Missing property 15 20 Medical 9 9 Staff conduct 4 6 Fellow detainees 8 Other 25 10 TOTAL 86 47 55"" 5. The Appellant was contacted by the Home Office on 24 October 2012. It explained that it needed further time to consider the balance of the public interest test. Then, on 21 November 2012, the Home Office indicated to the Appellant that it was prepared to disclose redacted copies of the 86 complaints made by detainees at Tinsley House, along with the responses to these complaints. 6. During the course of the Commissioner's investigation, on 9 July 2013, the Home Office provided the Appellant with a redacted version of the information relating to the incident [involving the use of force]. 7. It explained that redactions had been made on the basis of section 40(2). The complaint to the Information Commissioner 8. The Appellant originally contacted the Commissioner on 14 February 2013 in order to complain about the Home Office's handing of his request. Following the Home Office's further disclosure of information on 9 July 2013, the Commissioner established with the Appellant that - although he did not dispute the Home Office’s decision to redact the individual's names from the requested information, he considered the level of redaction was excessive. -6-9. The Commissioner considered whether the information redacted from the incident report (with the exception of the individual's names) was exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA. 10. Section 40(2) of FOIA stated that personal data was exempt from disclosure if its disclosure would breach any of the data protection principles contained within the Data Protection Act (DPA). The Home Office argued that disclosure of the redacted information would be unfair and thus breach the first data protection principle which stated that: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless - (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met. 11. For section 40(2) to be engaged the information being withheld had to constitute 'personal data ' which is defined by the DPA as : ...data which relate to a living individual who can be identified (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intention of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual. 12. The Home Office explained that the 'Tinsley House Independent Monitoring Board 2011 Annual Report', which was published on the Ministry of Justice website provided a summary of the incident in question, confirming force was used against a mother holding her child due to her aggressive behaviour. The Home Office confirmed that the unredacted parts of the report in the version that was provided to the Appellant was the information that was used to create that summary. -7-13. The Commissioner appreciated that the Appellant had accepted that redaction was necessary in respect of the names of the individuals concerned. 14. The Commissioner had considered whether disclosure of the report, simply with the individuals' names redacted, would still constitute the disclosure of personal data. Could the redacted information still be used to identify the family in question even without their names being disclosed? 15. He concluded that it could still identify them and that it would breach the first data protection principle. Individuals being processed at detention centres such as Tinsley House had a strong and reasonable expectation that details of their detention would not be disclosed under FOIA. The appeal to the Tribunal 16. Précising the Appellant’s grounds of Appeal and arguments, he believes that there has been over-redaction. 17. He puts it succinctly: The claim by the Home Office that 40 (2) of the FOIA should apply to such a dispiritingly amount is in my view clearly translatable as using the law to hide bad news from the public and by doing so undermines its high aims. Not sharing threat present shared information could also show an aim to keep the information from the public eye. 18. He noted that there had been 20 unnatural deaths of detainees whilst detained within or travelling to or from removal centres to date with many more attempted suicides and acts of self-harm. The use of forcible restraint whilst detained caused the death of a detainee. 19. It was very much in the public interest that there was as little redaction of identifying detail in this case as possible. -8-The questions for the Tribunal 20. Has there been over-redaction in respect of the requested information supplied to the Appellant? 21. Does the public interest justify greater disclosure of the personal data in this case? Evidence 22. The Tribunal has seen all of unredacted information in the incident report and been able to compare it to the redacted version supplied to the Appellant. 23. The Tribunal is conscious that, inevitably, this portion of the process excludes the Appellant. However the Tribunal applies rigorous critical standards in respect of the public interest in this area. Conclusion and remedy 24. The Appellant believes that the currently redacted information could be disclosed because, with the names redacted, there would be sufficient anonymisation for the report not to reveal personal data. 25. The Tribunal, having looked at the totality of the data currently disclosed and the information and personal data withheld, has concluded that – by keeping redacted the names of those involved, the time/date on which the incident occurred, the nationality of the family involved and the family’s national language - the personal data of those involved in the incident is properly and proportionately protected. 26. There is a clear public interest in members of the public generally understanding the kind of event that can occur in immigration detention -9-centres both at the time this event occurred and as immigration issues remain a focus of general interest. 27. The Tribunal finds that, by keeping redacted the information mentioned in Paragraph 24, it would not be possible for the individuals concerned to be identified save among themselves as they already know that information. 28. The Tribunal is aware that – in addition to the Data Protection Act principles – there are particular duties in respect of the welfare of children and their best interests imposed on courts generally by s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 linked with respect for their ECHR Article 8 private life rights. 29. These have been emphasised particularly by Baroness Hale in her phrase in the Supreme Court decision of ZN (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 that the “best interests of the child must be a primary consideration. This means that they must be considered first.” 30. To name the family in question and identify its nationality could potentially prejudice the best interests and welfare of the children of the family. 31. The proportionate approach is to permit the generality of the information to be revealed without such identifiers. 32. The incident and details here – without the personal information that will remain redacted (and this includes the identities of all involved both staff and family) - remains sufficiently generic but yet allows the public to have an understanding of what happened within the event itself. 33. Our decision is unanimous. - 10 -34. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 29 January 2014 - 11 -"

Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000 generally and also, specifically whether section 40(2) exemption engaged. 1DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL: The Tribunal grants the appeal in part. REASONS: Introduction 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the Act”) generally and also specifically in relation to exemptions claimed under section 40(2). 2. The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner, who is the First Named Respondent, (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the Decision Notice”) dated 16th January 2013 (reference FS50461773). 3. The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat on the 19th August 2013 and decided the case after an oral hearing where the Appellant represented himself and the Second Respondent (“the CCEA”) and their witnesses were represented by a Peter Hopkins of counsel instructed by Carson McDowell, solicitors. Request by complainant: 4. The complainant wrote to the second respondent on 27th June 2012, with the following request: “Under the Freedom of Information Act, I would like to be provided with the documentation relating to those checks for the GCE Mathematics papers C4, M1, M4, S1 and S2 papers”. 5. By letter dated the 27th June 2012 the CCEA disclosed a copy of the information it maintained was held, (though with the names of the individuals undertaking the checks of the examination papers withheld), 2relying upon the exemption under Section 40(2) of the Act. The CCEA advised that a further check on Mathematics was carried out by a Professor from Queen’s University Belfast though advised that no formal documentation of this process was held. It later transpired that these subsequent checks were not carried out by a University Professor but by a Doctorate/teacher. 6. Following an internal review, the CCEA disclosed to the Appellant a copy of the front page of each of the mathematics papers requested which were signed as confirmation that the requested checks had been completed. The copies were redacted in part. CCEA advised that a verbal report was given to the subject officer for Mathematics following the completion of the checks and that the front covers of each paper are the only documents held on record in relation to the completed checks. The CCEA withheld the name of the individual who undertook the checks, under section 40(2). The Commissioner’s Decision: 7. The Commissioner served a Decision Notice dated the 16th January 2013 in relation to this matter in accordance with Section 50 of the Act. The Commissioner decided that CCEA has provided the Appellant with all information it holds within the scope of his request other than the withheld information to which it has correctly applied Section 40(2). Grounds of appeal: 8. The Appellant claims to demonstrate that there were serious errors in the GCE Mathematics papers, the subject matter of his request. He understandably argues that students undertaking the exams in question inter-alia would have been disadvantaged by the errors he identified. He cannot accept that the checks which would or should have exposed these errors have not been recorded and the detail of the results recorded on documents which were retained by the CCEA. 39. The Appellant also argues that the name of the expert undertaking the checks in question and the dates of checking should be disclosed on the disclosed documents. This is because, in his opinion, there needs to be capacity for scrutiny as to whether someone employed at public expense could be regarded as having the appropriate experience and qualifications for the task. 10. At hearing the parties helpfully agreed the grounds of appeal were essentially: a) Whether or not any information held by the CCEA at the time of the request and within the scope of the request has not been disclosed and b) Does the exemption under Section 40(2) apply to the name of the expert/s engaged in the checks. Tribunal's Reasons: 11. In relation to the first ground a) The Tribunal accept the submissions of the Appellant that the date on the front pages disclosed to him are important and should not have been redacted. We find as a fact that the date should have been disclosed and we direct that this matter is now properly disclosed to the Appellant. 12. In relation to the second ground, i.e. does the exemption under Section 40(2) apply to the name of the academic engaged in the checks, in the course of the hearing the Appellant effectively abandoned his argument and seemed to accept the reasoning for redaction of the name on the front page of the examination papers disclosed. At the hearing he did not argue against the redaction of the name. He distinguished the date which he argued in itself was important. In any event and for the avoidance of doubt the Tribunal accepts the need for redaction and accepts that in the particular circumstances of this case and for the reasons given by both respondents, Section 40(2) is engaged. This is an absolute exemption and accordingly this Tribunal rules redaction of the name on the front page of the said examination papers disclosed remain redacted. 413. The Appellant argues that such an important matter should have given rise to more notes and recorded discussion, analysis and or comment. He cannot accept that all or any written records had not been retained by the time of his request. The Tribunal understands this concern and doubt. An important matter of such concern to so many exam candidates should be a matter of significant public interest and one would expect some record of the tests or checks carried out by any expert to be recorded. It seems to the Tribunal that the Appellant has a genuine and legitimate concern that such a failure to permanently record particulars of the checks might well be perceived as a cover up and not in the public interest. The Appellant further strongly objected to the CCEA not having been engaged in the formal process of this appeal until as late as August 2013. Evidence: 14. An aide memoir was released to the Appellant in the course of his complaint to the Commissioner but it is not disputed that this document was created after the date of the request and therefore is not the subject of this appeal. The CCEA called two witnesses to explain the background to the limited disclosure of information available at the time of the request. The first was Phyllis Rolleston whose witness statement is on record. Ms. Rolleston took the oath and under cross examination she confirmed that she had not asked the expert if he had made written notes as she had not in fact met him. She confirmed that any expert would be escorted to their office for checks and it would not be the custom or practice to allow any papers, including notes, out of this office. She was questioned about the witness statement provided to the Tribunal by Mr. Joe McGurk, Officer for Mathematics and Business Assurance for the CCEA and Mr. McGurks’ comment that he anticipated that expert’s notes had been destroyed. Her evidence was that Mr. McGurk told her he had made no notes of his discussions with the experts. When questioned further she indicated that she did not know if any notes were made or destroyed by any expert. She told the Tribunal that she could not shed any light on this point except that it was a very confidential process and only a small team consisting of six 5persons would be involved. She explained that she had dealt with the team leader, a senior executive officer and spoke to this person within a day or two of the Appellant's request. She confirmed the testimony of the team leader is that the expert produced no notes or documents after his checks. She did concede that she felt it was a matter of concern that there is no record and she would be making recommendations. She accepted under cross examination that she could see no need for the redaction of the date on the front pages disclosed. 15. The second witness called by the second respondent was Mr. Martin Quinn, Director of Corporate Services at the CCEA, whose formal statement is on record and who took the oath and was cross examined by the Appellant. He stated that he had been too busy to provide clarification to the Appellant upon his request. He did not have time. Later when asked by the Appellant about post request comments written by Mr. Quinn he was unaware of how many times an emergency of this type (urgent interim measures for carrying out exam paper checks) had occurred. He did not know why the date had been redacted from pages disclosed and stated that he would not have redacted it. In general the Tribunal found Mr Quinn unable to assist in any of the pertinent details as he seemed to rely on staff to advise him about all the relevant matters pertaining to the request. He was of little assistance. He seemed to regard the Appellant’s request as a nuisance and bordering on vexatious. 16. The Tribunal find it unfortunate that Mr. McGurk was not available to give evidence although on balance we accept that his absence is because he is unwell at this time. 17. Accordingly, and for the reasons given above, this Tribunal finds that the second respondent failed to provide all information within the scope to the request at the time of the request. The dates should not have been redacted and this information should now be provided in its’ original form. Otherwise however we have not been persuaded that there was other documentation at the time of the request. That is not to say that this is a 6satisfactory position but we are not here to determine that issue. Having heard Ms. Rolleston, who was a most helpful witness, under extensive and effective cross examination by the appellant, we are satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that there probably was no other documentation within the scope of the request at the time she investigated it, that is within two days of the request being made. Conclusion: 18. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal allows this appeal in part. The requested information (the redacted dates) should be disclosed. 19. The parties have the right to apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application must be made to the Tribunal in writing within 28 days of this decision.

That general obligation is however subject to a number of exceptions. 2 Under Regulation 12(4)(b) EIR a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information if the request is ‘manifestly unreasonable’ and in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Regulation 12(1)(b)). 3 Regulation 12(2) EIR requires a public authority to apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. 4 Unsurprisingly, there is no binding definition of ‘manifestly unreasonable’. However its meaning has been held as essentially the same as the meaning of ‘vexatious’ under section 14 FOIA (see Craven v IC & DECC [2012 UKUT 442 (AC) at 30). 5 The leading case on the meaning of vexatious is now IC v Devon County Council & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AC). 6 The Upper Tribunal's analysis of section 14 FOIA is set out at paragraphs 24 to 39 of Dransfield. Whilst neither exhaustive or to be used as a formulaic checklist the Upper Tribunal found that it may be helpful to consider four broad issues: the burden (on the public authority and its staff); the motive (of the requester); the value or serious purpose (of the -5-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0008 request) and any harassment or distress (of and to staff). The Commissioner’s Decision 7 The Information Commissioner in his Decision Notice (DN) of 10 December 2012 has correctly set out the chronology leading up to this appeal. The DN dealt with matters other than the subject of this appeal. The only matter considered by the Tribunal was whether Cornwall Council was correct to rely on the ‘manifestly unreasonable’ exemption (and the associated public interest test) in refusing to respond to the enquiries submitted by Mr Yeoman on behalf or Newquay Regeneration Forum Ltd as set out in paragraph 6 of page 3 of the Decision Notice of 10 December 2012. The Appeal to the Tribunal 8 The Tribunal was unclear as to the date on which the Appellant submitted an appeal to the Tribunal (IRT). In the bundle before them the Tribunal had Grounds of Appeal dated 25 February 2013 but were unclear whether this was the original or refined GOA that the Appellant was directed to file. In any event the Tribunal unfortunately found Mr Yeoman’s submissions to be unnecessarily lengthy, complex and dense. The Tribunal struggled to understand all the points Mr Yeoman was seeking to make and the Commissioner’s findings that he disputed. The Tribunal was able to glean that Mr Yeoman disputed the Commissioner’s finding that the specific request was manifestly unreasonable and the Commissioner’s decision that the public interest test favoured non-disclosure. The Questions for the Tribunal 9 The Tribunal decided that the first question for them to answer was whether Mr Yeoman’s requests for information could, on balance, properly be characterised as manifestly unreasonable bearing in mind the -6-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0008 guidance given in Dransfield. 10 The Tribunal further decided that it would only be necessary for them to consider the public interest test in Regulation 12(1)(b) if they first found the requests to be manifestly unreasonable. Evidence & Submissions 11 This matter was considered by the Tribunal by way of an paper hearing. Extensive written submissions were received from the Commissioner and Mr Yeoman. No submissions were received from the public authority and it was not altogether clear to the Tribunal whether or not the public authority had been joined as a second respondent. 12 In his decision notice the Commissioner referred to a number of factors which he took into account in reaching his decision that Mr Yeoman's requests were manifestly unreasonable and that the public interest test favoured non-disclosure: a) The length of time that it would have taken the public authority to respond to the requests. The public authority estimated the time at 28 hours 47 mins. The Commissioner felt this to be a reasonable estimate. b) The Commissioner took account of the effective time limits in relation to FOIA applications – the relevant time limit for such a public authority being 18 hours. The Commissioner acknowledged that there was no similar effective time limits in the EIR but nonetheless felt that the time estimate was so far in excess of the FOIA limit as to render the request ‘clearly unreasonable’. c) In concluding that the public interest test favoured non-disclosure the Commissioner again relied on the time that responding to the -7-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0008 request would take and the disruption that would be caused to the public authority in carrying out its ‘core duties’ The Commissioner indicated that he considered the public interest in this case to be ‘finely balanced’. 13 As previously mentioned the tribunal found it a little hard to understand certain aspects of Mr Yeoman’s submissions. In relation to the time estimate for dealing with request 6 Mr Yeoman did not dispute the estimate but did dispute that this led to an inference that his request was manifestly unreasonable. 14 in relation to the public interest test Mr Yeoman asserted that the public interest in 'transparency right across the planning obligation process’ should be given priority over the public interest in the public authority not being distracted from its core functions. Conclusion 15 Bearing in mind the submissions of the parties and considering the four broad issues raised in Dransfield the Tribunal concluded that the only issue between the parties in relation to the question of whether the requests were manifestly unreasonable was the issue of the burden on the public authority in terms of the time it would take to deal with the request. 16 There was not a complete consensus within the Tribunal on this issue. After considerable deliberation the Tribunal concluded, on balance, in this particular case that the Commissioner’s analysis was correct and that the length of time to respond to this request did render the request manifestly unreasonable. The Tribunal noted that there was no dispute as to the time estimate and, indeed, concluded that the time estimate appeared to be conservative. -8-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0008 17 The Tribunal was not assisted however by the Commissioner’s references to the effective time limits imposed in relation to FOIA requests. The Tribunal did not think that it was appropriate to try and import such time limits over into the EIR framework. Such time limits are entirely missing from the EIR and the Tribunal felt that this was a fairly compelling indication that the FOIA time limits were not a pertinent consideration in relation to EIR applications. 18 The Tribunal then went on to consider the public interest test. The Tribunal felt that the Commissioner had given far too little weight to the factors favouring disclosure. The Tribunal felt that there was a manifest public interest in having the information sought released so that the public would know about the amount of money (or other obligations) associated with s.106 agreements (defined on page 2 of the Commissioner’s DN) and the potential benefit they might have for the public. Disclosure would also allow members of the public to check when commitments under s.106 agreements were due to arise and to check whether developers were meeting their commitments and were doing the things they had agreed to do. The Tribunal considered that collating and publicising such information should in fact be a core function of the public authority rather than being seen as a distraction. The Tribunal also felt that the Commissioner focused too much on the public interest in local businesses knowing the details of s106 agreements. The Tribunal felt that the sought information would be of far wider public interest including to residents of, as well as businesses in, the particular area. 19 The Tribunal was also concerned that the Commissioner sought to use the same reason (the length of time it would take to answer the request) to satisfy the ‘manifestly unreasonable’ criterion and to contend that the public interest favoured non-disclosure. In the Tribunal’s view the criteria for arguing that the public interest favoured non-disclosure should be something distinct from the reasons for arguing that the request was manifestly unreasonable. Otherwise the public interest test, which is -9-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0008 clearly something additional to the ‘manifestly unreasonable’ hurdle, becomes synonymous with rather than distinct from that hurdle. 20 Consequently, the Tribunal concluded that, on balance, Mr Yeoman's request could properly be characterised as manifestly unreasonable but also concluded that the public interest strongly favoured disclosure.

Action Required The public authority disclose the requested information to the complainant within 35 days. Dated this 29th day of April 2013 Judge Chris Hughes [Signed on original] 3Appeal No: EA/2012/0250 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. On 8 May 2012 the Appellant in these proceedings (Mr Dicker) wrote to requested information concerning the remuneration of the chief executive of the public authority:- “ can you please disclose the details of the salary paid to the Chief Executive officer ( CEO) for NHS Surrey ( Surrey PC T ) for the following periods : <U+F0B7> 30-31 March 2010 <U+F0B7> 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 <U+F0B7> 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 I would like this information in the form of a month by month salary breakdown followed by a breakdown of the following information: <U+F0B7> benefits <U+F0B7> appropriate expenses by type <U+F0B7> pension contributions <U+F0B7> total remuneration"" 2. The initial response by the public authority was to provide links to its annual reports and to indicate that the requested information for 2011-12 would be published in the annual report due in July 2012. Mr Dicker was dissatisfied with this in particular he considered that the information published in the annual report which published salary information by reference to salary band was not the precise information requested. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 3. Mr Dicker complained to the Information Commissioner; during the course of his investigation the public authority agreed that the information requested would not be published in the annual report and therefore section 22 of FOIA ( the information 4Appeal No: EA/2012/0250 sought with information intended for future publication ) did not apply. The public authority therefore sought to rely on section 40 (2) FOIA - that information is exempt from disclosure if it constitutes the personal data of a third party and one of the conditions listed in section 40(3) or 40(4) is satisfied. 4. The Commissioner concluded that the public authority was relying on s.40(3)(a)(i) – that it was third party information and disclosure would contravene the principles of the Data Protection Act. He concluded that the salary details and other specific information of the CEO fell within the description of personal data and related directly to an identified person – the CEO. 5. The Commissioner then reviewed whether disclosure of the information would be in breach of the first data protection principle – that processing of data should be fair and lawful. To do this he reviewed three factors – whether disclosure would cause any unnecessary or unjustified damage or distress to the individual concerned, that individual’s reasonable expectations of what would happen to such information and balancing the rights and freedoms of the data subject with the legitimate interests which would be served by the disclosure. 6. The Commissioner recognised the reality of the situation that very senior public servants could expect a certain amount of information about their actions to be disclosed and he considered that:- “the CEO would expect some details of their salary to be placed in the public domain but it is also reasonable to assume they would not expect their exact salary details to be made publicly available.” He noted the guidance he has published on this issue “salary information relates to people’s personal financial circumstances and disclosure of the exact salary of an individual is more intrusive than giving a salary band… it may also prejudice the individual’s interests in ongoing financial or legal negotiations.” He noted:- “Disclosure of the exact details would clearly lead to a greater infringement into the privacy of the individuals as it would reveal the specific details of the person’s 5Appeal No: EA/2012/0250 financial situation. It is therefore reasonable to consider that disclosure of this information would cause the individual unwarranted distress or unjustified damage.” He concluded that:- “disclosure of the exact salary information would lead to a greater infringement of the individual’s legitimate right to privacy than is outweighed by the legitimate public interest in disclosure. This is because the Commissioner accepts that there is already significant information provided in bands by NHS Surrey to allow for public scrutiny and there appears to be no circumstance which creates any greater need for the public to know the specific salary information in this case.” The appeal to the Tribunal 7. Mr Dicker was not satisfied with this decision and has challenged it. He disputed that accurate information about salary bandings was given by the public body, he claimed that the salary actually paid was in excess of the national guidance on NHS salaries and he claimed that it was in the public interest for that departure from national pay guidance to be revealed. 8. The Commissioner resisted the appeal emphasised that the test for disclosure of personal information was driven by consideration of data protection principles. The first stage was:- “Whether disclosure is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by parties to whom the data are disclosed” 9. If that test was passed a second test had to be considered before deciding that disclosure was permissible; that laid down by Schedule 2 condition 6 of the Data Protection Act of whether it is:- “unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 10. The right to which the Commissioner drew attention was :- “the right of a data subject not to have their personal data disclosed to the public where such disclosure may cause unwarranted distress” 6Appeal No: EA/2012/0250 11. He noted that there was a remuneration committee to oversee pay arrangements and ensure regularity. He concluded that the disclosure was not necessary and would interfere with the private life of the CEO. He maintained his opposition to disclosure. The questions for the Tribunal 12. The questions before the Tribunal were how the tests laid down by the Data Protection Act should be applied in considering the request for disclosure under FOIA, in other words, had the Commissioner come to the correct conclusions with respect to these tests. 13. The Commissioner recognised a legitimate public interest in the public being satisfied that the arrangements for pay were transparent and subject to suitable scrutiny, but that further information was not necessary beyond the publication of banding information which he recommends. In his published guidance (“When should salaries be disclosed” ICO February 2009) the Commissioner noted that salary exact disclosure was sometimes justified in exceptional circumstances for example “there are current controversies” and “the individual in question is paid significantly more than the usual salary for the post”. In this case the arrangements (including secondment and recharge from another public authority at one stage) mean that the arrangements are not as transparent as might be wished and it is not entirely clear from the information published (as opposed to the assurances given) that the national pay guidance has been complied with. Mr Dicker asserted that the CEO was paid in excess of the national framework. The Tribunal was satisfied that there was a legitimate public interest in demonstrating that the national framework had been complied with and that the published information did not properly establish this. 14. The issue with respect to the detail of any actual harm or distress caused to the CEO was also problematic. In simple terms details of the CEO salary are in the public domain. While there is a dispute between Mr Dicker and the Commissioner about precisely what is available and its significance the broad level of pay of the CEO is published. The information does not have the detail and the precision which Mr Dicker has asked for (precise figures, rather than in salary banding done on intervals of £5,000), but some information is there. The CEO is a prominent public servant discharging heavy responsibilities who must expect to be scrutinised. Individuals in 7Appeal No: EA/2012/0250 such circumstances are rational, efficient, hard-working and robust. They are fully entitled to a high degree of respect for their private lives. However the protection of personal information about their families and their health is a very different matter from having in the public domain information about income which in one form would be (to use hypothetical figures) in a band between £140,000 and £145,000; and in another £141,234.95. The Tribunal simply cannot accept that anyone in such a role would feel the slightest distress, or consider that there has been any intrusion or that they would be prejudiced in any way by such information. From the perspective of the individual such information is essentially trivial; indeed, in other European societies, such information would be routinely available. Conclusion and remedy 15. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Commissioner erred in his decision notice and directs the disclosure of the requested information. 16. Our decision is unanimous [Signed on original] Judge C Hughes 29 April 2013 8"

SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated: 24 April 2013 Public authority: Carmarthenshire County Council Address of Public authority: County Hall Carmarthen SA31 1JP Name of Complainant: Ms Julie White The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Tribunal allows the appeal and substitutes the following decision notice in place of the decision notice dated 16 October 2012. Action Required: Within 31 days of the service of this Substituted Decision Notice the Second Respondent should supply the Appellant with the information requested. Robin Callender Smith Judge 24 April 2012 -2-REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant in this case made an information request for an up-to-date list of licensed dog breeders in Carmarthenshire. 2. The requirement to obtain a licence – and the conditions that a breeder should formally meet to obtain the licence – comes from the Breeding Dogs Act 1973 and the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Act 1999. There is a related statute, the Breeding Dogs Act 1991, which amends the 1973 Act to allow certain additional rights of entry for investigating officials. Local authorities have a statutory duty to apply the regulations. The request for information 3. On 17 October 2011 the Appellant wrote to Carmarthenshire County Council as follows: Please could you advise me which department is responsible for licensing puppy farming in Carmarthenshire? And would it be possible to send me a list of those premises which are licensed. 4. The Council’s Animal Health Department replied on 27 October 2011 stating that it currently had 88 establishments licensed under the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 in Carmarthenshire. At that stage the Appellant made an information request to the Council: Please be kind enough to provide me with details under the Freedom of Information Act. I would like a current/up-to-date list of licensed dog breeders in the Carmarthenshire County. Or, those who have been licensed by Carmarthenshire LA. 5. The Council confirmed on 14 November 2011 that it did hold the requested information but considered that it was exempt under s. 40 (2) of FOIA. On 21 December 2011 the Appellant asked for an internal review and was told, on 23 January 2012, that the review had upheld the decision that the requested information was exempt under s. 40 (2) FOIA. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. In the Decision Notice, the Information Commissioner’s investigation focused on whether the Council was correct to rely on section 40 (2) to -3-withhold the names of the licensed dog breeders in the Carmarthenshire area. Living individuals could be identified from their name and address and, the Commissioner concluded, those clearly constituted “personal data”. 7. The Commissioner then considered whether disclosure of the names and addresses of the licensed dog breeders would contravene any of the Data Protection Act 1998 principles. He considered whether disclosure of the names and addresses would be “fair” taking into account the reasonable expectations of breeders and the potential consequences of disclosure. 8. He noted that: a. Information about an individual’s private life deserved more protection than information relating to an official work capacity. b. While the information related to the individuals’ business activities, that business was conducted from their private homes and touched on their private lives. There was no requirement for a public register of licensed dog breeders although dog breeders were required to display a copy of the license at their premises. c. The local police had advised some licensed dog breeders not to display the licences too prominently because of previous incidents of threats, acts of criminal damage and violence to other dog breeding establishments in the area. Very few licensed dog breeders sold to the public. d. Most of the breeders who were consulted by the Council objected to the disclosure of their names and addresses. 9. Although individuals might have a reasonable expectation about disclosure or any damage and distress caused to them by disclosure, the Commissioner accepted that it might still be fair to disclose the requested information if it could be argued that there was a more compelling public interest in disclosure. In relation to that he had noted: a. The welfare of animals, particularly the welfare of dogs, was an emotive subject. The police had informed the Council that, in recent years, there had been incidents of targeting of dog breeders’ properties resulting in criminal damage and a risk to public safety. b. Because of instances of animal extremist activity in Carmarthenshire, including criminal damage, threats of violence, and trespassing, the Council introduced a policy not to pro-actively publish names and addresses of the licensed dog breeders. That policy had been introduced in 2008 and was kept under review. Prior to that the Council did publish the details of licensed dog breeders. -4-c. During the Commissioner’s investigation that policy was specifically reviewed by the Council and retained. d. The Council had the highest number of licensed dog breeders in the UK. It believed there was evidence that the area was being singled out by animal welfare extremists including people travelling from other parts of the United Kingdom to make undercover visits to licensed dog breeders in the county. e. The Council held a consultation with the licensed dog breeders during the course of the Commissioner’s investigation. Of those who responded, 90% stated they did not want the information released. Those responses referred to examples of previous incidents to support the concern of the breeders for their safety. f. There was a significant reference on animal welfare websites to “puppy farms in Carmarthenshire” and clear evidence that there was strong opposition to commercial dog breeding and concerns about the welfare of the animals. g. While it was difficult to determine whether the release of the information would result in an increase in activity by animal welfare extremists, there was sufficient evidence that disclosure could lead to increased activity and that it could cause unnecessary and unjustified distress and damage the individuals. h. There was great public concern about the standards of welfare of dog breeders and, specifically in Wales, there had been evidence of poor welfare in some breeding establishments resulting in new welfare regulations concerning dog breeding. i. While licensing was designed to ensure certain minimum standards, there was a concern that some public authorities might not be undertaking their responsibilities properly. Disclosure of the requested information would provide opportunities for public scrutiny. j. Other public authorities had either published or had disclosed the names and addresses of licensed dog breeders in their area. k. Both the Commissioner and the Council accepted there was a clear public interest in knowing that dog breeding was properly regulated. There was also a very strong public interest in ensuring that animals were treated and cared for properly. l. The Commissioner believed the case was finally balanced but held that the potential damage and distress that would be caused by the disclosure outweighed the legitimate interest of the public. Although the Commissioner’s Decision Notice does not explicitly make the finding in its conclusion, it is to be inferred from the analysis that the Commissioner considered that public disclosure of the requested information would not amount to fair processing and would therefore be in -5-breach of the first data protection principle in Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998. The Second Respondent’s Response 10. The Council, in its response, adopted the Commissioner’s arguments. It believed that the absence of any recorded criminal convictions should not be taken as proof of the absence of criminal or other harmful actions by animal welfare activists. 11. Its response had been based on advice previously received from the police. Its position was strengthened by the response from licensed dog breeders to the survey it had conducted. The licensed dog breeders were fearful that, if the requested information was disclosed, they would be targeted by activists opposed to commercial dog breeding. 12. The Council believed that the high proportion of dog breeders in Carmarthenshire was a sign of the success of its policy in ensuring that local breeders were licensed and regulated. If the requested information was disclosed to the public at large – including those strongly opposed to commercial dog breeding – it would place licensed dog breeders at risk of harm and discourage them from engaging in the licensing process. 13. It was concerned that there was a significant risk that disclosure of the requested information would result in dog breeders choosing to trade illegally, making the monitoring of the welfare of breeding dogs infinitely more difficult. The appeal to the Tribunal 14. The Appellant set out her position in her grounds of appeal dated 9 November 2012 and in a detailed and closely-argued reply to the Information Commissioner’s points dated 31 December 2012. In summary: a. The Council had made a number of claims about prejudice to licensed dog breeders which had no evidential basis. b. The Appellant noted that while the Council had made a number of claims that actual harm such as criminal damage and threatening behaviour had occurred to licensed breeders as a result of “animal -6-welfare extremist” activity, those claims had not been substantiated. There was no evidence of any causal relationship between disclosure of the information and the existence of those harms. c. The Council had presented evidence that certain licensed breeders had concerns about potential harm to them if the details were to be disclosed. That was based on the responses of a sample of licensed dog breeders to a communication from the Council to all licensed breeders asking about their views on disclosure. 60% of the breeders who were approached replied to this enquiry and 93% did not want the details disclosed. Some cited fears of the consequences. There was, however, no evidence presented by the Council that disclosure of the information would take matters beyond individual breeders worrying to a degree that affected mental health or that the effects of such worrying were likely to be sustained or enduring. d. The Appellant summarised issues in relation to welfare problems with dog breeding and legitimate public interests in disclosure of licensed dog breeders’ details. In essence, disclosure of the details of licensed breeders by the Council would be consistent with the purposes of dog breeding regulations to assure a certain minimum welfare standard to meet public expectations, to assist purchasers of puppies where the current marketing environment provided opportunities for puppies to be sold with no information on provenance, to assist enforcement particularly in terms of public reporting to authorities who might not have the resources to seek out and investigate unlicensed breeders, to enable scrutiny of licensing standards being applied by the Council and facilitating redress by purchasers of puppies where later health problems arose. e. In relation to the Council’s “policy” – introduced in 2008 – there was no record available of any discussions within the Council about how the policy was arrived at. f. Mention had been made of the police informing the Council that there had been incidents of targeting properties of dog breeders resulting in criminal damage and threats to public safety. The Appellant had made enquiries which showed that, for the two-year period to which the request related, Dyfed-Powys Police held no records of any such discussions with the Council. There were no recorded convictions relating to violence, criminal damage or threatening behaviour occasioned to dog breeders that could be connected with “animal welfare extremists” in the last five years. There appeared to be no convictions from such activity in relation to Carmarthenshire. g. The Council had used inappropriately emotive descriptions to justify its position of non-disclosure by describing “animal welfare extremists” “targeting” the authority and “converging on it from all parts of the country” without giving any evidence to support those statements. h. The Appellant had provided the Commissioner with lists of licensed breeders which were provided - without hesitation - to her by a number of other local authorities in Wales. These had been provided without -7-any mention of reports of harm caused to licensed dog breeders due to the release of this information. The information included a full list of the 71 licensed breeders in Ceredigion County Council, a county directly adjacent to Carmarthenshire and – along with Carmarthenshire – the location of the highest concentration of both licensed and unlicensed dog breeders in Wales. i. The purpose of the dog breeding regulations that required licensing was to address public concerns about welfare standards in this sector. The information requested related to the adherence of such business to publicly expected and legally required minimum standards. j. Arguments supporting non-disclosure on the grounds of unfairness – as a result of intrusion into personal privacy – were weakened because of this professional business aspect at the root of the data requested. Evidence 15. In addition to the open information disclosed to the Appellant in this appeal, the Tribunal considered closed information supplied by the Council. 16. In arriving at its decision, the Tribunal feels no need to refer to the detail of the closed information either in this decision or in any closed annexe to it. Conclusion and remedy 17. The Tribunal reminds itself of the relevant legislation in respect of this request. Section 40 FOIA is a “gateway” provision in respect of issues relating to personal data as follows: 40 — Personal information … (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— -8-(i) any of the data protection principles, … The first data protection principle is set out in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the DPA: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met. The relevant Schedule 2 condition is the sixth which provides, so far as relevant: (1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 18. ‘Necessary’ has been defined as meaning that there is a ‘pressing social need’ and that interference with a data subject’s rights is “proportionate as to means and finely balanced as to ends”: Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner [2011] 1 Info LR 987 at [43]. 19. The importance of the protection of an individual’s right to privacy in respect of their personal data is summarised by Lord Hope in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] 1 WLR 1550, referring to the parent directive and the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 at [7]: In my opinion there is no presumption in favour of the release of personal data under the general obligation that the 2002 Act lays down. The references which that Act makes to provisions of the 1998 Act must be understood in the light of the legislative purpose of that Act, which was to implement Council Directive 95/46/EC . The guiding principle is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data: see recital 2 of the preamble to, and article 1(1) of, the Directive… 20. In Morley v Information Commissioner & Surrey Heath Borough Council [2012] 2 Info LR 155, the Tribunal observed at [17] & [22]: ….there is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom of information on the one hand, and the protection of personal data on -9-the other. Section 40(2) seeks to ensure that the interests of those requesting information from a public authority do not undermine, unnecessarily, the interest of those individuals whose personal data might find its way into the public domain as a result of the public authority complying with such a request. When section 40(2) is engaged, the Tribunal is required to undertake quite a different task from when it deals with other FOIA exemptions. FOIA promotes the right to information, but when section 40(2) is under consideration, the DPA determines the proper approach, and the interest of data subjects receives a high degree of protection. … 21. Bearing all of the above in mind the Tribunal believes – on the facts of this case - that an important factor for any assessment in relation to the “fairness” of the disclosure of the personal data is best discovered from the context in which the personal data was provided to the Council in the first place. 22. The context, here, is to secure a commercial licence required by law to breed dogs. That license is necessary for the local authority to know who the licensed dog breeders in that area are, and so that the law can be enforced and welfare checks can be conducted as and when necessary in relation to the welfare of the dogs being bred commercially. 23. Licensing - in the ordinary course of things - is a public regulatory process. Indeed it was a public process in Carmarthenshire, in relation to the information that is at the core of this appeal, until the Council changed its policy in 2008. 24. The Tribunal is unimpressed with the Council’s survey of those currently on the licensed dog breeders’ register – conducted after the information was requested – that seeks to justify the policy of non-disclosure. The survey, and the suggestive language used in posing the questions, inevitably gives the impression of being self-serving and less than objective. 25. The survey would have had greater evidential value for the Tribunal to consider if it had been conducted as an objective attitude and information- gathering exercise prior to the Council considering its policy in this area in 2008. The Council could then have argued with greater force that individuals had come on to the Register because they had an expectation – in data - 10 -protection terms – that only the Council would be aware of their identities and home addresses. 26. An adjacent County Council, Ceredigion, revealed similar information. The fact that there were 71 licensed dog breeders on the register disclosed by that Council does not support this Council’s argument that disclosure of information about breeders would cause breeders to operate their dog breeding in an unlicensed and illegal fashion for fear of disclosure of their identities. 27. The Tribunal accepts that the interplay of private and public interest issues in relation to disclosure of this information is complex but has concluded, unanimously, that in this case it is fair and in the public interest - in regulated commercial activity which is subject to a public licensing regime to protect the welfare of animals – to subordinate the privacy interests of those who register to engage in such activity so as to permit the personal data to be disclosed. 28. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 24 April 2013 - 11 -"

Action Required Within 31 days of service of this notice on the Respondents, The National Archives is to release the information detailed in the Schedule to this substituted Decision Notice to the Appellant. Dated 15 February 2013 Robin Callender Smith Judge -3-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. On 6 March 1952 a 42-year-old Cardiff shopkeeper, Lily Volpert, was found dead with her throat cut. Mr Mahmood Hussein Mattan, a member of the Somali community in Cardiff, was tried for her murder – a capital offence at the time - and convicted in July 1952. 2. In August 1952 he was refused leave to appeal and to call further evidence. In September 1952 he was hanged. 3. In 1969 further evidence came to light in respect of the Mattan case. One of the prosecution witnesses in that original trial – Mr Harold Cover – was himself subsequently tried and convicted for the attempted murder of his own daughter. 4. At that stage unsuccessful attempts were made to reopen the Mattan case but it was not until 1997 that it was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. In 1998 his conviction was quashed and he received a posthumous pardon 46 years after his execution. 5. Mr Mattan’s file was transferred to the Second Respondent in this appeal (The National Archives), and the Appellant (Dr Christopher Phillips) – on 25 June 2011 – asked for access to it. In respect of Document reference DPP 2/2145 he stated: The file relates to the case of Mahmood Mattan, who was convicted of murder in 1952 and executed following the refusal of leave to appeal. His conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1998. I should like to consult the whole file if possible. If the whole file cannot be made available I should like to consult such parts as can be made available. 6. The National Archives consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on section 66 FOIA in respect of whether or not the file constituted exempt information and also in respect of the application of -4-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 the public interest test. On 25 July 2011 Dr Phillips was informed by The National Archives that he could not inspect the file because it contained exempt information in respect of section 40 FOIA. He was also informed that section 38 FOIA applied and that a decision on the public interest test would be made. 7. On 6 September 2011 the CPS asked for advice from a panel of the Lord Chancellor’s Advisory Council of National Records and Archives about the application of section 38. 8. On 12 September 2011 that Council advised that the public interest came down in favour of not disclosing the file. Dr Phillips asked for a review and he was informed on 18 November 2011 that, following a review and further consultation with the CPS, parts of the file were going to be released. This material included general correspondence, newspaper cuttings, maps and plans. The remainder of the file was to remain closed. The Information Commissioner’s Decision 9. The Information Commissioner, in a decision notice dated 11 June 2012, upheld The National Archives’ review decision. The National Archives had allowed access to a significant portion of the file in April 2012 but the general public – including the Appellant – was unable to order or view the withheld information at the heart of this appeal. 10. The withheld information was: (a) Witness statements; (b) Crime scene and area photos; (c) Post-mortem report; (d) Medical report about Mr Mattan; (e) Police reports; (f) Court administration papers; and (g) Other miscellaneous documents. -5-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 11. The Commissioner found – in relation to the two exemptions claimed by The National Archives – that: (a) It would be unfair to disclose the witness statements and that section 40 (2) was engaged; (b) It would be likely to endanger the physical or mental health of the victim’s family to disclose the crime scene and area photos, the post-mortem report, the court administration papers and miscellaneous documents. The public interest test favoured maintaining section 38 FOIA in relation to these documents. (c) It would be likely to endanger the physical or mental health of Mr Mattan’s family to disclose the medical report about him; the public interest test favoured maintaining section 38 and section 41 was likely to have been engaged. (d) Sections 38 and 40 (2) applied to the police reports. 12. In terms of the Witness Statements, the Commissioner noted (Paragraph 24 DN) that The National Archives had provided some explanation about how the disclosure of this information would cause unnecessary damage or distress to the individuals. Given that Mr Mattan had received a posthumous pardon for the murder, to release statements made by other individuals which may have had some bearing on his original conviction would lead to the individual concerned potentially suffering criticism and reputational damage. In relation to the reasonable expectation of the witnesses, the Commissioner considered that they would have had no reasonable expectation that this information would be placed in the public domain. Witnesses, when providing information as part of an investigation, do so with the expectation that their information will not then be published. Given the nature of the material and the sensitivity of the subject matter, disclosure could lead to an intrusion into the private lives of the individuals concerned. -6-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 13. In relation to the Crime Scene and Area Photos and Maps the Commissioner had previously accepted that an individual’s mental well- being would fall within the scope of section 38. Having looked at the photographs to which the section had been applied, the Commissioner considered that the consequences of the disclosure of the information into the public domain – especially if there was a likelihood of it being reported in the media – would cause significant distress to the families of the victim. It was graphic in nature. Even with the passage of time there was still a duty of care to the family and to some of the people involved in the investigation. Disclosure after the length of time that had passed would have the same effect as putting the information into the public domain for the first time. 14. In terms of the Post-Mortem Report the same reasoning was applied. 15. In relation to the Medical Report about Mahmood Mattan the Commissioner had previously considered the issue in relation to access to medical records of deceased people and had established that the information contained within such records would be exempt as it was information provided in confidence (a view supported by the Information Rights Tribunal: Bluck EA/2006/0090). 16. The Police Reports contained varying degrees of information. There were graphic descriptions of the crime considered under section 38 and matters in relation to descriptions of witnesses and suspects under section 40 (2). Information relating to the graphic nature of the crime would be likely to endanger the mental health of the family of the victim. It would not be fair to disclose the information relating to witnesses in the police reports. 17. The Court Administration Papers were held as part of the criminal case file. Because of the graphic nature of some of the information the National Archives’ cautious approach in respect of FOIA sections 38 and 40 (2) was appropriate given the nature of the information and the -7-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 graphic descriptions and amount of personal data contained within the papers. 18. The reasons relating to the Miscellaneous Documents that had been withheld were set out in a confidential annex. The appeal to the Tribunal 19. Some of the original issues in Dr Phillips’s detailed grounds of appeal dated 4 July 2012 were refined and accommodated before the oral hearing. In particular he indicated that he was not seeking access to the crime scene photographs or the mortuary photograph, the depositions in the Magistrates’ Court or to the trial transcript as he had for copies of those from other sources. [The reason is that the Criminal Cases Review Commission released this material to him on request.] 20. He disputed the withholding of the material under section 38 in the remainder of the file and specifically in relation to [* = subsequently released before the appeal hearing]: (a) the witness statements of DS Dalton*, Dr A H Mitchell, Dr WRL James (post-mortem), PS Walsh* (part), PC J Davies (part), DCI H Power* (part) and Mr EG Davies* (part) (b) the report by DCI Power dated 26 March 1952 (about 20 lines) (c) advice on evidence* (one page withheld) (d) appeal Court judgement, 19 August 1952 (two lines withheld) (e) handwritten notes on the evidence [by RLD Thomas] (about a page and a half withheld). 21. Dr Phillips had also indicated that he was prepared to accept more limited information in respect of issues to which section 40 had been applied. He had stated he was seeking only: -8-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 …. The non-sensitive personal data that would assist me in determining which of the people concerned are still living. I understand that in some circumstances this cannot be provided simply by redacting the sensitive data as what remained might provide clues to what had been removed. What I am therefore asking for is a list of the names of those for whom personal data have been removed, together with their addresses, ages, occupations and names of spouses, where given. 22. As a result of the key CPS witness (Mr Andrew Penhale, the Deputy Head of the Central Fraud Group who is also the CPS Freedom of Information Champion) reconsidering matters in relation to the public interest and making a written witness statement signed 31 October 2012, the Treasury Solicitor wrote to Dr Phillips on 1 November 2012. 23. Mr Penhale’s key evidence, set out in that witness statement, stated (at Paragraphs 18 and 19): There is a very significant public interest in favour of disclosure in this case. The case involved a miscarriage of justice and a man being hanged following his wrongful conviction. It appears from the papers that significant evidence was not considered during the trial and this may have substantially altered the case outcome. The conduct of the investigation and prosecution should, as a result, be subject to public scrutiny. It is important, therefore, that the case material is considered carefully before any material is withheld. This has indeed happened and the TNA have carefully redacted and removed only those items where they consider the exemptions under section 38 or section 40 are engaged . In particular, they have removed sensitive personal information (relating for instance to the sexual history of Mr Matten and his wife) and items likely to cause distress to the family of the victim (such as photographs of the body and scene, pathology reports and any references to the presence of blood at the scene as reported by police witnesses). Whilst I agree with the principles applied to the withholding of the material which may cause distress to the family, I am not sure that I agree with all the redactions and removals. Photographs of the deceased and the bloody scene and pathology report are exactly the sort of material which may cause significant distress and upset to the family, by reminding them of the terrible murder which had taken place. On the other hand, statements of the police officers, which simply describe the bloodstains found at the scene are far less likely to do so; and, in this case, are relatively innocuous. In my view, there is a very strong public interest in revealing this latter material. The nature of -9-Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 the crime makes it likely that there was a very significant distribution of blood at the scene, including on the perpetrator’s clothing. This should have given rise to an important line of investigation, even within the limited forensic science available in 1952, surrounding blood recovered from the clothing at Mr Matten’s home. There is therefore a legitimate interest in the description of blood at the scene which is likely to override concerns about upsetting the family. 24. Despite The National Archives’ slight relaxation of its original position Dr Phillips indicated he wished to continue the appeal in relation to section 38 – and documents that had not been released under that category – and that he also wished to pursue his appeal in relation to section 40 (the provision by the National Archives’ to him of a list of biographical details of the data subjects). 25. The submissions made by The National Archives in relation to qualified exemption relating to section 38 at the oral appeal was that the information – if disclosed – would or would be likely to endanger the physical or mental health of any individual. There had to be a real and significant risk of endangerment as opposed to a fanciful or remote or hypothetical risk. “Mere” stress or worry would be insufficient. The withheld items contain graphic descriptions of the injuries inflicted on the victim such as to pose a real and significant risk of significant upset or distress being caused to the surviving family members of the victim, particularly her niece. 26. The National Archives accepted that there was a public interest in the underlying capital criminal proceedings. That strong interest had to be balanced against a real and significant risk of significant upset and distress. Although The National Archives had adjusted its position in relation to the importance attached to the distribution of blood at the scene of the crime, because of the reasoning set out in Mr Penhale’s witness statement, the graphic descriptions of the physical injuries suffered added little to the public understanding of the Mattan case, especially given the wealth of information in the public domain. The - 10 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 public knew enough about the nature of the injuries to permit public debate about the case. 27. The potential damage that might be done to the public’s ability to discuss and debate the Mattan case by withholding graphic descriptions of the injuries inflicted was outweighed by the real and significant likelihood of significant distress and upset that might be caused to surviving family members. 28. In relation to section 40 the National Archives had reasonably applied a “100 years-of-age” Rule and needed to act cautiously. Disclosure of a list of biographical information would breach the first data protection principle that required all personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully. Fairness required balancing of interests it involved balancing the legitimate public interest in the Mattan case itself with the right to privacy of those who were involved with the Mattan criminal proceedings. 29. Participants in criminal proceedings might expect to give evidence in public and might also expect that some of their private information might be aired at the public trial or hearing. Mere revelation of private information at a public hearing could not be equated with the effect of release of the same information under FOIA. In a criminal court setting the release of private information was judicially controlled, unrecorded by the public and haphazardly reported by the media. It was only usually disclosed to those who were physically present in the courtroom. The public could not obtain access to the information after the hearing was over and, as such, it was right that the information remain private and protectable under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the “gateway” provision into that statute by virtue of section 40 FOIA. 30. It would significantly undermine the criminal justice system if prosecutors such as the CPS could not protect personal data merely because the data subject was involved in a criminal case in which there was a public interest – no matter how historic – especially where - 11 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 sensitive personal data was involved. The CPS’ Mr Penhale had emphasised, in his witness statement, the vital public interest consideration that victims and witnesses of serious crime should be protected from unfettered release of case information into the public domain. Evidence 31. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from two witnesses who were able to give their core evidence in the open session. The first witness was Ms Helen Potter. She is one of the Freedom of Information Managers in The National Archives. She is responsible for overseeing FOI activity throughout The National Archives, managing internal appeals and responding to complaints made to the Information Commissioners Office. She had become involved in the Appellant’s request at the point where he sought an internal review of the decision of 12 September 2011. 32. She set out the process of this involved and the guidance which she had used to assist her in making decisions. When the matter was first allocated to her, initially she had looked at whether or not the procedural aspects of the handling of the Appellant’s request had been carried out correctly. She had then proceeded to read all of the documentation in the case file including The National Archives’ research report to the CPS and subsequent correspondence in order to understand fully how the original decision was reached on whether the recommendations made were accurate and justifiable in relation to the information requested. She then reviewed file DPP 2/2145 to see whether the conclusions reached about withholding the file in its entirety was one that was supportable. 33. In respect of section 38 – having reviewed the file and undertaken some initial research on the Internet to understand the background to the file – she formed the view that the was a great deal of information contained in DPP 2/2145 that was already in the public domain and - 12 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 which recounted the basic facts of the case. She took the view that the surviving relatives of the victim will likely to have a basic knowledge and understanding of what happened to the victim whether or not they had been present at Mr Mattan's trial. Court papers outlining the charge, maps, plans and statements which included details of the events prior to and directly after the murder (which did not describe the attack itself) did not – in her view – provide details which, if seen, would cause undue and “significant damage and distress” to those surviving family members. 34. She had referred to a decision of the Commissioner in April 2009 – Ministry of Justice v Information Commissioner [FS50121803] – where the Commissioner had stated that he considered an individual’s mental well-being to fall within the scope of the section. In this he includes emotional and psychological well-being including the likelihood of causing significant upset or distress. 35. She considered that documents which illustrated the extent of the violence suffered by the victim amounted to information that was likely to have a significant impact upon the surviving family members. This information included material about the state in which the victim/murder scene was found, any post-mortem reports and analysis and the collection of forensic evidence from the body. Information provided by those who are acting in an official capacity and who had responsibilities for handling the body, attending the crime scene and collecting forensic evidence – while clinical and objective – could often be interpreted as cold. Because that information could be disturbing and could cause substantial distress to the victim’s surviving relatives, she considered that detail to be sensitive. 36. She had considered whether the release of that specific information was likely to harm or prejudice the mental health of any of the victim’s surviving relatives. Although the content of murder file cases, particularly those in the “DPP 2” series, could often be similar in respect of the types of document they contained, the actual level of - 13 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 graphic detail could differ quite widely. Understanding the circumstances of the case under review was important because it was not just graphic details regarding the death of the victim that could cause mental distress. It could also be any tragic set of events that led to the murder including details of domestic abuse, extramarital affairs or details of how a child might have been lured or snatched. 37. It was clear from the review of the file that the victim’s young niece had been present in the adjoining room when the victim was murdered and, as a result, the event itself would be a deep-rooted personal experience as it had occurred during her childhood within her home environment. While she would have been clearly aware of the manner in which her aunt was murdered she would not necessarily have been present at the trial of Mr Mattan and might not be aware of the graphic details of the murder itself. 38. Mr Mattan had been hanged and it was possible that some of the information contained in the file could be distressing to his surviving family members. That could include information in relation to any mental health assessments or his state of mind prior to his execution. 39. Ms Potter arrived at the conclusion that, although the release of certain information contained in the file might cause significant distress to those surviving family members – either of the victim or Mr Mattan – not all of the documents in the file contained distressing information. She concluded that redaction could be used to ensure that such information was not disclosed to the detriment of those relatives. 40. In terms of the sensitivity of the information, she recognised the importance of Mr Mattan’s case to the legal history of the United Kingdom. He had been one of the last persons to be hanged in the United Kingdom and, subsequently pardoned. Those specific circumstances meant that the case was one of very significant public interest. In her view, the public interest in the case related predominantly to the information that would provide greater knowledge - 14 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 and clarity in relation to the investigation and prosecution of Mr Mattan and not to the information about the details of the murder itself. She had given more weight to the disclosure of information falling into the former category. She had recommended release of as much information that would inform the public about Mr Mattan’s prosecution – such as court papers, parts of the court transcript and the police report – but had redacted information that related to the details of the murder itself. 41. She had also considered the amount of information that was already in the public domain. She had been guided by The National Archives’ guidance paper entitled Information in the public domain and access to historical records at The National Archives. The guidance made it clear that, even in circumstances where information may be in the public domain, that did not necessarily mean that the official record should be released by The National Archives. The reason was that it was difficult to establish, in relation to historical files relating to criminal cases, what information was released into the public domain at the time of the criminal proceedings. The guidance stated that in the criminal field there are several websites and books that specialise on the detail of crimes and the motives of those involved: this does not warrant the release of all the circumstances of the crime including those details that may damage the mental health of a victim’s immediate family (scene of crime photographs) or details of victims who did not press charges. 42. She had come to the conclusion that documents which contained factual details relating to the case – rather than details of the actual murder/murder scene – could be released while documents containing details of the murder could be released in redacted form. 43. In terms of section 40 (personal data), in the absence of date of birth information for many of the data subjects mentioned in the file she applied the 100-year rule and assumed the data subjects to be alive. In the context of the totality of the file she considered that certain information had to be withheld in order to ensure that The National - 15 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 Archives did not breach the first data protection principle requiring the personal data be processed in a fair and lawful manner. She was particularly concerned with whether the release of certain data would be unfair. 44. She considered that the data in question that might need to be withheld fell into two categories: personal data including that pertaining to juveniles (i.e. those who were juveniles at the time of the case) and sensitive personal data which included medical data of a witness, unsubstantiated allegations and information relating to the sexual lives of witnesses. 45. Although the identities of witnesses who provided evidence in the court proceedings could be released, the content of the witness statements and other documentation that contained evidence from witnesses (particularly police reports) required further attention because some of the information contained was personal data or sensitive personal data of the individuals or other third parties. Her actual redactions had been limited to those categories of personal data. 46. She had borne in mind that although, at the time, witnesses had provided evidence for the purposes of criminal proceedings – and they may have had an expectation that their identities would become known – it did not necessarily follow that they would have expected their personal and/or sensitive personal data would be disseminated more widely under FOIA. 47. She had also considered that the general public interest in Mr Mattan’s case predominantly related to the fact that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Releasing information now – that was personal and sensitive personal data of a witness – added very little to the public’s interest in the matter. The National Archives also had to ensure that the release of such information about individuals who were still living and identifiable did not cause some substantial damage or distress. - 16 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 48. The Tribunal also heard oral evidence from Mr Stuart Abraham. He had worked at The National Archives since 1993 and was the Freedom of Information Centre Manager. 49. He explained that within the series DPP 2, of the 6300 files currently in the series 2624 of them – 42% – were closed files. The CPS transferred the majority of its files on a closed basis to protect surviving relatives. Allowing files to be open to the public could have very serious adverse impact on the lives of relatives and files might also identify juvenile defendants and victims of sexual crimes. 50. Prior to the introduction of FOIA the policy on disclosure of files relating to murder and other serious violent crimes was summarised in The National Archives’ Access to public records manual (Appendix 3) which stated information relating to the victims of murder may be closed for the lifetime of their parents, siblings, spouse or children. This is most likely to be justified where the offence was committed within the family or had a personal element. Substantial distress is less likely to be caused by release of information obtained during the investigation of murder committed in the course of robbery or manslaughter or by motor car. Types of information likely to be severely distressing to the family [included] film or photographs of the deceased taken at the scene of the crime and photographs taken during post-mortem investigations; graphic descriptions of what was done to the victim included in witness statements or post- mortem report; negative comments on the victim’s character, family or domestic circumstances; evidence of the legitimacy or inheritable illness of the victim and their immediate family. 51. He noted that on 6 September 2011 the CPS had produced a submission to a panel of the Lord Chancellor’s Advisory Council on National Records and Archives regarding the nondisclosure of the information requested by the Appellant. The Advisory Council endorsed the CPS’ recommendation for nondisclosure on the basis that “the danger to the mental health of the surviving child outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The file should therefore remain closed”. - 17 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 52. For the benefit of the Appellant – who was not permitted to be present during the closed examination of those two oral witnesses – the Tribunal heard further argument in respect of why certain matters should remain redacted so that it could better understand how TNA had arrived at its decisions to make the remaining redactions. This closed session lasted little more than 20 minutes. Appellant’s Legal submissions 53. Dr Phillips argued that, in relation to section 38, the exemption was not engaged. He stated that, if it was considered to be engaged on the basis that there was a likelihood of danger to someone’s mental health, then he would not wish to argue for disclosure on public interest grounds. His main point was that members of the victim’s family were very unlikely to be unwillingly exposed to the information in question and that the likelihood of any danger to mental health itself was remote. In previous arguments before the Tribunal the required level of likelihood had been found to be “a very significant and weighty chance” and he did not believe that particular threshold had been crossed in this case. 54. His position was that the substance of the medical evidence about the injuries to the victims was already in the public domain in the form of the testimony of Dr James and Dr Mitchell (at the trial) because the trial transcript was available from the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). He had obtained a copy of the transcript in 2012 after a simple request (not an FOIA request) and the CCRC had placed no conditions on his use of it and had apparently checked that there were no bars in respect of that in relation to disclosure. 55. Another version of the medical evidence – in the form of depositions given at the Magistrates’ Court – had been freely available at The National Archives from 1996 until 2012 in the Assize file. - 18 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 56. In relation to arguments that the disputed information was likely to come to the attention of the victim’s family there was no substantial or objective evidence that there was a “real and significant chance” of that happening. 57. He believed that for section 38 to be engaged it was necessary further to be more than a simple risk of upset and distress in a manner that had been suggested that would result from the disclosure of the information. The National Archives had used a “substantial distress” test and the stronger language used by the CPS in its submission to the Lord Chancellors Advisory Council was based on The National Archives’ report in relation to the case being “particularly upsetting” and that some of the material was likely to be “very distressing”. He believed that FOIA had moved things beyond those more general categorisations with the enactment of section 38 requiring a clear likelihood of endangerment of mental health, a stronger requirement. 58. Both in his written submission and final submission he had referred to a consultation paper and a Report of the Law Commission (published in 1992 and 1993 respectively) in which the meaning of “impairment of mental health” was discussed. The Report stated that the impairment of mental health required the court to consider probably with the benefit of medical advice whether the condition has passed beyond the line that divides anxiety or distress from damage to health. 59. In relation to the section 40 matters what he was seeking was a list of names and non-sensitive data that would be sufficient to identify people unambiguously in respect of addresses, occupations, ages and names of spouses. With that information he would be able to seek proof of death such that he could then ask TNA to release information on the basis that section 40 only applied to living individuals. In view of the age of the records he believed it was likely that many of the people concerned were no longer living. He was only asking for a factual list, not for any indication about which redaction related to which individual. - 19 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 Conclusion and remedy 60. The Tribunal – at the outset – is grateful for the time and effort applied to this appeal by both The National Archives (and their witnesses) and the carefully focused submissions of the Appellant. The Tribunal reflects that when this file originally arrived at The National Archives it was completely closed. 61. As a result of the Appellant’s persistence and the careful consideration given to the issues raised by him by Ms Potter as she reviewed the situation more than 75% of the file is already now open to the public. 62. Having had the opportunity of hearing Ms Potter’s open and closed oral evidence, and bearing in mind that Ms Potter was cross-examined by the Appellant and asked further questions by the Tribunal, her careful thought and consideration to the job that she does day in and day out for The National Archives is a credit to both her and her employer. She is not someone who simply applies a black felt tip pen to make uncritical, rule-based redactions. Rather she is someone who thinks conscientiously and carefully about the implications of every single piece of information she has to deal with and makes decisions in a thoughtful and reasonable way. 63. That said, this is an unusual and important case. It is an example of a major miscarriage of justice that led to the execution of an innocent man. There can be no greater tragedy than that. 64. A further unusual feature of this appeal is that the CCRC have released to the Appellant a copy of the trial transcript without bar or condition on its use. In short, there has been available to the Appellant – and to any other member of the public who chooses to make a similar application – a significant quantity of the withheld information provided by another public authority. 65. In terms of the section 38 exemption the Tribunal has examined carefully whether it is engaged and, if it is, the balancing factors that - 20 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 then arise in terms of public interest. The core argument that has been advanced by the Information Commissioner and The National Archives is that the remaining material “would be likely to endanger…. mental health” - that the potential of exposing certain individuals – notably family members of the victim – to more graphic descriptions of the murder and the handling of the body could be deeply upsetting and could cause them to relive this event that occurred 60 years ago. 66. The Tribunal has been provided with no objective medical evidence that this would be the case and it could be invaluable in its place, providing it is proportionate. The facts within this case mean that there was a series of repeated high profile publications - in terms of the reporting of the court proceedings, newspaper investigations and indeed a book written by a former policeman with access to contemporaneous police records – and revelations of detailed information (in the form of the trial transcript) to the Appellant by the body that ultimately recommended that the conviction against Mr Mattan should be re-examined in the Court of Appeal which overturned the conviction . 67. Arguments that, separately or cumulatively, such publications may not necessarily have alerted those whose mental health may be endangered to the detail of the case do not seem to be arguments that stand up to the test of reality and proportionality because of the repeated occasions on which the information at issue in relation to the case surfaced at the trials of Mattan, and then of Cover, and in the local and national press. 68. In short, the Tribunal is not satisfied that section 38 is engaged in this appeal. For that reason it would remove the redactions applied under that section. All of the material contained within the redactions is available within the trial transcript already disclosed to the Appellant. 69. Conversely, the attempt by the Appellant to have matters currently redacted under section 40 FOIA – in terms of the personal and - 21 -Appeal No. EA/2012/0141 sensitive personal data of individuals – disclosed to him in the form of lists of names and dates of birth (however non-specific) is doomed to fail. 70. As was demonstrated to us through a number of examples in the closed session, this would permit “jigsaw” identification of personal and sensitive personal data that would be unfair processing under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. It would permit the Appellant to build up a matrix of information which he could then use to narrow down specific individuals in breach of the data protection principles. 71. Our decision is unanimous. 72. There is no order as to costs.

"234","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2012/0133 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50425834 Dated: 28 May 2012 Appellant: Ian Pratt Respondent: The Information Commissioner Heard at: Central London Civil Justice Centre Date of hearing: 8 October 2012 Date of decision: 4 January 2013 Before CHRIS RYAN (Judge) and ALISON LOWTON NIGEL WATSON Attendances: The Appellant in person: the Respondent did not appear and was not represented. Subject matter: Whether information held s.1: Vexatious or repeated requests s.14IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2012/0133 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed in part but, in the light of the parts of the appeal that did not succeed, no steps are required to be taken by the Public Authority. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. We have decided, unanimously, that the Blagdon Parish Council (“The Council”) did not hold certain information regarding its financial budgeting and recording, which the Appellant had requested, but that his request for that information had not been vexatious. We have decided, by a majority, that two further requests were vexatious. Background information and Requests for Information 2. This appeal results from a series of disagreements between the Appellant and the Council which started with a dispute over the right to access and tend an area of land. The area of dispute widened as the correspondence (at times balanced and at others intemperate) developed. One of the Appellant’s letters was interpreted by the clerk to the Council (“the Clerk”) as a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). Other requests followed, sometimes expressly referring to FOIA and at others interpreted by the Council as falling within its scope. 3. We are not concerned with any of these requests, or the arguments that lay behind them, save to the extent that the overall context has a bearing on the Council’s contention that the request that we are concerned with should be treated as vexatious. However, by June 2010 the issues in dispute had come to include various financial matters including: a. the recording by the Council of its income and expenditure which, it was said by the Clerk, in a letter dated 15 June 2010, were “recorded on relevant agendas and minutes”; b. the Appellant’s wish to examine, or be provided with copies of, annual returns and auditor’s reports for certain years; and c. the adequacy of the short form financial statements which, the Clerk explained, was all a small council was required to record.4. The Appellant was provided with a certain amount of information at the time. Then, following the end of the financial year to 31 March 2011, the Appellant asked for a copy of the Council’s Annual Return for that year. This was provided to him and on 1 July 2011 he wrote to the Clerk thanking him and continuing in the following terms: “Unfortunately whilst this contains a series of accounting balances and totals it does not constitute a set of accounts which is what I requested in my email of 24 June 2011. Please now supply me with the detailed Income and Expenditure statement or similar document which I presume as a quality parish council you must be producing. If no such statement is produced please let me know. “If there is no such statement please provide me with lead schedules showing the make up of every figure on the annual return. I would also like to be provided with copies of the detailed budget for the year ended 31st March 2011 together with your analysis of any key variances between the budget and the actual figures for that year. Please also supply me with the budget for the year ending 31st March 2012” 5. This was treated as a request for information under section 1 of FOIA and we will refer to this as the “First Information Request”. 6. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. 7. On 31 July 2011 the Council responded to the request providing, the opening and closing bank balances and an asset list. It stated that all information relating to income and expenditure was recorded in the minutes of Council meetings and was also already available to the Appellant except that: “The Commissioner’s office (FOI) confirms the clerks net salary is an exempt item (personal) as is any information that would permit its calculation.” As to the budget for the year ended 31 March 2011 the Council stated: “The Council uses the receipts and payments details for the relevant 12 months and these are available on the publicisedagendas and minutes. The Council add to this any planned expenditure for the coming year with each decision minuted.” 8. The Council provided the Appellant with a copy of a note on the Council’s calculation of the precept it believed it required for the year in question, which included some indications of various items of expected expenditure. However, it declined to respond to the request for information on key variances, as requested, because, it said: “…this is an information exchange between accountants and Councils and not for publication.” 9. Finally, the Council explained that it did not yet have information on its budget for the year ending 31 March 2012, stating that: “The first figures will be prepared for the 2012-13 precept discussions later this year. The receipts and payments system allows for a monthly check on the bank balances and agendas and minutes provide details.” 10. The Council’s response had included an introductory section which indicated that, in the event of the Appellant seeking further information, it might be entitled to aggregate the cost of responding to both the First Information Request and any follow up and that, if the total figure exceeded £450, the Appellant would be required to pay the costs of the subsequent application before information could be provided. It then said: “Costs are (sic) currently total £254.44 and it is based on work done rather than an estimate. Section 9 of the FOI act applies.” Under FOIA section 12 a public authority may refuse an information request if it estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed a maximum fixed under subordinate legislation. 11. On 10 August 2011 the Appellant responded. He complained, first, that the Council had previously decided not to charge for complying with information requests but, referring to the figure quoted in the introduction the Council’s letter, wrote: “They [the costs quoted] are however very interesting as they indicate the speed at which you work and thus the value for money you provide to our village. Given that all the information you supplied to me would have been in your possession I find it thoroughly revealing to discover that it appears to have taken you in the order of 9 to 10 hours to prepare. “Please provide a breakdown of your time to provide the answers to each numbered point on your reply.“Turning to other matters please let me know the clerks gross salary. The net salary to which you refer is utterly meaningless as the gross figure is the true cost. “It leads me to wonder whether the clerk lacks the accounting knowledge to produce these tools and perhaps you could let me know what accounting and budgeting training and/or qualifications the clerk has.” We will refer to his letter as “the Second Information Request”. 12. By letter dated 22 August 2011 the Council refused to respond to the requests set out in the Appellant’s letter because it took the view that he had conducted an eighteen month campaign of correspondence against the Council and the Clerk with the result that it was entitled to rely on FOIA section 14, which provides that: “(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious.” 13. The Council’s refusal was upheld in a letter to the Appellant dated 12 October 2011and the Appellant filed a complaint with the Information Commissioner on 16 November 2011. Investigation by the Information Commissioner and his Decision Notice 14. On 28 May 2012, following an investigation into the Appellant’s complaint, the Information Commissioner issued a decision notice. It recorded that the scope of the investigation had been the consideration of the following two issues: a. whether the Council held more information falling within the scope of the relevant information request, which should have been disclosed; and b. whether the Council had been justified in its reliance on FOIA section 14. However, the Information Commissioner also decided that the Clerk’s net salary and pension information constituted his personal data and that it was therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA section 1 because it fell within the scope of the exemption provided by FOIA section 40 (third party personal data). This part of his decision appeared to have ignored completely the fact that the Appellant had made it very clear that it was the gross salary that he sought. In the event the Appellant informed us during the hearing that the pension information had been disclosed to him by the Council, in any event, and that he had assembled sufficient information to calculate the gross salary. As he did not wish to pursue those elements of the original information request it is not necessary for us to examine in any greaterdetail the Information Commissioner’s error in this part of his decision notice. 15. As to the information held by the Council the Information Commissioner concluded that the Council had not been entitled to withhold material about variances between its budget and actual expenditure and he ordered it to be disclosed. The information was set out in a form, which had been completed in manuscript to identify variances between the expenditure/income between the financial years 2009/10 and 2010/11, with an explanation for any that exceeded 15%. 16. The Information Commissioner also ordered disclosure of a document, which had been discovered by the Council in the course of the investigation. This was described as a “breakdown” and was headed “Precept 2011/12”. It consisted of a table in which the first column was headed “Expenditure head” and listed some 35 items of expenditure. The second column was headed “31/3/10” (which we interpreted as a record of the actual expenditure under each of the itemised heads of expenditure, incurred during the financial year ended on that date). The third column was headed with the self-explanatory phrase “forecast 31/03/11” and the fourth “11/12”, which we interpret as either the budget for the financial year to 31 March 2012, or at least an indication of some of the items that might appear in it. 17. The Decision Notice recorded that the Council had confirmed to the Information Commissioner’s office that it kept records that were in accordance with its legal obligations but that, as a small parish council, it was permitted simply to summarise what had been paid out and received, together with a closing figure for the bank account(s). For transparency it recorded income (other than interest received, which it had disclosed to the Appellant) in the minutes of each Council meeting. Minutes were published on its website. It said that it was not required to provide a breakdown of its expenditure. On this basis, combined with the Council’s assurance that it had not deleted, destroyed or mislaid any relevant information, the Information Commissioner concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that no further relevant information was held. 18. The Information Commissioner also decided that the Second Information Request had been vexatious and that the Council had therefore been entitled to refuse it. He based his decision on a bundle of materials recording the written exchanges between the parties up to a date 20 working days after receipt of the request. He concluded that the history of correspondence on various subjects, together with evidence of discussions during Council meetings, supported the conclusion that the Second Information Request had been obsessive and that the Appellant had pursued a personal grievance against the Clerk over a period of time, which amounted to harassment. The Information Commissioner also concluded that the correspondence received from the Appellant had imposed a considerable burden on the Council and that the requested information would have provided limitedvalue to the Appellant and would probably have led to further exchanges focused on criticism of the Clerk’s competency. On the basis of those findings the Information Commissioner concluded that the information request had been vexatious and that the Council had therefore been entitled to refuse to comply with it. The Appeal to this Tribunal 19. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the decision notice on 18 June 2012 challenging both parts of the Information Commissioner’s decision notice. He asked for his appeal to be determined at a hearing, rather than on the papers, and directions were accordingly given for written submissions and supporting evidence to be filed beforehand. In the event the Information Commissioner decided that he would not appear at the hearing and it proceeded with only the Appellant addressing us. We will deal with each part of his case in turn. Did the Council continue to hold information falling within the scope of the First Information Request, which it had not disclosed? 20. The Appellant clarified, again, that he sought information about the Clerk’s gross salary, not the net salary, although, as indicated above, he did not pursue that item of information (or the pension information) at the hearing. Instead, he focused on the part of the First Information Request which asked for budgetary information. He relied, in particular, on the document that had been disclosed during the Information Commissioner’s investigation and suggested that it revealed that the Council had been carrying out an item by item budget assessment at the time when it was created. In his Grounds of Appeal he queried whether it was likely that the Council would have “abandoned the proper budgetary process midway through a year to produce a four line budget along the lines of opening balance less expenditure reductions add expenditure rises equals closing balance”. The Appellant also argued that the figure inserted for “Precept requirement” could only have been the result of a budgeting exercise. Finally, he stated that he had heard the Clerk state, during Council meetings, that he intended to amend the budget in line with information that had been provided to him by Councillors. However, the Appellant accepted during the hearing that this statement, appearing in his Grounds of Appeal and not supported by other corroboration, had limited value as evidence. 21. The Information Commissioner contented himself with a statement in his Response that the Appellant’s case amounted only to an opinion as to what information should have been recorded, which was not evidence of what had actually been recorded. He argued that, without further justification for believing that, on the balance of probabilities, a more detailed budget existed, the Appellant’s case could not be sustained.22. We believe that the Appellant has done more than say what he, as an accountant, believes should exist. He has drawn attention to two documents that provided some support for the argument that further budgeting materials must have been created. However, we find ourselves forced to accept that, faced with the Council’s very firm statement to the Information Commissioner that it did not prepare a more substantial budget than has already been disclosed, the Appellant has not presented us with sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that further information has been withheld by the Council. 23. The Appellant drew our attention to certain additional documents that came into existence after the date of his information request. Although they indicated that the Council was at that time generating more elaborate financial data, this did not assist the Appellant’s case. It is consistent with the Council having adopted more rigorous financial controls (possibly as a result of the Appellant’s complaints and questions) but does not point to the existence of information recording the outcome of such controls during earlier financial periods. Were the information requests vexatious? 24. On one reading of the papers submitted to us section 14 was only relied on as justification for refusing to comply with the Second Information Request. However, we consider that the position is not entirely clear and believe that, in case our decision on the first issue was to be successfully appealed, we should also determine whether the request for budget information in the First Information Request was vexatious. We will deal with that part of the First Information Request first, before considering whether the Second Information Request was vexatious. 25. The Appellant conceded that he had been persistent in pursuing the issues he had with the Council and that he adopted robust language at times. We would agree with the Information Commissioner that his correspondence went further on several occasions and that his criticisms were at times expressed in unnecessarily personal terms. The Appellant argued that, even if that was a justified criticism, correspondence on other disagreements should not have the effect of rendering the particular request under consideration vexatious. The Information Commissioner argued that the whole history should be taken into account because it pointed to an obsessive pursuit of the Council and the Clerk. 26. The contemporaneous records relied on by the Information Commissioner included both correspondence and records of events during the public part of Council meetings. In our view reports of what may or may not have been said or done at those meetings is not relevant to the issue we have to determine. Those events seem to have had no connection with the subject matter of the First InformationRequest and it would be unwise to conclude, from disputes between individuals about appropriate conduct at a public meeting, that an information request on a distinct issue was vexatious. We have therefore relied solely on what has become apparent to us from reading the correspondence between the parties. We also consider that some of the issues raised in that correspondence do not amount to information requests and that some of the issues under discussion were very remote from the subject matter of the information request under consideration. 27. When the history of communications on the question of financial recording and budgeting is separated from other issues that have been in dispute over the years, the pursuit of information seems not to have been obsessive, as the Information Commissioner has suggested. Viewed in that light it ought not to have imposed any significant burden on even a relatively lightly resourced public authority. The purpose of the enquiry seems to us to have been a justified one, as is evidenced by our surprise that, given the existence of the documents identified above, no detailed budgetary records have been said to exist. 28. Whether or not any of the Appellant’s other information requests, having different subject matter (some of them quite trivial), might have been characterised properly as vexatious is not an issue we have to consider, as the Council did not raise section 14 on those occasions. 29. It remains the case that the Appellant pursued the Clerk with a series of criticisms, including financial mismanagement, adopting a somewhat hectoring tone in his communications from time to time. We can well imagine that the Clerk felt harassed at times (although he generally demonstrated an ability to respond with some vigour) and we should certainly take into account this aspect of the overall history of communications between the parties. However, the persistence of the pursuit of information must be assessed, for section 14 purposes, in light of the seriousness of the issue being pursued and the openness of the public authority in responding to previous requests. Viewed in that context we do not believe that the Appellant was unreasonably persistent, or that the tone he adopted on occasions should have the effect of converting a reasonable pursuit of a legitimate train of enquiry into a vexatious request. We have already expressed our own concern at the Council’s apparent lack of records about the budgeting that appeared to have preceded its decision on its annual precept and it seems to us to have been reasonable for the Appellant to have pursued his enquiries on that subject matter with some vigour and persistence. 30. We conclude, therefore, that the part of the information request dealing with the, ultimately fruitless, pursuit of information about the Council’s annual budgets was not vexatious. We are unanimous on that aspect of the case. However we were unable to achieve unanimity, when we come to consider the other elements of requested information, namelya breakdown of the Clerk’s time in providing the answers to each of the points arising from the earlier request and his accounting and budgeting training and qualifications. Both arise from the Second Information Request and we will deal with each in turn. Time spent on earlier request: One of us regarded this as a reasonable and legitimate question to raise, given the Council’s decision to raise the issue of the cost cap in its previous letter. The view of this member of the panel was that, while the Appellant knew this request would annoy the Clerk, this was not the sole intention of the query. Being able to tell whether a request would involve chargeable work and the reason for the amount of time that would have to be taken is perfectly reasonable and therefore this request was not vexatious. However the other members of the panel believed that this represented a departure from the line of enquiry, which we have decided justified his pursuit of clarification on financial matters, and was targeted at the Clerk’s personal performance. It had. no purpose other than to vex the Clerk and was in fact more point scoring than a genuine request. On a majority decision, therefore, we conclude that this request was vexatious 31. Clerk’s qualifications: On this issue one of us, again, felt that the request was not vexatious. This panel member thought that, given the difficulty of obtaining clarification on the financial issues that had been raised, it was legitimate for the Appellant to raise this request even though the Appellant’s own statements during the hearing showed that he clearly knew the Clerk’s background and experience. This panel member acknowledges that the Appellant was definitely getting involved in points scoring with this request but balances that against the responses he was receiving which, if taken at face value, might be said not to accord with the Clerk’s background and even being intended to “wind up” the Appellant. Although borderline, therefore, this panel member felt that, given the level of obstruction the Appellant felt he had been subject to, the request fell on the side of not being vexatious. . The other members of the panel noted that questions about the Clerk’s qualifications had been raised previously and that his competence had been questioned, in quite personal tones, on previous questions. In the view of these members the fact that the request was expressed in slightly different terms from the previous request did not mean that it was appropriate to pursue. It was an example of a requester being more intent on vilifying an individual by returning to a question that had been substantially responded to previously. Even if regarded as a genuine request it represented a different line of enquiry from the one which we have found to have been justified and is sufficiently distinct from the subject matter of that enquiry that, in the view of these panel members, it is not capable of acquiring legitimacy from it. On a majority, therefore, we conclude that this request was also vexatious.32. It follows that we have decided, by a majority, that the Second Information Request was vexatious, that the Council had been entitled to refuse it on that basis and that the Information Commissioner was correct in this part of his Decision Notice. 33. We should add that the Appellant expressed concern that the Council had indicated at one stage that its decision that the information request was vexatious had the effect of making any future requests from the Appellant also vexatious. The Council subsequently modified or clarified its position, to explain (as we understand it) that it would only regard as vexatious any requests for information about its decision or any requests that repeated, in effect, the rejected request. However, in the light of that potential misunderstanding, we should make it absolutely clear that our decision affects only the particular information request on which we have adjudicated and not any other that may have been made in the past or may be made in the future. As to the past, we have indicated that we would have had some sympathy for the Council had it challenged one or more of the Appellant’s other information requests under FOIA section 14. But it did not do so and chose, as the issue on which to make its stand, one that seems to us to have been of greater significance than some of the other, frankly silly, points the Appellant has sought to pursue from time to time. As to the future, clearly the whole history of the communications between the parties is capable of having an impact on how any future requests may be handled. The fact that we have decided that the history did not justify refusal of the particular information request underlying this Appeal does not mean that it will not have a more decisive effect on future enquiries from the Appellant, whether concerning financial issues or other matters.

"239","Procedural Refusal","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Appeal No. EA/2011/0298 BETWEEN: VIVIENNE EDWARDS Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent Held on the papers on: 22 June 2012 Before: C Taylor, R Enderby, N Makanji Subject Matter Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’): s.12 DECISION For the reasons given below, the Tribunal allows the appeal and issues a Substituted Decision Notice.Substituted Decision Notice Dated: 16 October 2012 Public Authority: Ministry of Justice Address: 102 Petty France London SW1H 9AJ For the reasons set out below, the Ministry of Justice is to investigate whether any of the requested information is held electronically within 31 calendar days as an alternative approach to searching for the information in the archives. Whilst the Ministry of Justice will know best how its material is organised, their alternative searches should include those listed in paragraph 36 of this decision. We do not anticipate such searches will take more than a couple of hours and therefore should be within the cost limit. However, if the MoJ concludes that even if it were to limit its search to these alternative approaches, this would nonetheless exceed the appropriate limit under section 12 FOIA, it is required to contact the Appellant within 31 calendar days to advise her as to how to refine her list - that is categorised into more than one policy area - so as to bring it within the cost limit in accordance with s16 FOIA (see paragraph 23). 2 EA/2011/0298Reasons For The Decision Background 1. Under changes to the Machinery of Government announced in 2007, sections of the Home Office were merged with what was then the Department for Constitutional Affairs, to create the Ministry of Justice (‘MoJ’). 2. The new department took on responsibility for archived records that related to the services transferred to it and any relevant freedom of information (‘FOI’) requests. The Request for Information 3. On 21 January 2011, the Appellant sent an FOI request to the MoJ, stating: “I produced the Report of the Advisory Council on Openness in the Public Sector. The Report and all the Advisory Council papers were published on the website, but have now probably been archived. <U+F0B7> A copy of the Advisory Council’s report to the Home Secretary which was completed in December 1999 <U+F0B7> A copy of the submission to Jack Straw, then Home Secretary, submitting the report to him <U+F0B7> A copy of the letter Jack Straw sent to public authorities about the report 4. I would also like to know if any review or evaluation of the Freedom Information Act or progress towards increasing openness in the public sector, is underway or planned, apart that is from the annual reports published on the website. Witnesses 5. I was head of the team dealing with witnesses from 2001 to 2003. There is information on the internet about the joint cjs project “No Witness, No Justice” which was started in 2004, but I cannot find anything about the earlier work done in the Home Office (and which would now be within the scope of the Ministry of Justice) to review services for witnesses or the report of that work which was called “No Witness - No Justice”, and which in fact introduced that term. 6. I would like copies of: A copy of the submission to Lord Falconer in spring/summer 2002 recommending that a working group be established to review the services for witnesses in the light of the IPPR Report “Reluctant Witness” and other information A copy of the IPPR Report “Reluctant Witness” which had been sent to the Home Office and which helped trigger the review A copy of the report of May 2003 of the inter-agency working group on witnesses entitled “No Witness - No Justice: Towards a national strategy for witnesses”. This was published on the cjs website at the time, but is no longer available. A copy of the submission to Lord Falconer submitting the report to him 7. I would also like information about how the report was followed up and how it was incorporated into the cjs project “No Witness, No Justice”, with copies of any key documents. The Probation Service 8. When I was in the Probation Unit from 1993 to 1997 I was in the lead in changing the arrangements for the recruitment and training of probation officers. I would like copies of the following documents. I can’t recall the dates of all of them, but they were very significant developments in that area of work and it should be possible to identify them. The judgment in the 1995 judicial review NAPO (the National Association of Probation Officers) versus the Home Office – this was a legal challenge against the break with the Diploma in Social Work as a mandatory qualification for probation officers. The Efficiency Report by [XX] on the sponsorship scheme for probation trainees. I think this was completed in late summer 1994. 3 EA/2011/0298The consultation document issued to the Probation Service on proposed changes to the arrangements for training of probation officers following [XX]’s report and my subsequent note summarising the responses received. Key documents in the breach of contract case brought by the National Union of Probation Officers in respect of a year’s intake of sponsored students. From what I recall the work on this was done over the winter 1993/94. There will be a note by me setting out the position when the summonses for breach of contract were received, submissions to Ministers, legal advice from Counsel, and a letter from me to the students informing them of the decision to refund them. The new recruitment publication issued in 19945 called “Facing up to Crime, the submission I put to Lady Blatch seeking her agreement to its publication, and the letter to the probation service information them of its availability. I don’t think the publication is now available elsewhere. Independent Monitoring Boards (then Boards of Visitors) 9. I am interested in looking at some documents about Boards of Visitors, including some that should by now be in the National Archives having passed the 30 year rule, but have not been able to trace any. Perhaps the best way to deal with this would be for me to talk to someone in that area of work, if 1 you can arrange that. I could then submit a more specific written request.” 4. On 11 March, the MoJ refused the request. It explained that it had searched 109,644 files and that it estimated that extracting the information would exceed the appropriate limit for the cost of compliance set under s.12(1) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). It did not provide an explanation as to how that cost estimation had been reached. 5. On 12 April, the Appellant requested the MoJ review its decision. The MoJ’s internal review of 17 May confirmed its position but also stated that the initial search of files being manually reviewed had exceeded the guidance limit of three and a half days of staff hours. It gave no further detail on how the time had been spent. On 18 May, the department replied to a further letter from the Appellant, and confirmed that it held some of the information requested. 6. On 31 May 2011, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner about the handling of the request and the MoJ’s management of its records. In its decision notice of 21 November 2011, the Commissioner concluded that the MoJ’s cost estimate was reasonable based on its calculations of the time and effort and what the Commissioner considered to be the considerable scope of the request. However, it found that the MoJ breached s.16 FOIA by failing to advise and assist the Appellant as to how she might refine her request so as to bring it within the cost limit. We were told that the Commissioner ‘dealt with’ the complaint about the MoJ’s record management separately, but were given no further details.2 The Appeal 7. On 16 December 2011, the Appellant appealed to the Tribunal. She confirmed at the case management hearing that her grounds were: “The Commissioner erred in concluding that compliance with the request would be properly estimated to exceed the ‘appropriate limit’ under [the FOIA], in part because of misconstruing the Appellant’s request, and the structure of the groups of material requested.” 1 The text of the request has been reproduced in full because the Appellant considered that summaries made by the other parties could have distorted the meaning. 2 As the parties are aware, the Commissioner has relevant powers under s51 FOIA to investigate matters such as whether a public authority conforms with the proposed practices set out in the relevant codes under s.s45 and 46 FOIA. However, whether he chooses to exercise them is not a matter that is reviewable by the Tribunal. 4 EA/2011/0298The Task of the Tribunal 8. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or whether he should have exercised any discretion he had differently. 9. This appeal focuses on the whether the costs exemption was properly relied upon. As was made clear to the Appellant at the preliminary hearing for case management of this appeal, our decision will not deal with arguments and evidence submitted that relates to matters beyond our remit, such as: a. the suitability or quality of the MoJ’s record management; or b. the manner of the Commissioner’s handling of the investigation. Whilst we do not have jurisdiction to do this, we may consider (and have considered) the matters afresh – we may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and make different findings of fact from him. The Law 10. A public authority is exempt from complying with an information request where it estimates that the cost of doing so would exceed the ‘appropriate limit’. (See s.12(1) and (2) FOIA). The appropriate limit for a government department is equivalent to 24 hours of the public authority’s time.3 In reaching its cost estimate, “(3) … a public authority may, for the purpose of its estimate, take account only of the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in- (a) determining whether it holds the information, (b) locating the information, or a document which may contain the information, (c) retrieving the information, or a document which may contain the information, and (d) extracting the information from a document containing it. (See regulation 4(3).) 11. We therefore need to consider whether the authority’s cost estimate is reasonable. 12. We agree with previous decisions of the First-tier Tribunal that the authority’s estimate should be sensible, realistic and supported by cogent evidence. When estimating the cost (or time), it may not simply “go through the motions”, as this would not produce a bona fide estimate and so not justify the exemption. It should consider if there are alternative methods of complying with the request that would clearly bring it within the cost limit. 4 As stated in Roberts v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0050 para.s 12-13: “Section 12 provides that the public authority may rely on its costs estimate to refuse a request … the word “estimate” itself provides some guidance. It points to something more than a guess or an arbitrarily selected figure. It requires a process to be undertaken, which will involve 3 See regulations 3 and 4(4) of the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004. Referred to here as ‘the regulations’ or individually as ‘regulation’. 4 We refer to reasoning in Randall v Information Commissioner EA/2007/0004, Gerald James and Cabinet Office and Government Departments EA/2006/003, which we adopt here. 5 EA/2011/0298an investigation followed by an exercise of assessment and calculation. The investigation will need to cover matters such as the amount of information covered by the request, its location, and the hourly cost of those who will have the task of extracting it (in this case a rate imposed by the Regulations). The second stage will involve making an informed and intelligent assessment of how many hours the relevant staff members are likely to take to extract the information. Clearly the whole exercise must be undertaken in good faith and, as the Regulation provides, involve an element of reasonableness. …We can envisage circumstances where it might be concluded that a public authority ought not to be permitted to rely on the reasonableness of its estimate if it had failed to give appropriate consideration to a cheaper available means for doing so. It does not follow from this that it only needs a person requesting information to suggest one alternative which the public authority had not considered for it to be prevented from relying on its estimate. It is only if an alternative exists that is so obvious to consider that disregarding it renders the estimate unreasonable that it might be open to attack. And in those circumstances it would not matter whether the public authority already knew of the alternative or had it drawn to its attention by the requestor or any other third party.” Evidence 13. The parties submitted witness evidence, submissions, previous cases and a considerable number of documents as supporting evidence. We have considered all of this, even if not specifically referred to below. (We have added titles and emphasis to the evidence and submissions below purely for ease of reference.) Appellant Evidence 14. The Appellant submitted a lengthy witness statement, including that: The Request a. Her request related to work she had been involved as a civil servant. The range of documents and information were from different stages of her career. They reflected significant developments either being ground breaking or high profile in some way, and were about issues that were still of current interest. They were from policy areas on Freedom of Information, Witnesses and Probation. The request grouped the documents under these headings. b. The request was made to the MoJ because the main bulk of the work requested would now be in the MoJ. The Search - State of Records c. She had been told the refusal of the request was because it would exceed the cost limit. This was because they were in former Home Office files that were not listed in accordance with the MOJ records index and their normal electronic search methods could not be used. d. She had found it difficult to believe that the Home Office would expect a receiving department to work from just a list of file numbers with no way 6 EA/2011/0298of identifying the subject matter. However, the MoJ had sent her sample spreadsheets to verify this difficulty. She noted the spreadsheets seemed useless as a way of identifying files. She thought it could have implications for the effectiveness of normal Departmental business if staff could not identify or retrieve information from the official records, and could not establish if there were any difficulties for staff in their normal day to day work, or in developing and implementing policy and preparing advice to Ministers. Alternative Searches to Mitigate Costs? e. She had asked the relevant MoJ official whether policy units who might be able to help trace the information had been involved. This had not been not fruitful. 15. Letter to Appellant from Gus O’Donnell of 12 September 2011, explaining: a. “Many areas of government continue to rely upon the legacy of paper records and files before the onset of desktop computing. A number of shortcuts were taken in the 1990s that led to a large number of files being registered by number without further subject information. A large number of these files have subsequently been transferred to two other Departments, including the Ministry of Justice, in line with Machinery of Government changes. The lack of detailed subject information for a large number of files is of concern … and [the Home Office and MoJ] are working to resolve this…the Home Office was put under special monitoring provisions at the end of last year because it was failing to respond to all FOI requests as quickly as required by the Act. Since then, however, the department has turned in an impressive improvement… In my view this demonstrates that the department does have systems in place to identify and retrieve information being requested.”5 16. Sample of spreadsheet forwarded by MoJ to Appellant: 1. The witness later clarified that this work was considered important, and would be concluded as soon as possible. 2. 7 EA/2011/0298MoJ Evidence 17. MoJ letter to the Appellant of 11 March 2011: a. “The Department has made reasonable enquiries to assist you with your request and I confirm that the Department holds substantial amount of information relating to the former Home Office…Our records management team have searched through records of 109,644 former Home Office files on a series of spreadsheets manually, looking for each topic in turn. So far, we have been able to locate four bulky files on topics “Facing Up to Crime-Update” and one file entitled “No Witness…” Regrettably we were unable to find any copies of documents in these files states in your letter. In order for us to extract the information in the form that you have requested it would require us to search through thousands of files individually since 1994. We estimate this task would exceed the appropriate limit set out in the Act…” 18. On 18 May, the department replied to a further letter from the Appellant, and confirmed that it held some of the information requested. a. “MoJ now has the most comprehensive version of the list of files it is possible to have but it is not possible to obtain all of the file details, without retrieving every single file from storage, and then entering their information upon the lists that MoJ now holds. This is therefore what the Records Management Services within MoJ is currently in the process of compiling, but as approximately a quarter of a million files were involved, and the ordinary, on-going work of RMS must continue unaffected, it is not possible to give a precise date by which this work will be completed.” b. It attached email correspondence between the MoJ and Home Office on efforts made to try to get more information than it had from the spreadsheets such as file titles. These pre-dated the request. 19. MoJ letter to the Commissioner of 8 September 2011: a. “It has been estimated that without knowing which files to target it would require looking manually through all of the 219,363 files held. To establish whether the section 12 exemption applied, a search of 109,644 ex-Home Office files within scope of the request were manually reviewed. There were still 109,719 that had not been searched. It has been estimated it took in total 26 and a half hours to deal with a sample of the information requested. b. If, as estimated, it takes 26 and a half hours to identify and then search through 109,644 files out of a total of 219,363, leaving 109,719 files still to be searched, this means that it took 26 and half hours to do just under half of the work that would have been necessary to comply with the request. Therefore, the estimated total cost of work hours for one person to search all the relevant documents and comply with the request would be approximately £1325-00(twice as much), which is above the £600 cost limit imposed on Freedom of Information requests. c. As was explained to the requester in the section 12 refusal notice provided to her on the 11 March 2011, the former Home Office files are not listed in accordance with MoJ records index numbers therefore the 8 EA/2011/0298normal electronic search methods to look for information could not be used. The problem is that the files belonged to the Home Office, and became the responsibility of MoJ upon its creation, but they were not listed in our records indexes. This meant that whilst the information is held electronically, the searching through lists would have to be conducted individually and would require the file lists being separately searched. Calculation: d. ‘From the sample determining whether it holds the information’: ‘It took an estimated 22 hours and 30 minutes to investigate which documents from the 219,363 might be of relevance.’ e. ‘…c. Retrieving the information, or a document containing it = 3 hours 45 minutes: As the information being requested is not held in a readily accessible format it would involve manually searching through the files to locate what information is held relevant to the request. The information requested is archived so it proved necessary to recall a sample of the files from storage to locate the relevant information. It took approximately three hours and forty-five minutes to complete these tasks on a sample of the documents.’ f. ‘d. Extracting the information from a document containing it =15 minutes. The information would have to be extracted from the document it is held in which depending on the file could take fifteen minutes. Please note that a more precise estimate is not possible due to lack of consistency in the size of the files, the time it would take to obtain the necessary information would be dependent upon each file. So while it may be possible to find some of the information relatively quickly for some, for others this could involve exhaustive checks which may well not yield the information required. It is not possible to select a typical file, or sample to run an estimate as no single file is typical…’ 20. Testimony of MoJ official working in records management and FOI requests, included: Calculation a. It had taken 26.5 hours for her to identify and search through 109,644 files out of a total of 219,363 files. After searching through 109,644 files, she had been told to stop, as there had already been spent a total of slightly over the three and a half working days limit that is set for such work (albeit in parcels of between one and three hours, over a period of three weeks, rather than three and a half days of continuous work). This left 109,719 files still to be searched through, which meant that it took 26.5 hours to do just under half of the work that would have been necessary to complete the search. It would therefore have cost twice as much for the MoJ to search through all records necessary. b. She had calculated the 26.5 hours by going back through her calendar to see how many hours she and her colleague had spent ‘searching the records held for the information necessary to be able to identify the files, within which would be held the information and/or copy documents … requested’. 9 EA/2011/0298c. A colleague with knowledge of the lists of records transferred from the Home Office had assisted in ‘populating’ the lists of those records with the information needed to make those lists amenable to search tools, and was able to advise and assist in searching through those listings. He had spent time sending for the few files that she had been able to identify as being possible sources of the information sought. d. She had not conducted a search of any websites - neither MoJ’s nor any external websites - because this did not fall within her remit, of searching records held by MoJ in order to provide a response to the access request. Reason search took so long e. The records system that originally held the information the Appellant requested had belonged to the Home Office. The MoJ had been provided with copies of the lists held on the Home Office system relating to the records. The MoJ did not control the content of the list of files which were transferred from the Home Office, nor any control or even input into the policy, practices and procedures governing the content or records management practices to be applied to the lists’ ‘style’ relating to the information with which MoJ was being provided. Neither did it have the authority to refuse to accept such transfer of records or lists of records, because of the way that the [Home Office] had listed those records. f. The files listed, had, in the vast majority of cases, only the individual file reference number listed in the relevant spreadsheets, and no information as to the title or subject matter of the content of those files. As the request referred specifically to the titles of the files within which were held the documents and/or information being sought, there was, and is, no way of knowing whether or not any given file numbers relate to one of the subjects of the request. g. This made the search far more time consuming job than it needed to be, because every individual page, on each section of each spreadsheet had to be checked separately for each separate item being sought, by individual searches being made using the standard search methods for such records since metadata searching was not an option. This was something over which the MoJ had no control. h. Initially they were not allowed to have access to the original Home Office computer system that housed the lists of these records. The Home Office did eventually allow MoJ staff to interrogate its system to decide which file lists needed to be transferred to MoJ. However, the system only held file titles for a very small proportion of the records listed, such that the MoJ was still faced with only having file numbers recorded. Unless the individual file reference numbers were known, the process of searching for specific or individual records was cumbersome. Efforts to improve record system i. The MoJ had since taking over responsibility for the records in question (and all other ‘legacy’ records transferred records from the Home Office in relation to e.g. Prisons, Offender Management and the Probation Service, to be joined with what was then called the Department for Constitutional Affairs, so as to form the MoJ). It has been working to correct this 10 EA/2011/0298omission of information in the records with which it was provided, by virtue of having such records obtained from [storage], and their titles added on to the spreadsheets of lists. Duty to Advise and Assist s.16 FOIA j. When they were informed of the instruction to advise and assist [we presume this was after the decision notice], there was nothing they could suggest [that would help bring the request within the cost limit], because the Appellant had provided considerable information in respect of the records in which she was interested in her original request. It was the actual file reference numbers that were needed to shorten the time needed. The fault did not lie with the request, nor with the MoJ’s records management systems, but with the format in which the records details had been held, before the MoJ inherited them. k. They suggested the Appellant refine her request to ask for: “only one of the records from those originally requested, then that might bring the request within the cost limit and MoJ will respond to the new request in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.” This she did. Unfortunately, it was still not possible to find the documents in which she was interested. l. Despite the on-going work being conducted by the MoJ to correct the omission of necessary information in the lists, by obtaining records from store and adding their titles to the spreadsheets, the file the Appellant was interested in had been identified. 21. In response to further questions posed by the Tribunal and Appellant: Search for Information Held Elsewhere a. By virtue of the medium in which the listings of these types of records were held, the only possibility of locating any information listed within these records, was by checking the listings of records still held in archive. There were no previous responses or provisions of information upon which the MoJ could rely, or of which MoJ could make use, to mitigate the costs of this search. Tribunal Question: the Appellant said she had asked whether policy units who had dealt with the areas of policy the documents related might be able to help trace the information. Had they been asked? Witness Response: b. The relevant official to whom the question had been addressed had told her these policy teams were not approached for help. The policy units could not have been in a position to suggest how to provide all the documents originally requested because any search for these documents would have had to include all information held both electronically and in the hardcopy manual files - because the request did not exclude hardcopy information. c. In relation to the hardcopy files, the record management unit are responsible for hardcopy files. They would have had to have been engaged by the policy units to locate these files and would not have been 11 EA/2011/0298able to assist records management in this extensive investigation to try to locate the files requested. d. If the request had been just for electronic information, then the policy units may have been able to offer some useful guidance in where to search and how to comply with that request, although section 12 may have still applied. However, because the scope of the request was much wider, because it asked for all information on several policy issues and there was no suggestion it did not include all the hardcopies files held, a wider search was called for. This is why the ICO accepted that MoJ could ask the requester to refine the scope of the request. Tribunal Question: The MoJ letter to the Commissioner of 8 September 2011 indicates that the information was held electronically. If so, please explain why it would not have been possible to simply use a word search to find the information? Witness Response: e. The information that was held electronically was not listed in the MoJ records indexes. This meant that whilst the information was held electronically, each individual list would have to be searched. The facility of a word search was used. The individual lists of files transferred from Home Office to MOJ were contained within individual spreadsheets. There were numerous individual lists, which had to be separately searched for each individual document and type of document and/or record on the list submitted by the Appellant. Tribunal Question: The witness stated that the files listed, had, in the vast majority of cases, only the individual file reference number listed in the relevant spreadsheets, and no information as to the title or subject matter of the content of those files. Were the ‘minority’ of files with more than a reference number all checked? Witness Response: f. Yes. Tribunal Question: Relating to the inconsistency between witness testimony calculating time spent to have been 26.5 hours and that of the letter on 8 September which stated an estimate of 26 hours and implied this was not the time spent, but a forward looking estimate of time that could have been spent. Request for an explanation of this and how the estimate was reached in both cases; when the calendar was looked at to calculate time spent and whether there are print-offs of the calendar. Witness Response: g. The search undertaken referred to the search of the spreadsheets to identify files which might contain the information sought. The figures of 26 hours and 26½ hours were obtained from her looking at her calendar to see how much time she had blocked out having undertaken this work. When she was asked at a later date how much time she had spent, she had to list individual amounts of time for individual activities. This was when she realised she had missed something on the first occasion that 12 EA/2011/0298she was asked, and the time taken was actually 26½ hours. The figure of 26½ hours was not an estimate. It was a calculation of the time that was spent searching just under half of the spreadsheets for the records. The estimate was for how much time would be needed to complete all of the work therefore errs on the side of caution, rather than overstating the case. The estimate of 15 minutes related to how much time would be needed to conduct a search of any individual manual files which had been identified as potentially holding some of the information sought, and this was based upon how long the work took, in relation to the few files which my spreadsheet searches had identified. h. At the time that she was looking at her calendar to prepare these estimates, it would have been possible to print off its content. However, she said that she did not do this for two reasons: [a] she did not know at that time that the new computer system to be introduced would have the effect of preventing access to the archived portions of the calendar, thereby rendering copies necessary, if access were to be required at a later date; [b] the Information Commissioner’s Office trusted the figures provided by her and did not demand proof by way of hardcopies. i. The difference between the 26.5 hours of time she said she had spent searching and the MoJ’s letter to the Commissioner that implies that at least 22.5 hours was spent this way could be explained by the fact that “searching” in the MoJ letter refers to actually searching the spreadsheets themselves. The 26.5 hours in her statement also accounted for peripheral tasks to facilitate those searches such as identifying which listings of former Home Office records had to be searched, obtaining information about storage of those records liaising with Data Access and Compliance Unit etc. However, for the avoidance of doubt, the majority of the 26.5 hours was spent actually searching the spreadsheets themselves. j. However, her colleague assisted in searching through the lists and sending for a few files that I had identified as being possible sources of the information. From memory, this involvement amount to approximately one and a half hours and this time was included in the total number hours referred to, i.e., 26.5 hours. The time spent by Data Access and Compliance Unit searching files was not included in the 26.5 hours total time spent. 22. Tribunal Question: The Appellant asked (a) why the witness statement did not give any information about how they had identified the sample of files to recall from the archives; (b) how the statement that the official had spent 26.5 hours searching through 109,644 files could be correct as this would be mean 0.87 seconds for each file; and (c) whether she had actually carried out the work up to the limit imposed in the regulations particularly if the records were in the archives. Witness Response: a. There were no ‘sample’ of files. All files which her searches of the spreadsheets identified as potentially containing items from the Appellant’s list were obtained from storage and searched by the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit. She did not conduct a search of any manual files. She conducted a search of spreadsheets so as to identify the manual files to be retrieved from storage and searched. 13 EA/2011/0298b. The search on the spreadsheets was conducted electronically. She would have thought the speed in which a computer carried out searches would be considerably less than 0.87 seconds per item. The 26½ hours of work she conducted was spent identifying the sources of information needed i.e. electronically searching the spreadsheets containing the lists of the records which could, potentially, hold the information requested. No manual files were searched by her, so the work of searching those files, by the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit would have to be added to the total of time spent by MoJ in responding to this request. c. There was more than adequate proof of the seriousness of the efforts made by the MoJ, so as to provide the Appellant with the information sought, not least by the time spent in searching for it, as set out above. 23. As far as the MoJ’s witness was aware, no one else has made a request from the MoJ for access in relation to Home Office records, such that this was the only refusal to have been made. However, the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit did not hold statistical information about requests. 24. Tribunal Question: what information and advice was provided to the Appellant? Witness Response: a. Aside from that contained within the letter written to the Appellant, following on from the instruction received from the Information Commissioner, the Appellant was also provided with copies of e-mails exchanged between MoJ and the Home Office in relation to the difficulties which MoJ was experiencing in regards to: obtaining any listings of the records which had been transferred; and identifying the records which had been transferred, by virtue of the amount of information contained within the spreadsheets listing those records. b. The Appellant was also provided with numerous copies of the actual spreadsheets themselves, so as to give her first hand evidence of the problems that MoJ was experiencing in its efforts to supply her with the information sought. Submissions Appellant Submissions 25. The Appellant’s submissions were lengthy and we cannot address every point. She asserted that the Decision Notice contained errors: a. in claiming that the refusal of her FOI request stemmed from the scope of the request: that the reason for the cost limit being exceeded was because of the scope of her FOI request and there was no need to look into any other issues; (We note that this was not disputed by the other parties and do not take it further.) b. in accepting the explanations and cost estimates given by the MOJ without further investigation. 26. She also questioned the validity of the MoJ’s witness evidence. (This included questions summarised in paragraph 21 above.) She remained concerned that 14 EA/2011/0298there might not have been any real commitment to providing the information requested. Search for Information Held Elsewhere 27. She suggested that the MoJ could have asked the library if they had any of the documents or any other information that could help identify files and a web search. 28. She thought that many of the staff in the MoJ would have transferred from the Home Office and some that were involved in the initiatives covered in my FOI request are in the MoJ. She thought that it could have saved a lot of time if the policy units had been consulted when it became clear that the information could not be readily found from the files. Reasonably Expected Cost Estimate 29. She asserted that regulation 4(3) allowed a public authority to take into account the costs it “reasonably” expected to incur in determining whether it holds the information. She implied that the costs were unreasonable. She made the following points: a. The regulations were unlikely to have envisaged the use of s.12 FOIA considering it ‘reasonable’ that a public authority would have to search through so many files to find information because there was no way of identifying the files to target. b. This would in effect enable the interpretation of Section 12 and the subordinate legislation to override the recognised main aims of the primary legislation. This appeared to be an absurdity and not proper use of the regulations. She asserted that relying on the fee regulations to refuse requests when basic systems to support the FOIA were absent were an improper use of the regulations and undermined the effective operation of the FOIA. The importance of record management to FOI was summed up: “Any freedom of information legislation is only as good as the quality of the records to which it provides access. Such rights are of little use if reliable records are not created in the first place, if they cannot be found when needed or if the arrangements for their eventual archiving or destruction are inadequate. Consequently, lf public authorities are strongly encouraged to pay heed to the guidance in the Code6.” c. Parliamentary papers indicated that on the question of fees, generally there was an assurance that they would not be set in a way that would act as a deterrent to the dissemination of information, which was the whole purpose of the FOIA. Using the costs ceiling in this way provided a cover for possible maladministration. This would allow a public authority to get round FOIA by not ensuring that a system is in place to access even its core records. To apply a cost limit in the circumstances of this case would result in an absurdity. She asserted that there was some discretion in Section 12 of the FOIA because the cost limit is not mandatory. 6 The Code of Practice under s.45 FOIA (‘the code’). 15 EA/2011/0298d. She could not see what else she could have done to make the request more precise or clearer or to enable it to be met within the cost ceiling. She had been told by the MoJ that they would need a file number to search further. The Code of Practice under s.45 FOIA (‘the code’) stated that it was not reasonable to expect FOI applicants to possess identifiers like file reference numbers. (See Para 11 of the code.) Record Management By the Information Commissioner in guidance on record management: “ 6. Can poor records management lead to a breach of the Act? Poor records management itself is not a breach of the FOIA. However, the FOIA sets out timetables for complying with a request, makes sure the costs of retrieving information are reasonable, and asserts that all recorded information held, wherever it is located within the public authority, can potentially be disclosed. If poor records management leads to the authority not meeting any of these requirements, it will constitute a breach of the FOIA and we will be able to consider using our enforcement powers.” Duty to Advise and Assist: e. She agreed that providing advice and assistance under Section 16(1) of the FOIA would not have made any difference to the cost of complying with the request. MoJ Submissions 30. The MoJ argued that: a. The only issue for determination was whether the limit of £600 was properly applied, given the nature of the request and the records to be searched. Cost estimate b. The Second Respondent had carried out work up to the cost limit. This discharged the obligations upon it. Search c. There could be no doubt as to the state of the records or extent (and therefore cost) of the searches that would be required to locate the information. The witness testimony made clear that even an apparently straightforward request, including with an identified title and date of a document, may not easily or speedily be fulfilled. d. The Second Respondent was only required to make a reasonable search. In determining what would be reasonable, the person making the request had to take the public authority as it finds it.7 If it was clear that on a reasonable search, that the cost limit would be exceeded, there was no basis for questioning reliance on those provisions by suggesting that some other method should have been used. The activities described by 7 As concluded in Adlam v Information Commissioner EA/2006/0079, para. 81. 16 EA/2011/0298the witness in the tome spent on the request fell clearly within what could be taken into account in determining the cost of complying with a request under regulation 4(3). In particular, the time was spent largely in ‘locating’ the information. e. The Appellant appeared to be suggesting that because of the state of the records, the MoJ was not entitled to rely upon the cost limit in the regulations. She argued that the work required would not have been required if the Home Office and MoJ had not allegedly committed ‘failings in record management’. The MoJ did not admit any failings, but in any event she had disclosed no error or law or wrongful exercise of discretion because the regulations did not provide that they should be disapplied or modulated to reflect the actual state of the records within which searches were being undertaken. Were this to happen, it would then always be open to a person requesting information to allege that the only reason the request could not be fulfilled was on account of the physical state of the records. Commissioner Submissions 31. The representative for the Commissioner argued that: a. Based on the evidence and the MoJ’s witness statement, the cost of compliance with the request would exceed the appropriate costs limit. b. That the records may be poorly managed or organised did not preclude an authority from relying on section 12 FOIA.8 He noted that paragraph 27 of the Commissioner’s guidance 9 stated “…it is realistic to accept that it will take longer to find the requested information where the relevant records are poorly organised or filed”. Our Findings 32. In summary, we accept that the MoJ reasonably expected to incur costs exceeding the appropriate limit in searching through the archived files. However, faced with a defunct system where it was clear from the outset that establishing the basics of whether the information was held would be likely to take an extraordinary long time, the MoJ should have considered whether they could first make a quicker search in an alternative location for at least part of the requested information, such as doing a word search of the electronic records. This would seem to us the most obvious step, and the Appellant had requested it. Nevertheless, we think it likely that an alternative search would not have produced all the requested information, given its age and origins not being in the MoJ. Therefore, ultimately the search would have had to be progressed to the archives, and then exceeded the cost limit. Under, s.16 FOIA, the MoJ should have advised the witness of how she might narrow her request to fall within the cost limit by, for example, excluding any search of hard copies. We set out below how we reached this position. 33. The following is not in dispute and in any way accept: 8 He gave the pertinent example of Cooksey v Information Commissioner & Greater Manchester Police EA/2010/0113. 9 See Guidance on the Commissioner’s website on section 12 FOIA: “Requests where the cost of compliance with a request exceeds the appropriate limit.” 17 EA/2011/0298a. The relevant archived records comprise 219,363 files and are not organised or indexed to a usable extent. b. The MoJ held spreadsheets which listed each file. However, in the vast majority of cases, the spreadsheets only contained the individual file reference number and gave no information as to the title, subject matter or contents of those files. c. The legacy of paper records from the Home Office were such that a large number of files in the 1990s had been registered by number without further subject information. 34. The MoJ’s approach to estimating the cost of compliance was to actually conduct a search. It looked through the spreadsheets and checked more fully the minority that listed more than a reference number. It would have been better if the MoJ had instead presented a more thorough and reasoned analysis of their cost estimate, as illustrated in other decisions, such as the Roberts case above. (Such an approach might involve taking one file and timing how long it took to search it and then multiplying it by a reasonable fraction of the total number of files.) We found the MoJ’s evidence confusing and difficult to piece together. On the basis of that information, we have doubts as to the amount of time to the MoJ actually spent searching for the requested information. For instance: MoJ Letter a. The MoJ letter of 8 September to the Commissioner stated that 26 hours had been spent manually reviewing 109,644 files. It gave no proper detail of how the figure was reached or the time taken up. It reasoned it would take double as long to complete the search. b. Rather confusingly, the letter then presented calculations for complying with the request would require determining whether the information was held, retrieving and extracting it. Within this it stated that: i. it took 22.5 hours to ‘investigate which documents from the 219,363 might be of relevance’; ii. it took three hours and 45 minutes to ‘locate the relevant information’ from a sample of files obtained from storage; iii. the information would have to be ‘extracted from the document it is held in which depending on the file could take 15 minutes.’ So, it seemed from this calculation that the MoJ were asserting they had spent 26.25 hours to date. Ignoring the slight inconsistency of 15 minutes, a) we were still no clearer as to how that time had been spent, and b) there seemed to be inconsistencies with the testimony from the witness. Testimony c. The witness stated: i. That it had taken her 26.5 hours over a period of weeks to identify and search through 109,644 files out of a total of 219,363 files. 18 EA/2011/0298She had calculated the 26.5 hours by going back through her calendar, but that it was no longer possible for her to provide that calendar. We would have thought the calendar details should have been provided to the Commissioner. ii. A colleague had assisted (for 1.5 hours included in the 26.5 hours) in searching through the lists and sending for the few files that she had been able to identify as being possible sources of the information sought. iii. In response to our further questions, that: a) the 26.5 hours search referred to the search of the spreadsheets to identify files which might contain the information sought. This was later amended to 22.5hours plus peripheral tasks. b) there were no ‘sample’ of files as implied by the MoJ letter. All files which her searches of the spreadsheets identified as potentially containing items from the Appellant’s list were obtained from storage and searched by the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit. She did not conduct a search of any manual files so the time spent by the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit would have to be added to the 26.5 hour total of time spent by MoJ in responding to this request. Spreadsheets d. We find it hard to see how one could spend any significant time – whether 22.5 or 26.5 hours - searching through spreadsheets resembling what was submitted to us. (See paragraph 16 above). It is also hard to see how simply looking through them could take them any further in finding the requested material. The vast majority lacked any data to cross-refer to and as the witness stated, there was no way of knowing whether or not any given file numbers related to one of the subjects requested. We must presume what we have seen is representative of the majority since this is what we were presented with and the MoJ provided them to the Appellant to show the difficulty they were in. 35. Despite our doubts in the MoJ’s approach to a cost estimate, we are satisfied that it would take an extremely long time to look through each archived paper file. Whilst it would not necessarily be the case that all of the files would have needed to be searched - depending on whether the information was found, say, in the middle or end of the search - it seems reasonable to conclude that searching a fraction of the extraordinary number of disordered files would go well beyond 24 hours. The Appellant seems to accept this, as she stated: “… it is difficult to see how there could be a reasonable chance of retrieving any specific information from them within the cost ceiling …” 36. However, the Appellant had asked whether relevant policy units working in the same areas as the information she requested might be able to trace the information. Likewise, she thought it might be possible to ask MoJ library what was held. Given that the MoJ were asked at the prehearing whether any electronic 19 EA/2011/0298searches had been made of MoJ’s own records (as opposed to those held in archive), we were surprised that this was never progressed. The Appellant had also asked whether the MoJ could have done a web-based search. If she meant a search of what material was publicly available online, they could not be required to do this.) 37. The witness stated that she had not conducted a search of MoJ’s own websites because this did not fall within her remit. Taking into account our understanding of the law10, such a response would appear to be veering towards the ‘going through the motions’ end of the scale of what a reasonable process for considering how to investigate whether the information is held and to be assessing it properly. It is better to look for a needle in a sewing kit than a haystack, even if one knows the sewing kit is very depleted. 38. The witness also stated that the policy units were not consulted because they could not have been in a position to suggest how to provide all the documents originally requested because both electronically and hardcopy manual files had been requested. Even if this were correct, the duty to advise and assist under s16 FOIA arguably requires the department to consider whether part of the request could be satisfied within the cost limit, as ordered by the Commissioner in his decision notice. 39. As to the Appellant’s arguments in paragraph 29, we agree with the Commissioner and Second Respondent that there is nothing in the legislation that can be construed to mean that if the records are poorly managed this precludes it from relying on section 12 FOIA. In our view, this would however heighten the need to consider any possible alternative places to look that might make the search quicker and more fruitful. Nothing in what the Appellant quoted from the Commissioner’s guidance or Parliamentary papers detracts from this view. Whilst it is up to an authority to decide whether to rely on the cost exemption so as not to provide information, it has a right to do so within the terms of the FOIA. Other Matters: 40. We note that we have found the MoJ’s approach in this case somewhat confusing. It informed the Appellant that some of the information requested was held. It is unclear how this conclusion was reached when it had not find any of the information requested. It also suggested to the Appellant she refine her request to bring it within the cost limit when its case was that it was not the scope of the request that was the issue but its own un-indexed records management systems. 41. Our decision is unanimous. Signed: Judge C Taylor 16 October 2012 10 See paragraph 12 above. 20 EA/2011/0298"
"241","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2012/0064 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50406303 Dated: 31 January 2012 Appellant: PETER MARSH Respondent: THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Heard at: Field House, Breams Building, London, EC4A 1DZ Date of hearing: 17 July 2012 Date of decision: 1 October 2012 Before CHRIS RYAN (Judge) and HENRY FITZHUGH MIKE JONES Attendances: The Appellant appeared in person. The Respondent did not attend and was not represented. Subject matter: Vexatious or repeated requests s.14 Cases: Independent Police Complaints Commission v Information Commissioner (EA/2011/0222).Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed and the Decision Notice dated 31 January 2012 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: Southwark Council Address: PO Box 64529 London SE1P 5LX The complainant’s request for information from the public authority dated 20 June 2011 was not vexatious and accordingly the public authority was not entitled to rely on section 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and should have responded to it pursuant to its obligation to do so under section 1(1). However, as the complainant now has the information he was seeking from the public authority it is not required to take any steps. REASONS FOR DECISION The request for information 1. On 20 June 2011 the Appellant (“Mr Marsh”) sent a request for information to the Southwark London Borough Council (“the Council”). The relevant part of the request read: “Follow-up requests to request #128625 Your letter of 07.04 stated inter alia that “the Council is currently reviewing the methodology for any increase in court costs. It is anticipated that this review will be complete with May and any increase approved by June. I now request (a) the outcome of such review, or, if it has not been completed, the expected date of completion, and (b) an explanation of any difference in methodology from that followed for the benefits costs benchmarking exercise.” We will refer to the request in (a) as “the Costs Review Request” and the request in (b) as “the Benchmarking Request”. We will refer to the request as a whole as “the Information Request”. 2Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 2. The Information Request was made under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), which imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. In this case the Council refused disclosure. Its reasons were set out in a letter dated 23 June 2011, which included this passage: “You have been in correspondence with the council for a significant period of time as well as making numerous Freedom of Information requests in relation to the court costs regarding Council Tax collection. In addition, we are also of the opinion that when the council answers a particular request this simply leads to you sending further correspondence and making further requests. Therefore whilst your current request is not vexatious in isolation it is the latest in a long series of overlapping requests and other correspondence and the council’s view is that it forms a wider pattern of behaviour that makes it vexatious.” On that basis the Council concluded that it was entitled to rely on FOIA section 14, the relevant part of which reads: “(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious.” 3. Mr Marsh asked the Council to undertake an internal review of its refusal, which it did. It wrote to Mr Marsh on 19 July 2011 maintaining its stance that it was entitled to refuse the Information Request under FOIA section 14. It relied on what it said was a long series of overlapping requests or other correspondence from Mr Marsh, which it felt formed “part of an extended campaign to expose alleged improper practices in relation to issues that either directly or indirectly linked to council tax”. The letter conceded that the Information Request did not impose a significant burden on the Council, that it was not designed to cause disruption or annoyance and that it did not lack any serious purpose or value. However, the Council then went on to explain why it considered that the Information Request could fairly be seen as obsessive and as being likely to have the effect, when considered in the context of earlier requests and correspondence dating back to 2006, of harassing the Council and causing distress to its staff. 3Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 The complaint to the Information Commissioner and his Decision Notice. 4. Mr Marsh complained to the Information Commissioner about the Council’s refusal to disclose the information he had requested. The Information Commissioner, after investigating the complaint, issued a Decision Notice on 31 January 2012 (“the Decision Notice”). In it he examined the circumstances surrounding the Information Request and considered whether, in context, it: a) Would create a significant burden on the Council in terms of expense and distraction; b) Was designed to disrupt or annoy; c) Had the effect of harassing the Council or its staff; d) Could fairly be characterised as obsessive or manifestly unreasonable; and e) Had any serious purpose or value. In the Council’s representations to the Information Commissioner it did not press factors a), b) or e). However, it did rely on the other factors. 5. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Information Request had the effect of harassing the Council or its staff (factor c) above), due to the volume and frequency of requests, even though the language used, although robust at times, was not in itself distressing. He also concluded that the Information Request was obsessive and manifestly unreasonable (factor d)), given the volume and frequency of correspondence received from Mr Marsh and the Council’s attempts to provide responses to earlier requests. The Information Commissioner took particular note of three arguments put to him by the Council. The first was that Mr Marsh tended to reopen issues dealt with in earlier correspondence and requests, with several requests often being contained in a particular communication. The second argument was that the same or similar issues that formed part of the Information Request had been raised by Mr Marsh when complaining to the District Auditor about the Council’s annual accounts for each of the years 2007/8, 2008/9, 2009/10 and 2010/11. The third and final argument was that the Council had been forced to expend considerable resources in dealing with Mr Marsh’s requests and other correspondence. 4Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 6. The Information Commissioner concluded that, primarily because of the volume of requests and the consequent use of Council resources in dealing with them, the Information Request was obsessive and manifestly unreasonable. He drew particular attention to the fact that the request stated that it was a follow-up to a previous request, the substance of which had been previously answered. He concluded: “…the request continues an established pattern of obsessive behaviour which, in its volume and frequency, harassed council staff. He is satisfied that the council’s previous efforts to comply with section 1 in relation to the complainant’s request/s had justifiably shifted to section 14(1) with regard to this particular request as it exemplified the complainant’s need to revisit matters that had become, by that stage, vexatious.” The appeal to this Tribunal 7. Mr Marsh appealed the Information Commissioner’s decision to this Tribunal. In his grounds of appeal he suggested that responding to the Information Request would have been relatively straightforward and argued that the Council’s failings in relation to the matters that concerned him (the recovery of court costs in claims for the recovery of council tax) had been established as a result of his previous attempts to uncover them and had been acknowledged by the District Auditor. He also challenged the Information Commissioner’s assessment of the history of information requests submitted to the Council and complaints addressed to the District Auditor. 8. The Notice of Appeal included a request that the matter be determined at a hearing, rather than on the papers. As an appellant has a right to a hearing, directions were given to enable a hearing to take place. This resulted in both the Information Commissioner’s Response and Mr Marsh’s Reply including their respective arguments and being accompanied by any documents relied on, so as to compress the pre-hearing procedures. In the event the Information Commissioner chose not to appear at the hearing but relied on his written submissions. Mr Marsh did appear. He argued his case and answered a number of questions put to him by the Tribunal. At our request he provided us, after the hearing, with a copy of a particular item of correspondence and further information about the sequence of communications between himself and the 5Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 Council. This was provided to the Information Commissioner who indicated that he did not wish to make any further submissions relating to it. 9. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 10. We propose, first, to deal with the Costs Review Request (paragraphs 11 to 32 below) and then the Benchmarking Request (paragraphs 33 to 35). The Costs Review Request 11. In light of the acceptance by the Council and Information Commissioner that a serious reason lay behind Mr Marsh’s requests and that he had not set out to disrupt the Council’s business or annoy its staff, the section 14 challenge relies heavily on the quantity of correspondence received from Mr Marsh, its subject matter and the period of time during which it was generated. In those circumstances we need to explore the whole history of the matter. The history of correspondence between Mr Marsh and the Council 12. In late 2006 Mr Marsh received a court summons, issued by the Council, claiming unpaid Council Tax. Added to the summons was a claim for fixed costs of £65. The documentation served on Mr Marsh also stated that a further £30 would be claimed if the summons was not complied with and the court issued a Liability Order. It subsequently became apparent that the summons had been issued in error. The claim for both tax and costs was withdrawn. 13. The incident led Mr Marsh on a train of enquiry about the way in which the Council’s costs claim had been calculated. He set out to discover whether fixed cost claims included in Council Tax summonses would result in the Council recovering too high a figure (to the detriment of defendants), or too low (to the 6Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 detriment of the general body of Council Tax payers). He therefore submitted a request under section 1 of the FOIA in December 2006 seeking information about how the costs had been computed and an explanation of why the Council considered that it was entitled to claim reimbursement of what it claimed to have incurred. He also added requests for information about the number of summonses issued and the number that had subsequently to be withdrawn due to errors by the Council or its agents. 14. Correspondence ensued between Mr Marsh and the Council, during which Mr Marsh pursued his earlier requests about the computation of costs claims, but also tried to set this in the context of the gross costs of the Council Tax Department. It is clear from the correspondence we have seen, as well as the Council’s own log of the complete chain of communications, that Mr Marsh suspected that an inflated costs figure was being added to each summons which, if paid, would have caused the Council to recover, not just the costs incurred in generating the summons and related work, but also some part of the otherwise unrecoverable overheads of the Council Tax Department. He also formed the view that the level of recovery actually achieved as the result of taking court action against Council Tax payers was surprisingly low. He therefore submitted a request for several additional pieces of information, apparently targeted at that issue. 15. It has to be said that the number of items of information requested was substantial and involved a good deal of quite detailed statistical and/or financial information. However, no question arose at that stage of the Council characterising any of the requests as vexatious. 16. We were not provided with the full history of correspondence between Mr Marsh and the Council, but it appears that in February 2007 the Deputy Leader of the Council intervened on Mr Marsh’s behalf, writing to the Council’s Chief Executive asking that the requests, which had not been responded to by that date, should be answered. Either as a result of that intervention, or for other reasons, there certainly appears to have been an attempt by the Council to discuss Mr Marsh’s concerns. The Council provided a written explanation of the rationale behind the fixed costs structure in November 2007 and appears to have adopted some of Mr Marsh’s suggestions for the re-drafting of the documentation used by the Council in respect of Council Tax summonses. At that stage the Council seems to have 7Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 been willing to concede that its approach to fixed cost recovery could be open to challenge, although it had been advised that it “would be able to present an argument that the level of costs [was] not unreasonable.” It indicated that the consideration the issue had received presented an opportunity for it to re-visit its approach with a view to quantifying the actual costs incurred and to demonstrating that the costs were reasonable. The Council indicated willingness at that stage to share with Mr Marsh its proposed new costs model. 17. A meeting between the parties then took place in February 2008 in an apparent attempt to explain the Council’s position and, presumably, to satisfy Mr Marsh on the issues that were causing him concern. The dialogue clearly extended beyond the simple issue of information release and developed into a debate about the Council’s cost-recovery procedures more generally. Mr Marsh asserted that in the course of that meeting the Council’s Finance Director went further than the earlier correspondence and conceded that the cost issue had not been dealt with properly. Mr Marsh was given information at the time which, while not satisfying him that all of his freedom of information requests had been satisfied, did lead him to believe that there were discrepancies in the recording of costs recovered and written off, and that tax recovery work may have taken up a disproportionate part of the total workload of the Council Tax Department (or, if not, that cost recoveries were subsidising the Department’s budget). He accordingly continued to pursue his enquiries in preparation for a further meeting which Council Officials had promised to schedule. However the Council initially postponed that follow up meeting and then, in a letter from its Chief Executive dated 16 July 2008, broke off further discussions, saying: “We do not believe as a Council we should spend valuable time and resources meeting and discussing this further as we are confident that if a measurement was used we are in no doubt that the costs exceed £62.” 18. The decision by the Council to discontinue the co-operation with Mr Marsh led him to escalate the issue by taking his concerns to both the Audit Commission and (through his Ward Councillor) the Council’s own Overview and Security Committee. 19. Mr Marsh’s reference to the Audit Commission took the form of a complaint that costs award claims recorded in the Council’s accounts had in fact been unlawful because they exceeded that which had been “reasonably incurred”. Although we 8Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 have, again, not been provided with the whole of the correspondence, we were provided with evidence that the Audit Commission gave the Council an opportunity to comment on Mr Marsh’s complaint. Those comments included an acknowledgement, as early as July 2009, that the fixed cost figure, although agreed with the London Forum of Magistrates’ Clerks in October 2005, had not been based on detailed calculations. 20. On 15 October 2008 the Overview and Security Committee considered a number of issues that troubled Mr Marsh including the following: a) The suggestion that the Council had misrepresented that a cost recovery of £62 on each summons represented its reasonable costs (for the purpose of the Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992), as it had not calculated the figure. It appears that the Council did not claim at this stage that any computation had been carried out, but argued that, as the courts appeared to be satisfied at the level of costs claimed, and as the figure was consistent with those claimed by other local authorities across the London area, it had acted properly. However, the Finance Director did tell the Committee that attempts were being made at that time to uncover reliable costs data from the London Forum of Magistrates Clerks and the group of local authorities deputed to seek agreement with the clerks (“The London Review Group”). Members of the Committee, including its chair, expressed some concern that costs charge should have been properly calculated. b) A complaint that the summons documentation was misleading, which the Council had already acknowledged and had, with the co-operation of the court, amended. c) Criticism of perceived inadequacies in the book-keeping, administration and financial reporting of council tax collection. The Council’s view was that Mr Marsh’s criticisms stemmed from a misunderstanding of the figures, but the Committee nevertheless decided not to initiate a scrutiny review into this aspect of the Council’s tax because, as a result of Mr Marsh’s complaint to the Audit Commission, that body was already carrying out an investigation. The Committee decided that it would review the situation when the outcome was known. 21. After the date when Mr Marsh took his complaint to those other bodies he continued to engage with the Council on the computation of costs claims and the 9Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 process of pursuing them. In February 2011 he followed up on a reference in the Council’s budget statement to an additional £1.3 million being secured by increasing Council Tax and business rates costs awards by 34% and 37.5% respectively. He asked for details of the computation of this amount and was informed that £0.5 million was expected to be obtained by increasing the amount of costs claimed and that the balance of £0.8 million was expected to come from increasing arrears collection. Mr Marsh told us that the Council subsequently informed him on 7 April 2011 that there was to be no increase in the unit amount of cost demands and that it held no further information about the £0.5 million. It also told him that the projected savings figure of £1.3 million remained achievable through increased recovery of arrears. On the same date it stated that: “…the Council is currently reviewing the methodology for any increase in court costs. It is anticipated that this review will be complete within May and any increase approved by June.” 22. Also in April 2011 Mr Marsh pressed the Council to justify the projected figures in the face of certain statistics that he clearly felt threw doubt on their reliability. The request was refused. By an email dated 20 May 2011 Mr Marsh continued to press the Council for more information to support its figures. His request was allocated four separate numbers, in order to avoid delay in the event that some of the items of information could be produced earlier than others. This caused an artificial increase in the number of information requests that Mr Marsh appeared to have submitted. One of the requests was complied with on 15 June 2011, by the Council providing Mr Marsh with a statement to the effect that court costs had been unchanged in the financial year 2010/11 from the previous financial year. The response also stated that, following changes to the arrangements for pursuing Council Tax arrears: “… no new computation will be made until we are able to assess the relevant costs of the reconfigured service. The Council is keen to review these costs as soon as practically possible although given current workloads within the new team this is unlikely to be until next year” 23. On 20 June 2011 Mr Marsh followed up on the Council’s statement, quoted above, that it expected to complete its review of court costs in May by submitting the Information Request. 10Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 24. We regard the communications summarised in paragraphs 12 to 23 above as representing a single line of enquiry pursued by Mr Marsh (“the Central Enquiry”). Over the same period of time he raised a number of other issues with the Council, which we will refer to as “the Peripheral Enquiries”. And, after the Information Request had been submitted, he continued to pursue other questions (“the Subsequent Enquiries”). As the Council and the Information Commissioner relied upon the volume of correspondence to support the case for refusing disclosure, we summarise the Peripheral Enquiries and the Subsequent Enquiries in the following paragraphs. 25. The Peripheral Enquiries: The communications that came into existence as part of the Peripheral Enquiries were the following: a) On 6 September 2009 Mr Marsh asked the Council for information on the mean average times taken for the preparation of council tax summonses. He explained to us that this was relevant to his continuing interest in monitoring the correlation between the fixed cost claim and actual costs incurred over a particular period, which had been released to him in previous years. However, on this occasion the Council refused disclosure. b) From time to time Mr Marsh asked the Council to update and/or clarify information he held on the number of summonses issued, and liability orders granted, each year. That information was released to him in August 2010, but a request for a later period was refused in 2011. c) Mr Marsh also arranged to inspect the Council’s accounts from time to time, no doubt so that he could consider whether it would be appropriate to make a complaint to the Audit Commission in respect of the particular year which the accounts covered. d) In July 2010 Mr Marsh asked for clarification of some of the data that had been given to him during the February 2008 meeting referred to in paragraph 17 above. 26. The Subsequent Enquiries comprised the following: a) Three requests on 20 June 2011 for the Council to respond to earlier requests falling within the scope of the Central Enquiry; and b) A request on 3 July 2011 for the Council to respond to another earlier request falling within the scope of the Central Enquiry. 11Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 Our conclusions on the application of FOIA section 14 to the Costs Review Request 27. The Information Commissioner referred to a decision of a differently constituted panel of this Tribunal in the case of Independent Police Complaints Commission v Information Commissioner (EA/2011/0222). It included this passage: “Abuse of the right to information under s.1 of FOIA is the most dangerous enemy of the continuing exercise of that right for legitimate purposes. It damages FOIA and the vital rights that it enacted in the public perception. In our view, the ICO and the Tribunal should have no hesitation in upholding public authorities which invoke s.14(1) in answer to grossly excessive or ill-intentioned requests …” The decision also stressed that the assessment of whether a request was vexatious should not be reduced to a process of assessing how many of the criteria summarised in paragraph 4 above had been satisfied since, for example: “…a request which by no means overwhelms the resources of the authority but which is clearly motivated merely by a desire to cause a nuisance may be judged vexatious without more.” And, a little later: “…a modest request, viewed against a long history of similar requests showing no obvious serious purpose in the requester may satisfy s.14, even where, seen in isolation, it would fall far short of doing so.” 28. Although we are not bound by other decisions of this Tribunal we think those remarks make very good sense. However, consideration must also be given to the subject matter of the information request under review, particularly where the persistence of its pursuit forms part of the grounds for invoking section 14. Put at its highest, the pursuit of information about serious wrongdoing by a public authority would justify a very great deal of persistence, including “drilling down”, in a series of requests, into the detail behind previous responses which may have been expressed in general terms. At the other end of the scale, even one follow up request might be regarded as vexatious if the subject matter is trivial. The difficulty which the Information Commissioner and Tribunal may sometimes face is that it is not entirely clear how important or trivial information is until it has been disclosed. 12Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 29. In this case Mr Marsh drew our attention to certain events, occurring after the Information Request had been refused, which throw some light on the subject matter and, as he put it to us, his justification for pursuing his enquiries. He produced correspondence showing that the Audit Commission’s ultimate conclusion, in respect of the Council’s 2009/10 and 2010/11 accounts, had been that, although no item of account was unlawful, there was scope for the Council to improve its arrangements for calculating and managing court costs and liability orders. It made certain recommendations to address many of the issues that concerned Mr Marsh. These were put to the Council and in February 2012 the Council notified the Audit Commission that: a) It intended to undertake a calculation of costs following the first year of a new method of operating, to be completed within the first quarter of 2012/2013; b) It would monitor the charges collected against the costs incurred in order to assess whether recovery was exceeding cost; c) It would make certain changes to its procedures in respect of liability orders; and d) It would make further reports to the Audit and Governance Committee from time to time. 30. We think it appropriate, and indeed necessary, for us to take into account this evidence because it reinforces our own view, having gone through with Mr Marsh the Council’s complete log of its communications with him, that the Central Enquiry was not vexatious. We have demonstrated, in the history summarised in paragraphs 12 to 23 above, how Mr Marsh pursued a legitimate concern on an issue of some significance, at first with a degree of co-operation from the Council and, when that was removed, by dogged, forensic investigation of the information the Council provided to him or to the public. It was a campaign that led the Council’s own Overview and Security Committee to investigate in 2008 and some of its members to express concern about the way in which cost claims appeared to have been assessed. There is also some suggestion that, having provided the public with a budgeted £0.5 million increase in costs recovery, which it was then unwilling or unable to justify when challenged by Mr Marsh, it simply refused to engage with him on the subject and issued a refusal notice (see paragraph 21 above). The issue under consideration was also a relatively complex one, involving detailed analysis of both the legal basis for a costs claim and the manner in which the Council treated the direct costs of Council Tax recovery and 13Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 its underlying overheads. This provides further justification for different strands of enquiry having been pursued in parallel and investigated in some depth. 31. We are satisfied that the Information Request falls within the logical line of investigation which we have traced through the Central Enquiry and that, as such, it was not vexatious. Whether or not requests falling within the Peripheral Enquiry or the Subsequent Enquiry might legitimately be characterised as vexatious is not an issue we need to address and we will say nothing on the subject because we understand that at least one of the requests might already be the subject of a challenge under FOIA section 14. However, we do need to consider whether the nature of those requests should influence our decision on the Information Request itself. Does a request which, for the reasons given, is not vexatious in its own right, become so because the person making it has also sent a number of other requests that have a connection with the same subject matter? We should say, at the outset, that we do not think that the pursuit, in parallel, of an inspection of the Council’s accounts, under an entirely separate right of public participation, carries any significant weight in making that assessment on the facts of this particular case. Nor do we attribute any significant weight to the fact that Mr Marsh, having been provided with certain information on cost claims in one year, should have asked for the equivalent information in respect of a later year. As to the other freedom of information requests, we have concluded, that although it is appropriate to take them into account, they do not have the effect of tainting the Central Enquiry with such a stain of vexatiousness that we should be led to conclude that section 14 applies. We conclude, therefore, that the Costs Review Request was not vexatious and that the Council was not therefore entitled to refuse to comply with it. 32. So that there should be no doubt on the point we stress that our decision relates to the Costs Review Request only. It should not be interpreted as approving, or expressing any view about, any of the requests falling outside the Central Enquiry or any requests Mr Marsh may make in the future on the same general topic. The Benchmarking Request 33. On 8 February 2011 Mr Marsh asked the Council for certain information about its participation in certain benchmarking exercises, including one conducted by the 14Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (“CIPFA”). On 24 March 2011 Mr Marsh chased the Council for a response to his request. He informed us that the Council informed him at some stage that the body that had organised the benchmarking exercise objected to disclosure. However, the only document we have seen setting out the Council’s grounds of objection is its letter of 23 June 2011, quoted in paragraph 2 above, which rejected both parts of the Information Request as being vexatious. 34. It is true that the Benchmarking Request arose out of the Costs Review Request and arguable whether it fell within the Central Enquiry or the Peripheral Enquiry. However, the issue is academic because, on the same day that the Council wrote to Mr Marsh rejecting the Information Request, a lawyer from its Governance Team wrote to him enclosing a copy of the Council’s submission to CIPFA. 35. Mr Marsh informed us that, although he had therefore received the information he had requested, he did not wish there to be a decision against him characterising either part of the Information Request as vexatious. Although the Information Commissioner did not address this particular aspect of the appeal in his written submission, we regard the Council as having, in effect, abandoned its section 14 argument in respect of the Benchmarking Request when it provided the information requested. Conclusion 36. For the reasons we have given we consider that neither element of the Information Request was vexatious and that the Council should therefore have complied with the Costs Review Request in the same way as it did in respect of the Benchmarking Request. 37. We should add that Mr Marsh informed us that he does now have all the information he was seeking under the Costs Review Request and accordingly we are not required to make any direction to the Council to make further disclosure to him under the Information Request. 38. Our decision is unanimous. 15Appeal No. EA/2012/0064 [Signed on original.] Chris Ryan Judge 1 October 2012 16"

SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated 17 September 2012 Public authority Bury Council Address of Public authority Town Hall Knowsley Street Bury BL9 0SW Name of Complainant Mr Ian Pringle The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Tribunal allows the appeal and substitutes the following decision notice in place of the decision notice dated 23 February 2012. Action Required The requested information should be supplied to the Appellant, subject to any relevant statutory exemptions, within 31 days of notice of this substituted Decision Notice. Robin Callender Smith Judge 17 September 2012 -3-REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. The Appellant belongs to a group called “Save Our Suite”. This group is concerned with the future of the Longfield Suite in Prestwich. The Longfield Suite is described in the Appellant’s witness statement dated 23 August 2012 as: ...the last grand statement by the then Prestwich Borough Council to provide a civic centre for the town. The Longfield Suite houses three War Memorials from the former Prestwich Town Hall and a separate dedicated Memorial Hall all of which are Registered War Memorials… ...a venue to promote the health and well-being of the local community and for dancing... the floor in the main hall is considered to be one of the finest in the North West. 2. On 11 April 2011 he made an 11-part information request to Bury Metropolitan Borough Council as follows: 1. A full copy of the existing, 12 month old Longfield Suite Business Plan & Marketing Strategy. 2. 2010 – 2011 Audit of accounts for the Longfield Suite including a full set of receipts for all bookings at the venue. 3. The objectives, strategies, targets and performance measures included in the existing Business Plan. The Suite’s role in improving the health and well-being of Bury residents in line with the national and local agenda on increasing physical activity, and how this contributes directly to achieving Team Bury’s corporate ambitions. 4. The strategies adopted/implemented to address any areas of unsatisfactory performance against the existing Business Plan. 5. The project team's terms of reference, showing key milestones such as deliverables, deadlines and dates for reporting progress and the proposed 12-month review by Bury MBC's management board. 6. An organisational chart showing which posts are responsible for implementing the existing Business Plan, including those based at the Suite and elsewhere in EDS. -4-7. The Suite’s previous business plan(s). 8. Progress (if any) against the action plan proposed in the 'Best Value Review of Civic Halls (Bury Venues) Service October 2007'. 9. A breakdown of where the Suite is regularly available but not being used (any time reserved for room preparation, catering and clearing up should be reflected in this). 10. An overview of which types of events offered at the Suite yield the most and least profit for Bury MBC after all relevant costs have been covered. 11. A breakdown of the Suite’s users by category (for example, how many/what kinds of people are using the Suite and for what purposes; how many residents or visitors; also which sections of the local community are under-represented among users). 3. On 13 May 2011 the Council refused that information request and relied on s.14 Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) on the basis that it was a vexatious request. 4. It stated that there had been numerous dealings with the “Save Our Suite” campaign and that the request had been considered to be one which imposed a significant burden in terms of expense and distraction, that was designed to cause disruption and annoyance lacked any serious purpose or value. 5. The Appellant sought an internal review. On 27 October 2011 the Council confirmed its previous reliance on s.14 FOIA. 6. On 26 June 2011 the Appellant complained under s.50 to the Information Commissioner and the Council responded to requests asked by him – in respect of the complaint – on 7 November 2011. 7. In the Decision Notice dated 23 February 2012 the following findings were made: -5-(1) That the Appellant's dealings with the Council ought to be considered alongside those of the Save our Suite campaign as a whole; (2) Moderate weight should be given to the Council's argument about the burden and distraction of staff; some weight should be given to its argument in relation to the historic financial burden, and a small amount of weight in relation to anticipated future burden; (3) Some weight should be given to the Council's argument that the request is excessive or manifestly unreasonable; (4) No weight should be given to the Council's argument that the request would have the effect of harassing the public authority or its staff; (5) Some weight should be given to the Council's argument that part 2 of the request was designed to cause disruption and annoyance; (6) The purpose pursued by the Save our Suite campaign group was not sufficiently serious to outweigh the other factors identified; (7) Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the factors identified is that the Council correctly refused the Appellants request as vexatious. 8. The Appellant appealed against that Decision Notice. 9. Both Respondents, in their responses, observe that the grounds of appeal lack clarity or precision. 10. Bury Council, in its response, relies on the fact that a public authority, in assessing whether or not a decision is vexatious, can take into account all the facts – including any previous history of contact between it and the Appellant – in arriving at its conclusion. It states that it is clear that the Appellant is part of a group which has persistently requested information by using a number of avenues over a sustained period. 11. In particular (at Paragraph 18 of its Response) it states: Members of the organisation identifying themselves under the banner of “The Save Our Suite Campaign Group” have repeatedly made requests for the business plans relating to the Longfield Suite. These are set out below for ease of reference: -6-<U+F0B7> May 2010 – J Grosskopf a member of the group submitted an FOI request for the “business plans and assumptions”; <U+F0B7> July 2010 – Alf Wentworth in a letter to the Chief Executive asks “When can we expect to see any evidence of a new business plan?”; <U+F0B7> November 2010 – Alf Wentworth emailed the counsellor in the following terms “The Longfield Suite SOS group, of which I am a member, have tried since March to have sight of the Longfield Suite’s business plan….”; <U+F0B7> At a council meeting in December 2010 Christine Hodges a member of the same group submitted a public question: “…. Can we at the Save Our Suite Group receive a copy of the Longfield Suite’s Business Plan?”; <U+F0B7> May 2011 – Alf Wentworth & Kevin Hodges wrote to the Council’s chief executive raising a variety of issues including the business plan. 12. Bury Council present that as a “snapshot” of the repeated and excessive requests from SOS to the authority over a period from 2009 – 2011. Those requests had caused disruption of, and duplication to the Council’s finite resources. In Bury Council’s view the requests could be seen as excessive and they had and continued to harass the authority and cause distress to the staff, as the group “calls into question not only the competency of the staff but their experience and qualifications”. 13. The Appellant, in his response, maintains that his identity has been “retrospectively conflated” so that he is associated with a series of lawful activities carried out by other individuals and campaign groups not connected with him. 14. He states that his initial and only FOIA request of 11 April 2011 was written in a standard letter using his private address and details. There was no reference to the Save Our Suite Group. The electronic method of delivery should not be used as an argument to deny his basic human rights as an individual to request information. Rhetorically he posed the question about whether he should be discriminated against for being a member of the group. 15. He maintains that the issues in the appeal are between him and the Council and not the SOS Group and the Council. He also claims – specifically – that the Council has made factual errors in associating other named individuals with the SOS Group. -7-Evidence 16. At the oral hearing of this appeal in Manchester on 23 August 2012 Mr Pringle adopted his written witness statement, signed at court, and additional evidence was similarly offered by Mr Alf Wentworth. There was a written character reference in respect of Mr Ian Pringle submitted in person by Ms Dorothy Fletcher JP BA and a summary of the points the Appellant wished to make prepared by his McKenzie Friend for the purposes of this appeal, Mr Kevin Hodges. The relevant factual and evidential points arising out of this material are covered below in the Tribunal’s decision. Conclusion and remedy 17. All the parties will be aware that this matter was considered for striking out and allowed to proceed to a full appeal hearing by the Tribunal Judge in a ruling dated 11 July 2012. 18. The Tribunal could see that, in the chronology of this matter, there had been an attempt by Bury Council to seek “critical friends” – following a press statement on 4 March 2010 - within the local community as it embarked on consideration of plans relating to the Longfield Suite. 19. This open approach appears to have narrowed rather rapidly when individuals, and groups like Save Our Suite, took the Council at its word and sought to provide inputs that were sometimes critical and potentially time- consuming in terms of requiring reasoned responses. 20. Bury Council’s position is that Mr Pringle was not just making an individual information request but was also representative of a volume of information requests, mainly generated by the Save Our Suite campaign, that it was having to deal with. 21. What the Council does not seem to have done is to consider inviting Mr Pringle to narrow and focus his request (the subject of this appeal) so that it might consider dealing with it in a more effective way and one that would be less onerous in terms of staff time and resources. -8-22. On the specific facts of this case while the request in question is a lengthy series of questions – which we consider could have been narrowed without losing their purpose – we have to bear in mind that it is the one and only one generated by the Appellant. He makes this request as an individual but does not disguise the fact that he is a member and supporter of the Save Our Suite campaign. 23. Appeals such as this involve, of necessity, the exercise of judgement in terms of practicality and proportionality. We find that Bury Council, and the Commissioner, were too keen to aggregate this request by an individual into parallel activity by the campaign group of which he was a part without considering whether there were elements – if the request itself was reduced in scope – that could rightly and properly be dealt with or (on the other hand) resisted by way of any other relevant exemptions that might be appropriate. 24. This was his first and only request. It was sent in a standard letter from his personal email address. In the scale of things this did not amount to the kind of email bombardment of a public authority seen, for example, in Duke v IC & University of Salford (EA/2011/0060). 25. We note that Bury Council, as part of its claim of vexatiousness, included the impact of questions submitted at public council meetings, to the Audit Commission and to a local Member of Parliament. It seems to us that whilst such enquiries may indeed result in a draw on resources, these are legitimate avenues of enquiry, outside of the Freedom of Information Act and necessary in a democratic society. 26. In our opinion, the sustained pursuit of a matter of such importance to the local community via such avenues should not lightly be characterised as a vexatious campaign, particularly in the context of the Council’s request for “critical friends”. 27. For all these reasons we find, unanimously, that his request should not immediately have met the s.14 FOIA refusal that it did and, as a result, we have issued a substituted Decision Notice. -9-28. There is no order as to costs. [Signed on the original] Robin Callender Smith Judge 17 September 2012 - 10 -"

We have decided that some parts of the Department for Education’s materials relating to two schools projects in which the United Learning Trust was involved should be disclosed. The Department had relied on exemptions under sections 36 (prejudice to the conduct of public affairs) and 42 (legal professional privilege) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in respect of those materials and the Information Commissioner had concluded that it had been entitled to refuse to disclose the information requested by the Appellant under those exemptions. Having ourselves inspected the withheld information, we have concluded that section 36 was engaged and that, although the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure in respect of most of the documents concerned, there were some (identified in a confidential annex) in respect of which it did not. As regards section 42 we have concluded that some of the documents did not fall within the scope of the exemption (they are also identified in a confidential annex) but that the rest did and, in respect of those documents, the public interest in maintaining the exemption did outweigh the public interest in disclosure. 2EA/2011/0151; Decision The information request and complaint to the Information Commissioner. 2. The appeal arises out of an information request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), which was submitted by the Appellant to the Department for Education (previously the Department for Children, Schools and Families), (“the Department”) on 25 May 2010. It requested documents relating to the United Learning Trust (“ULT”) and its associated companies, the United Church Schools Trust and United Church Schools Foundation, in the period October 1 2009 to December 24 2009 as well as minutes of meetings and correspondence with Oxford and Northamptonshire councils that related to ULT over the same period and “details of any finance provided to ULT or its associated companies in respect of two academies planned for Oxford and Northampton”. 3. The broad effect of FOIA sections 1 and 2 is that a public authority has an obligation to disclose information that is requested from it unless the requested information is covered by one of the exemptions set out in Part II of FOIA. If it is covered by an exemption that is categorised as a qualified exemption then the information may still have to be disclosed unless (FOIA section 2(2)(b)) “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 4. The background to the request is that ULT is an organisation which runs a number of educational establishments, including academies that were set up under a programme introduced by the previous Labour administration and continued under the present coalition government. The programme enables non-governmental organisations to establish and manage schools and to receive financial support for that activity from the government. In December 2009 ULT announced that it was to withdraw from two such projects (Weston Favell Academy in Northamptonshire and Oxford School). The Appellant, who is a journalist specialising in educational matters, was concerned that, as ULT did not in her view have a good record in turning round failing 3EA/2011/0151; Decision schools, there ought to be transparency as to how and why it was first selected as the potential sponsor for these two projects and then why it withdrew. 5. The Appellant was not happy that, although some information was disclosed in response to her information request, other information was withheld. She therefore complained to the Information Commissioner who carried out an investigation. The outcome of that investigation was recorded in a Decision Notice dated 29 June 2011 in which the Information Commissioner decided that, although some of the withheld information should be disclosed, the remainder should not because it was exempt from disclosure under FOIA sections 36 (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs), 40(2) (personal information of a third party) and 42 (legal professional privilege). The Appeal 6. The Appellant appealed to this Tribunal challenging just the sections 36 and 42 conclusions. Each of those sections, when applied to the facts of this case, creates a qualified exemption. 7. The relevant part of section 36 reads: “(1) This section applies to— (a) information which is held by a government department or by the Welsh Assembly Government and is not exempt information by virtue of section 35, and (b) … (2)Information to which this section applies is exempt information if, in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person, disclosure of the information under this Act— (a) … (b) would, or would be likely to, inhibit— (i) the free and frank provision of advice, or (ii) the free and frank exchange of views for the purposes of deliberation, or 4EA/2011/0151; Decision (c) would otherwise prejudice, or would be likely otherwise to prejudice, the effective conduct of public affairs.” 8. In the present case the Department relied on subsections (2)(b)(i) and (ii) and 2(c). The Appellant did not deny that, in the particular circumstances of this case (as it relates to papers of a previous administration), the Attorney General was the “qualified person” and therefore entitled to express the opinion on which the Department relied. Nor did the Appellant raise a specific challenge to the reasonableness of that opinion. She argued forcibly that the withheld information should have been disclosed, because of what she considered was an overwhelming public interest in decisions that had a serious impact on many people (including pupils and future pupils of the schools in question, as well as their parents) and involved heavy expenditure of public funds. However, we have not treated those arguments as challenging the reasonableness of the opinion, but have proceeded on the basis that, the exemption having been engaged, we should take them into account when addressing the public interest balance which we are required to consider under FOIA section 2(2)(b) (see paragraph 3 above). 9. The relevant part of section 42 reads: “(1) Information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege … could be maintained in legal proceedings is exempt information.” The Appellant asserted that relations between ULT and the Department would be governed by legal agreements and speculated that the Department would have had to take account of its obligations under those agreements before taking the actions which, she believed, led ULT to withdraw from the projects in question. She argued that it was in the public interest that the contracts themselves, as well as legal advice in relation to their effect, should be made available for public scrutiny. The essence of her case in this respect was, therefore, again 5EA/2011/0151; Decision that the exemption was engaged but that the public interest in maintaining it did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. 10. The withheld information was made available to us in a closed bundle. For obvious reasons the contents of that bundle could not be made available to the Appellant (as to do so would effectively pre-judge the appeal) and we were forced to hold part of the hearing in closed session, so that we could discuss the detail of the withheld information with those representing the Information Commissioner. 11. We will deal in turn with each of the exemptions relied on. FOIA section 36 12. The closed bundle contained a copy of every document for which exemption was claimed, separated into different sections, depending on whether the exemption claimed was a. perceived inhibition of free and frank advice (subsection (2)(b)(i)) or free and frank exchange of views for the purposes of deliberation (subsection (2)(b)(ii)); or b. perceived prejudice of effective conduct of public affairs (subsection (2)(c)). (There was a separate section in the bundle containing materials to which, it was said, FOIA section 42 applies: we will come to those materials later in this decision.) 13. We reviewed each document by reference to the points made by the parties in open session, as supplemented in some cases by the Information Commissioner in closed session. We were satisfied in each case that the exemption had been correctly invoked and accordingly concentrated on assessing the public interest balance under FOIA section 2(2)(b). 14. The Appellant drew attention to the importance of the two projects and to the unsatisfactory manner in which they appear to have been 6EA/2011/0151; Decision handled by the Department. She asserted (sometimes on the basis of sound evidence, but occasionally on the basis of second hand information, or even speculation) that ULT had first been imposed on the relevant local education authority by the Department, then maintained as sponsor despite publication of a report criticising its performance at another of its schools and finally forced, or at least encouraged, to withdraw. That background justified greater transparency in respect of the manner in which the Department dealt with the matter and the advice it received at the time. This was particularly so because of the vulnerability of the schools in question and the grave difficulties they may have faced when the two projects collapsed. 15. The Information Commissioner argued that the value to the public of disclosure was significantly less in the case of documents recording the implementation of policy than it would have been had the case concerned the formulation of such policy. The fact that the information request was not submitted until some months after ULT withdrew meant that the information requested did not concern a live project at the time. By that time one of the schools had acquired a new sponsor and, in the other case, the local education authority had abandoned plans to convert the school to an academy. 16. The Appellant challenged whether either advice or deliberation would, or should, be inhibited by disclosure, given the expectation that civil servants would not allow the possibility of a freedom of information disclosure to deter them from their duty to proffer candid advice and debate it in robust dialogue. In response to the suggestion that disclosure at the date of the information request would have been premature, she pointed out that the value of having information available to the public may also be diluted by the passage of time. 17. The Appellant challenged the suggestion that the conduct of public affairs would be damaged by disclosure, undermining the relationships between, on the one hand, the Department and, on the other local 7EA/2011/0151; Decision education authorities or potential sponsors. She suggested that, in respect of those involved in the two projects under consideration, the harm had already been done by the time of her request and that future sponsors would be aware, in any event, of the public scrutiny that is bound to follow if they choose to enter into partnerships with central or local government. 18. The difficulty the Appellant faces in this case is that it became apparent to us when studying the closed bundle that it contained very little that threw light on the issues to which she drew our attention. This may have been the result of the period of time to which the information request applied (October to December 2009). It covered only a relatively short period leading up to ULT’s withdrawal. However, the Appellant explained to us that she wished to press her case for disclosure of information relating to ULT’s original appointment, because it was possible that material created during the later period referred to issues affecting the original appointment. Unfortunately, for the successful outcome of her appeal, it generally did not. Except as mentioned below, its focus was almost entirely on the events that were taking place at the time, or were anticipated for the future. It might nevertheless have disclosed matter that the public would have an interest to know, particularly in view of the concern expressed about ULT’s withdrawal. We carefully reviewed it in that context and also considered the possibility that it might throw light on the events surrounding ULT’s appointment. 19. When considering whether any document in the closed bundle might be relevant to the public interest factors identified by the Appellant we weighed in the balance the disadvantages that the Information Commissioner said would result from disclosure. These included: a. the inhibition on civil servants providing firm advice and support in the future; b. the need for decision-makers to be able to discuss all options; and 8EA/2011/0151; Decision c. the potential harm disclosure could cause to relationships between the Department, on the one hand, and local education authorities or sponsors. The Information Commissioner urged us to conclude that, while there was certainly a public interest in furthering understanding of what had happened with the two projects in question, and in increasing public confidence in the Department’s decision-making, he had been correct to reach the conclusion he did in his Decision Notice. 20. Against that background we considered that the public interest in maintaining the exemption relied on outweighed the public interest in disclosing most of the withheld information, largely because these documents did not address the particular issues with which the Appellant was concerned. However, in the case of a few documents we considered that the application of the public interest test should lead to an order to disclose. This was because they had a direct bearing on the Department’s decision-making processes during the last three months of 2009. In September of that year the Department complained to ULT about its record of success, yet in November it issued a public statement of support just a few weeks before ULT withdrew from the two projects, allegedly under pressure to do so from the Department. 21. We have set out in confidential annex 1 the identification of the documents in the closed bundle which we believe should, for these reasons, be disclosed. Where appropriate we have supplemented the reasons set out above in terms that would not be appropriate in this open part of our decision. Annex I should remain confidential until either the date for appealing this decision has expired and no appeal has been launched or, in the event that such an appeal is launched, the appeal has either been disposed of by the Upper Tribunal or withdrawn. 9EA/2011/0151; Decision FOIA section 42 22. As mentioned above, the Appellant did not challenge the categorisation of information as falling within the scope of this exemption. However, it seemed to us, when reviewing the closed bundle, that some of the documents ought not to attract legal professional privilege. We have identified those documents in Confidential Annex II to this decision. That annex should remain confidential until either the date for appealing this decision has expired and no appeal has been launched or, in the event that such an appeal is launched, the appeal has either been disposed of by the Upper Tribunal or withdrawn. 23. As to the remainder of the documents for which section 42 exemption was claimed we accept that the exemption applies and accordingly turn to consider the public interest balance, as it applies to their detailed content. 24. The Appellant argued that there was no question of legal advice having been sought in respect of litigation and that this reduced the public interest in maintaining the exemption. She said that there was no question, either, of the disclosure of advice on one sponsor’s contract having implications for other sponsor contracts, since each one would be tailored to the specific circumstances of the project being undertaken. Moreover, the information request was not submitted until some months after ULT withdrew from the two projects. On the other side of the balance, the Appellant said, lay the strong public interest in knowing what legal advice had been given in relation to the events that led to ULT’s withdrawal from the two projects in question, particularly by reference to contracts which had been entered into with ULT previously. She pointed out that the relationship with any academy sponsor is governed by a binding contract and that, Government Ministers having expressed concern about ULT’s record in September 2009, it was not until December of that year that ULT withdrew. In those circumstances, she argued, greater transparency was required in 10EA/2011/0151; Decision respect of the whole process which led to the cancellation of the contract, including the legal advice the Department received as to its contractual rights and obligations. 25. The Information Commissioner argued that the public interest was clearly in favour of maintaining the exemption. He accepted that the academy programme affected a large number of people and that ULT had received substantial public funds for a feasibility plan in respect of its plans before it withdrew from the project. He also accepted that there would be some weight in favour of disclosure if it would create greater understanding of the legal issues than the public already had from public domain sources. Against that the Information Commissioner argued that the two projects were still live issues at the time of the information request, as was the academy programme as a whole. 26. The Information Commissioner also invited us to consider, on the basis of our inspection of the closed bundle, whether the material withheld under this exemption really would have the effect on public awareness and knowledge that the Appellant anticipated. We are clear that it would not. It is sufficient to say, in this open decision, that, whatever the position might have been had the Appellant requested information created during a different period of time (on which we have no knowledge), the material in the closed bundle falling within the section 42 exemption would not materially increase public knowledge on the issues she identified, or on any other issue of sufficient significance to set against the public interest in protecting legal professional privilege. Conclusion 27. In the light of the findings we have recorded above we conclude that, apart from the documents identified in Annexes I and II, the Information Commissioner was right to reach the conclusion that he did. We direct 11EA/2011/0151; Decision that the Department release to the Appellant the documents listed in those two annexes within 35 days of the date of this determination. 28. Our decision is unanimous. [Signed on original] Chris Ryan Judge 5th March 2012 12CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX I That annex should remain confidential until either the date for appealing this decision has expired and no appeal has been launched or, in the event that such an appeal is launched, the appeal has either been disposed of by the Upper Tribunal or withdrawn. In the table below we identify documents falling within the exemption provided by FOIA section 36, but in respect of which we consider that the public interest in maintaining the exemption does not outweigh the public interest in disclosing the information. The documents should therefore be disclosed to the Appellant, except to the extent that any part of them may fall within another claimed exemption, which is either not challenged by the Appellant on this appeal, or in respect of which her challenge has not succeeded. Tabs B and D, section 36(2)(b)(i) (free and frank advice), or (ii) (free and frank exchange of views) B3. Email string between The memo at B85-87 was attached to this email and the 22 and 23 October 2009 comments in respect of B85-87 (see below) therefore apply to this document also. B85 –87. Memo dated 22 The memo seeks ministerial approval from Vernon Coaker October 2009 (the Minister of State for Schools and Learners at the time) to release feasibility funding to ULT for the establishment of an academy which would replace Oxford School and would be sponsored by ULT and co-sponsored by Oxfordshire County Council. The public interest in disclosure lies in the timing of the document and the light it throws on the decision-making process within the Department. The Appellant relies on the timing of: (a) a letter the Education Secretary, Ed Balls, wrote to ULT in September 2009 expressing concern at its performance; (b) a letter written by Vernon Coaker to the two LEAs concerned in November 2009 stating that the Department considered ULT to be a suitable sponsor; and (c) ULT’s withdrawal in December 2009. The document falls within the same period of time and we consider that the resulting public interest in its disclosure is at least equal to the public interest in maintaining the exemption and that it should therefore be disclosed. B19-20. Email from the It is questionable whether FOIA section 36(2)(b)(i) or (ii) office of Vernon Coaker to should properly have been invoked in respect of a Andrew Smith MP dated communication between a Minister and an MP in whose 12 November 2009 (with constituency the proposed new Oxford School would have the name and address of been located.

It was written just a few weeks before ULT’s withdrawal and accordingly merits disclosure onthe basis that the negative impact on advice and deliberations within the Department seems likely to be low and does not outweigh the public interest in seeing how the Minister’s decision-making process compared with information the Department was giving to outsiders at the time. B57 – 71. A briefing Although the document contains some advice to a Minister, of paper for the Secretary a very general nature concerning topics that might be avoided State’s meeting with ULT during the proposed meeting, it is for the most part a series of scheduled for 14 October factual statements and an appraisal of ULT’s performance. It 2009 (exemption being was written just a few weeks before ULT’s withdrawal and claimed under this heading accordingly merits disclosure on the basis that the negative only in relation to pages 12 impact on advice and deliberations within the Department and 13 of the document seems likely to be low and does not outweigh the public (B68 and 69 in the interest in seeing how the Minister’s decision-making process bundle)) compared with information and assessments being shared within the Department at the time. B82 and 83. Part of a We think it questionable whether the document as a whole is memorandum headed “out of scope” given the terms of the original request, which “Sheffield Park Academy: refer to ULT generally at the outset, before narrowing the Ofsted Monitoring Report” scope down to the two projects in Oxford and Northampton. (the rest being said to be However, we are satisfied that the rest of the document does “out of scope”), contain significant advice on how to handle the relationship with ULP. The part under consideration contains no advice but simply records certain facts about negative press comments attracted by ULT and communications between ULT and the Department regarding the role it should play in the future. It also records that the minister wrote to the relevant LEAs on 5 November 2009 confirming that he still believed that ULT was a suitable sponsor and we believe that the public interest in seeing those statements, in the context of the Department’s decision-making at the time, is at least equal to the public interest in maintaining the exemption. D9 -10 and D25 - 29. Two These communications passed between the Department and email strings between a ULT’s affiliate just days before ULT withdrew. Apart from member of the the last two emails in the string (recorded as having been Department’s Delivery transmitted at 26 November 2009 07:29 and 26 November Unit for New Academies 2009 10:34 respectively) we could see no significant advice or Division and an individual deliberation recorded in the documents. We believe that for at church-schools.com (an this reason (and on the basis that the two emails we have affiliate of ULT) dated identified are redacted) the public interest in maintaining the between late November exemption does not outweigh the public interest the Appellant and mid-December 2009. identified in the disclosure of information on certain aspects of the projects in question.

They do not record advice or “City of Oxford Academy deliberations. There is public interest in seeing this sort of Project” and a Feasibility material so close to the date when ULT withdrew, which is at Stage timeline. least equal to the public interest in maintaining the exemption. Tab E – section 36(2)(c) – prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. E3 – E5. An email string The emails show the Secretary of State’s office seekingon 6 October 2009 background information on a press report (suggesting that the governors of the Oxford School were in dispute with one another and with Oxfordshire County Council) and, after this has been provided, asking for background information on “the brokering of Academy status with ULT” and specifically “was it the LEA and ULT that approached DCSF with the proposal?” The response discloses that the Office for Schools Commissioner had approached ULT and that the LEA had then met ULT. It does go back to the facts of first appointment and is fact finding only. Exemption is claimed under the “effective conduct of public affairs” exemption but we believe that it should be disclosed on the basis that it was relevant to the public interest factors on which the Appellant relied and that this was at least equal to the negative impact on relationships with third parties (which was the basis of the prejudice relied on). We were told that the “advice to Ministers” referred to in paragraph 1 of the last email in the string had been disclosed earlier. E21 – 24 Notes This is a set of notes on a report (which we were told had previously been disclosed to the Appellant). It contains what the Information Commissioner referred to as “frank comment” (e.g. “ULT overstretched and not delivering”) but we have decided that the public interest in retaining secrecy over this material by asserting an exemption based on prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs did not outweigh the public interest in the assessment of ULT being disclosed. E27. Note of ULT termly This is a purely factual document that records a meeting with review meeting on 23 July ULT. We consider any damage to relations with ULT (the 2009. basis put forward in support of this exemption) would be quite limited and does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure relied on by the Appellant. E29. Briefing for ULT The same reasons for requiring disclosure apply to this termly review meeting on document as to E27 above.

The West Yorkshire Police wrongly identified the information requested and did not comply with the requirements under section 1(1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to inform the requestor whether it holds the information requested and, if so, to communicate it to him. SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated 9th February 2012 Public authority: West Yorkshire Police Address of Public authority: Police Headquarters Laburnum Road Wakefield WF1 3QP The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the substituted decision is that the West Yorkshire Police did not deal with the request in accordance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. 2EA/2011/0170; Decision Action Required The West Yorkshire Police must now consider the request of 9 June 2010 in accordance with the requirements of section 1(1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and either disclose to the Requestor the Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP service entitled Managing Crime in Prisons referred to in its letter to the Appellant dated 23 December 2009 or issue a refusal notice in accordance with section 17 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The West Yorkshire Police must do so within 20 working days from the date of this Substituted Decision Notice. Dated this 9th February 2012 Signed: Annabel Pilling Judge Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This is an Appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the ‘Commissioner’) dated 21 June 2011. The Decision Notice relates to a request for information made to the West Yorkshire Police (‘WYP’) under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ‘FOIA’). 2. On 9 June 2010, the Appellant wrote to the WYP: “Further to previous correspondence, please forward to me a copy of the document you have cited “Managing Crime in prisons.” 3EA/2011/0170; Decision 3. The WYP, after consultation with the Ministry of Justice (‘MoJ’), disclosed to the Appellant version 3.1 of a draft document from the Police Advisers Section to Her Majesty’s Prison Service, the Operation Guidance Document with the title “Managing Crime in Prisons”. Some information was redacted from the document. 4. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who concluded that the WYP correctly withheld the redacted information by virtue of section 31 of FOIA on the basis that disclosure would be likely to prejudice certain specified law enforcement matters and that, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. The Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal on 29 July 2011. The Tribunal joined the WYP and MoJ as Respondents. 6. The Appeal has been determined without a hearing on the basis of written submissions and an agreed bundle of documents 7. In addition, the Tribunal was provided with a closed bundle of documents. This bundle included an unredacted version of the draft Police Advisers Section Operation Guidance Document. We have considered all the material placed before us. The Powers of the Tribunal 8. The Tribunal’s powers in relation to appeals under section 57 of the FOIA are set out in section 58 of the FOIA, as follows: (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers- 4EA/2011/0170; Decision (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 9. The starting point for the Tribunal is the Decision Notice of the Commissioner but the Tribunal also receives and hears evidence, which is not limited to the material that was before the Commissioner. The Tribunal, having considered the evidence (and it is not bound by strict rules of evidence), may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner and consider the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law because of those different facts. Nevertheless, if the facts are not in dispute, the Tribunal must consider whether FOIA has been applied correctly. If the facts are decided differently by the Tribunal, or the Tribunal comes to a different conclusion based on the same facts, that will involve a finding that the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. Our Analysis 10. The Appellant appeals against the Commissioner’s Decision Notice; he is unrepresented and has been hampered in the preparation of this appeal by his personal circumstances. Although broad grounds of appeal had been identified from the Appellant’s original Notice of Appeal document, and submissions have been received addressing those grounds, the lack of logic in the arguments presented by the Respondents in this appeal has caused us to commence with a 5EA/2011/0170; Decision consideration of the original request for information to ascertain for ourselves what has led to this position. 11. The original request for information was made by the Appellant to the WYP by letter dated 9 June 2010. The letter was headed “Re: Investigations by you (regarding IPCC1 instructions)” and was made in the context of a complaint being pursued by the Appellant in respect of the response of the WYP in dealing with allegations of assault on him whilst in a prison: “Further to previous correspondence, please forward to me a copy of the document you have cited “Managing Crime in prisons.” 12. Within the agreed bundle of documents is the letter from WYP to the Appellant referring to that document. This letter is dated 29 December 2009 and contains the explanation for why the WYP did not instigate an investigation in relation to the Appellant’s allegations. The WYP explained that such matters are for the initial consideration of HMP Management in the first instance and that the police will only become involved at the request of HMP Management: “This is in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP service2 titled Managing Crime in Prisons.” 13. It is clear from this letter that WYP cited this document as being the basis upon which it had not investigated the allegations made by the Appellant. This Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP Service is the agreed policy to follow in respect of allegations of crime committed in prisons. The Appellant sought a copy of that document in order to pursue a claim against the WYP and/or prison service. 14. In our opinion the WYP did not consider the Appellant’s request properly and has misidentified the information requested. The information identified by the WYP was merely an operational guidance note drafted for a consultation exercise in 2008 – 1 The Independent Police Complaints Commission. 2 Her Majesty’s Prison Service 6EA/2011/0170; Decision 2009 and neither ACPO3 nor HMP Service were signed up to this document. It is clear from the Appellant’s original request and subsequent submissions, including references to the “MoU”, that he wanted the document relied upon by the WYP as justification for the stance it had taken in respect of his complaint about the way in which his allegations of assault had been dealt, namely the Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP service titled Managing Crime in Prisons. 15. Throughout dealing with this matter the WYP, the MoJ, and the Commissioner have failed to consider the initial request but have perpetuated the original error. The MoJ is clearly perplexed how the draft operational guidance document came to be identified by the Appellant. The answer to this is that it never did; the Appellant requested the Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP service titled Managing Crime in Prisons and it was the WYP which located a document with a similar title, providing a redacted version to the Appellant ultimately resulting in this appeal. 16. As the MoJ observes in its written submissions, the Appellant’s grounds of appeal are predicated on the assumption that the information requested represents the policy in operation within the prison estate regarding referral of matters to the police. That assumption is correct insofar as it relates to the information requested as opposed to the information eventually provided by the WYP. The information disclosed by the WYP has no relevance or bearing on the Appellant’s complaint about the stance taken in respect of his allegations of assault, unlike the information requested in his letter of 9 June 2010. 17. In the Decision Notice the Commissioner refers to the requested information as being ““Managing Crime in Prisons”, a draft operational guidance document written by the Police Advisors Section to HMP Service”. This was the disclosed information but was not the information clearly identified by the Appellant in his request. It follows that the Decision Notice is wrong in law and we therefore substitute the Decision Notice above. 3 The Association of Chief Police Officers 7EA/2011/0170; Decision 18. The WYP must now consider the request for information as identified by the Appellant in his request of 9 June 2010 and disclose the Memorandum of Understanding between the Police and HMP service titled Managing Crime in Prisons to him or issue a refusal notice in accordance with section 17 of FOIA. 19. Our decision is unanimous. Observation 20. The expected focus of this appeal was the information which had been redacted from the operational guidance note provided to the Appellant on the basis that disclosure would be likely to prejudice certain specified law enforcement matters under section 31 of FOIA, and that in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. Although we do not have to consider this in light of our finding above, we note that the majority of that information is already in the public domain, particularly as it is mostly contained in Annex C to PSO 2000 Prison Discipline Manual Adjudications. This PSO was not provided directly to the Tribunal despite being referred to by the Ministry of Justice. It seems to us that any serious analysis of the operational guidance note should have begun with a comparison of its content with the PSO 2000 which is available in all prison libraries. We note that no such comparison was conducted by any of the respondents and we further note that it would be difficult to sustain the argument that disclosure of information already in the public domain that was contained within a draft consultation document with no legal standing would be likely to prejudice those factors listed from section 31 of FOIA.

Action Required The Governing Body of Buckinghamshire New University is to respond to the enquiries submitted by Mr Benson and described as Requests 1-4 in the Decision Notice of 19 January 2011 by 28 October 2011. Dated this 28th day of September 2011 Signed Angus Hamilton DJ(MC) Judge -3-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Under section 1(1) of FOIA a person who has made a request to a public authority for information is, subject to other provisions of FOIA: (1) entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request (section 1(1)(a)); and (2) if the public authority does hold the information, to have that information communicated to him (section 1(1)(b)). 2. Section 12 of FOIA provides, so far as material, as follows: (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit. (2) Subsection (1) does not exempt the public authority from its obligation to comply with paragraph (a) of section 1(1) unless the estimated cost of complying with that paragraph alone would exceed the appropriate limit. (3) In subsections (1) and (2) ""the appropriate limit"" means such amount as may be prescribed, and different amounts may be prescribed in relation to different cases. 3. The Secretary of State has made regulations which prescribe the appropriate limit for the purposes of section 12 of FOIA, namely the -4-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (""the Regulations""). 4. Regulation 3 of the Regulations prescribes that the appropriate limit for public authorities listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations is £600 and for all other public authorities is £450. In this Appeal the appropriate limit is £450. 5. Regulation 4(3) of the Regulations provides that in estimating the cost of complying with a request to which section 1(1) of FOIA would otherwise apply, a public authority may ""take account only of the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in- a) determining whether it holds the information, b) locating the information, or a document which may contain the information, c) retrieving the information, or a document which may contain the information, and d) extracting the information from a document containing it."" 6. Regulation 4(4) of the Regulations provides that where costs are attributable to the time that is expected to be taken by persons undertaking the activities specified in regulation 4(3), ""those costs are to be estimated at a rate of £25 per person per hour"". 7. Regulation 5 of the Regulations provides so far as material as follows: ""(1) In circumstances in which this regulation applies, where two or more requests for information to which section 1(1) of -5-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 the 2000 Act would, apart from the appropriate limit, to any extent apply, are made to a public authority - (a) by one person, or (b) by different persons who appear to the public authority to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign, the estimated cost of complying with any of the requests is to be taken to be the total costs which may be taken into account by the authority, under regulation 4, of complying with all of them, (2) This regulation applies in circumstances in which – (a) the two or more requests referred to in paragraph (1) relate, to any extent, to the same or similar information, and (b) those requests are received by the public authority within any period of sixty consecutive working days” 8. The Appellant set up a website that aims to be able to provide a service which allows interested individuals to request relevant recorded information from every member of staff of a university. In addition, it provides the facility to request the same information from every university in the country simultaneously. 9. The Appellant made a number of requests for information. These included the four requests for information that are the subject of this Appeal. Two were made on 26 April 2010 and two were made on 28 April 2010. A full copy of the requests can be found in Appendix A -6-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 which is attached to the bottom of this judgement (numbered requests 1 to 4). [Pages 17-21 of the Decision Notice] 10. On 29 April 2010 the public authority issued its response. It explained that having aggregated the requests it had received within the last 60 days it estimated that the work it was required to undertake in order to comply with these requests exceeded the appropriate limit of 18 hours. The public authority provided a breakdown of the work it had undertaken in respect to 4 earlier requests for information from the Appellant and indicated that that work had already exceeded the 18- hour limit. The breakdown showed that some 21 hours had already been expended. 11. A copy of these four earlier requests for information can be found in Appendix B, which is also attached to the end of this Judgement (these are numbered requests 5 to 8). [Pages 22-25 of the Decision Notice] 12. The public authority explained that complying or being in the process of complying with these four requests meant that the appropriate limit had already been reached and that it was excluded from complying with the four later requests (as listed in Appendix A). 13. Later that day, the Appellant wrote to request an internal review. He said that aggregation was not appropriate as the requests were not for similar information and this was a requirement to apply section 12(1). He explained that in his view the requests covered entirely different topics. He also explained that he had made the same requests to all the other universities in the country who had not raised the issue of aggregation that led to the application of the costs limit. 14. On 6 May 2010 the public authority explained that its response was based on its understanding of the relevant guidelines and regulations. The public authority explained that the similarity between the requests was that they were all related to staff and staff operations. It then cited -7-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 the relevant parts of the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 15. On 8 May 2010 the Appellant contacted the Commissioner to complain about the way his requests for information had been handled. The Appellant specifically asked the Commissioner to consider the following points: <U+F0B7> That the requests covered entirely different topics and that invoking section 12(1) was inappropriate; and <U+F0B7> That the original requests were sent to a number of universities simultaneously. 16. On 13 July 2010 the Commissioner wrote to the Appellant. He confirmed that this case would consider only the four requests outlined in Appendix A. He said he would make a decision about the operation of section 12(1) specifically in relation to these requests. 17. The Commissioner issued a Decision Notice dated 19 January 2011 which determined that it was appropriate to aggregate the work required to answer for requests 1-4 and 7-8 because these six requests had an overarching theme; according to the Commissioner “they were similar to some extent as they were enquiries for the policies or regulations and/or how those policies or regulations operated in the university” -8-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 The appeal to the Tribunal 18. On 20 January 2011 Mr Benson submitted an appeal to the Tribunal (IRT). 19. The Notice of Appeal challenges the Commissioner's Decision Notice on ground that the Commissioner erred in finding that requests 1-4 and 7-8 could be aggregated under Regulation 5 of the Regulations. In particular, the Commissioner noted in his Response,: (1) the Appellant challenged the Commissioner's use of the language of an 'overarching theme'; (2) he suggested that if the Commissioner's interpretation of Regulation 5 of the Regulations is correct, then all information requested by one person in any period of sixty working days will be aggregated; (3) he illustrated his argument by reference to a worked example; and (4) he relied on the ICO guidance notes, the position under the Scottish regulations on the aggregation of costs and the fact that 144 other universities did not attempt to aggregate his requests. The questions for the Tribunal 20. The Tribunal considered that the sole question for them was to consider whether the Commissioner erred in finding that requests 1-4 and 7-8 could be aggregated under Regulation 5 of the Regulations. The Tribunal noted that there appeared to be no dispute between the parties that the 6 requests were all submitted by the same person within a period of ‘sixty consecutive working days’. There also -9-Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 appeared to be no dispute that, if aggregated, then the work involved would in total exceed the costs threshold. Evidence 21. The parties agreed that this matter should be considered ‘on the papers’ only and we have heard no live evidence or oral submissions. No parties or representatives have attended the hearing. 22. We have considered, from the Appellant, the Notice and Grounds of Appeal. 23. We have considered, from the Commissioner, the Decision Notice, and the Response to Appeal. 24. There were no submissions from the public authority. 25. The Commissioner submitted that he had considered whether the requests related, ""to any extent, to the same or similar information"". The Commissioner relied on the observations of the Information Tribunal in Ian Fitzsimmons v Department for Culture, Media and Sport [EA/2007/0124] that the test seemed very wide and only required that the requests relate to any extent to the same or similar information (Tribunal emphasis). 26. The Commissioner also referred to the dictionary definition of ""similar' as meaning 'Having a resemblance or likeness: of the same kind'. The Commissioner took the view that requests were 'similar' where there was an overarching theme or common thread running between them, in terms of the nature of the information that had been requested. - 10 -Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 Conclusion and remedy 27. The Tribunal noted the lack of authorities on the interpretation of s.12 FOIA and the associated Regulations. The Tribunal also noted that the Fitzsimmons case referred to at paragraph 25 merely restates the legislative requirement with added emphasis. 28. The Tribunal carefully considered the requests from the Appellant numbered 1-4 and 7-8 and concluded on balance and as a matter of fact that they did not all relate, ""to any extent, to the same or similar information”. 29. Whilst the Tribunal understood the Commissioner’s analysis the Tribunal felt that it was not compelling and relied on concepts that were not actually within the legislation – e.g. ‘overarching theme’. The Tribunal felt that any consequent uncertainty should, on balance, be resolved in the Appellant’s favour. 30. The Tribunal did not therefore give further consideration to the estimates provided by the public authority except that to note that in each case the estimate of the work required for each request taken individually would not reach the limit set under the Regulations and hence s 12(1) of FOIA is not engaged. The Tribunal noted and supported the view on the estimates taken by the Commissioner in his Decision Notice which was, “that there are no obvious alternatives in this case that would render the estimates unreasonable.” (paragraph 52) 31. It should be noted that the Tribunal did not reach a firm conclusion on whether requests 7 & 8 could be aggregated on the basis that they both related to ‘human resources’ issues. However the Tribunal found it unnecessary to reach a conclusion on the point as even if aggregated the work involved fell below the costs threshold. - 11 -Appeal No.: EA/2011/0016 32. The Tribunal also wished to endorse the Commissioner’s view that the public authority should have provided the Appellant with reasonable advice and assistance in accordance with s.16(1) FOIA (paragraphs 64 and 66 of the Decision Notice). In particular the Tribunal noted that under the Code of Practice on the discharge of public authorities’ functions under part 1 of the FOIA 2000 (Issued under s45 of the Act in November 2004), this has been clarified in relation to s12(1) matters in the following terms, “the Authority should consider providing an indication of what, if any, information could be provided within the cost ceiling. The Authority should also consider advising the applicant that by reforming or re-focussing their request, information may be able to be supplied for a lower, or no fee.” Our decision on allowing this appeal is consequently unanimous Signed: Angus Hamilton DJ(MC) Judge Date: 28 September 2011 - 12 -"

Action Required In addition to the information disclosed to Mr Gradwick prior to and during the course of the appeal proceedings the Foreign & Commonwealth Office are also to disclose (remove the redaction of) the security markings on all documents so far disclosed to Mr Gradwick by 30 September 2011. Dated this 23 day of August 2011 Signed Angus Hamilton DJ(MC) Judge -3-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. By way of an email dated 8 January 2009 Mr Gradwick applied to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) for the disclosure, in particular, of documents held by them pertaining to the removal of Jose Mauricio Bustani as Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 2. Mr Gradwick’s request read as follows: Please disclose any letters, e-mails, reports, papers, memoranda or other documents held by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office concerning Jose Mauricio Bustani the former Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. I am particularly interested in receiving copies of documents relating to the meeting held at The Hague on 21st April 2002 where his removal was sought. I am also interested in receiving copies of documents discussing or otherwise relating to Judgement 2232 of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation. 3. By way of a letter dated 10 March 2009 the FCO replied to Mr Gradwick that they would release some of the sought information to him but would withhold (or redact) other information on the basis that it was exempt from disclosure under s.27(1) of the FOIA and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. 4. Mr Gradwick then sought an internal review and in a letter in reply dated 2 June 2009 the FCO upheld its own initial decision. -4-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 The complaint to the Information Commissioner 5. Mr Gradwick then submitted a complaint to the Office of the Information Commissioner on 26 July 2009 objecting both to the delay in the FCO answering his original request and their reliance upon s27 of FOIA to withhold information. 6. The Commissioner issued a Decision Notice dated 21 July 2010 which determined that the FCO had, save in one respect, dealt with Mr Gradwick’s request appropriately. The one exception was that the Commissioner determined that the FCO should have set out which particular subsections of s27(1) it was relying on. The appeal to the Tribunal 7. On 18 August 2010 Mr Gradwick submitted an appeal to the Tribunal (IRT). His Grounds of Appeal are set out in the Open Bundle of Documents before us at pp 25-28. 8. During the course of the appeal proceedings there were two developments that should be mentioned at this stage. First the FCO reviewed the information redacted from documents released to Mr. Gradwick and decided to release further material to him. Secondly the FCO sought to rely on an additional exemption (namely s.40(2) FOIA) in relation to the non-disclosure of ‘junior’ civil servants names which had been redacted from the documents disclosed to Mr Gradwick. This exemption had not been relied on by the FCO prior to the submission of Mr Gradwick’s appeal to the IRT. This step (sometimes referred to as a ‘late-claimed exemption’) was opposed by Mr Gradwick but was permitted by the Tribunal in accordance with the decision in Home Office v IC & Habibi [2011] UKUT 17 (AAC). -5-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 The questions for the Tribunal 9. With respect to the central issue of the reliance on s27(1) in relation to the redacted information we found the analysis of Mr Gradwick’s Grounds of Appeal set out in the final submissions from the Commissioner to be helpful. This read: 10. In his Response to the appeal, the Commissioner identified five grounds of appeal that appeared to be disclosed by the Appellant's Notice of Appeal. In his 'Reply Submission to Directions One and Two' of 11 October 2010, the Appellant clarified that he has seven grounds of appeal as set out at paragraph 10 of the Appellant's Reply Submission. These grounds may, it is submitted, be helpfully addressed as follows in the context of the legal issues that arise on this appeal: 1) Has the FCO properly applied the exemptions in s 27(l)(a) and/or (b) of FOIA to the information requested, i.e., first, has the FCO shown that the information in question would, or would be likely to, prejudice (a) relations between the United Kingdom and any other State and/or (b) relations between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or international court? 2) Second, does the balance of public interest favour withholding or disclosing the information that has been redacted by the FCO from the documents disclosed? 3) In particular, in considering (1) and/or (2): a. Can each of the redactions be justified by reference to s 27(l) or any of its subsections? (Appellant's First Ground) -6-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 b. Has the government adopted a policy of citing s 27(l) in all cases where a disclosure would show the US in a bad or otherwise embarrassing light, effectively turning the exemption at s 27(l) into an absolute exemption where the US is concerned? (Appellant's Second Ground) c. Have the arguments that have been put forward to justify the redactions been inconsistently and arbitrarily applied? (Appellant's Third Ground) d. Is there evidence of undue influence being exerted by any of the states party to the Chemical Weapons Convention on other state parties? (The Appellant asserts that the documents which have been disclosed suggest that undue influence was exerted, as a consequence of which the Appellant concurs with the Commissioner's statement at §39 of the Decision Notice that this indicates a 'compelling' public interest in disclosure.) (Appellant's Fourth Ground) e. Does the balance of public interest favour disclosure? (Appellant's Fifth Ground) 4) The Appellant believes that officials at the FCO unlawfully disclosed his personal data to US authorities in contravention of s 55(3) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (""DPA""). (Appellant's Sixth Ground). Is this an issue that properly arises for determination on this appeal? 5) The Appellant further contends (Appellant's Seventh Ground) that the Commissioner has failed to correctly carry out his statutory duty under s. 50(3) of FOIA. (This relates to -7-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 the fact that the Commissioner did not consider whether the names of civil servants had been properly redacted as part of his investigation.) Is this an issue that properly arises for determination on this appeal? If so, what order should the Tribunal make? 11. The secondary question for the Tribunal to determine is whether the FCO were justified in relying on s.40(2) of FOIA to redact the names of junior civil servants from the documents disclosed to Mr Gradwick. Evidence 12. All parties have agreed that this matter should be considered ‘on the papers’ only and we have heard no live evidence or oral submissions. No parties or representatives have attended the hearing. 13. We have considered, from the Appellant, the Notice and Grounds of Appeal and his submissions from October and December 2010 (though the latter related almost wholly to the allowance of a late-claimed exemption under s.40(2) FOIA). There have been no recent submissions from Mr Gradwick even though there was a permissory direction to serve and file submissions prior to this hearing. Mr Gradwick has been contacted by the Tribunal about the lack of submissions and, in response, has asked the Tribunal to consider the issues raised in his Grounds of Appeal. 14. We have considered, from the Commissioner, the Decision Notice, the Response to Appeal and the final submissions. 15. We have considered, from the FCO, their Response to the Appeal, the final submissions, and the statements from Ms Morris (open and closed) and accompanying exhibits. -8-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 Conclusion and remedy 16. With respect to the reliance on s40(2) FOIA in relation to the redacted names of junior civil servants we were most persuaded by the helpful analysis set out in the final submissions from the FCO on this point. We approve and adopt those submissions which read as follows: 17. So far as concerns FOIA, s.40(2), the familiar analysis in this regard is that: (1) the withheld names comprise ""personal data"" within the meaning of DPA, s. 1 (1) (see FOIA, s.40(7)); and (2) their disclosure would contravene Data Protection Principle 1 (DPP1) so that FOIA, s.40(2)-(3) is engaged and they are exempt. 18. The key is essentially whether disclosure of the disputed names would contravene DPPI thereby triggering FOIA, s.40(3)(a)(i) or (b). This in turn comes down to whether disclosure would be ""fair"" for the purposes of DPA, Sch.1, Pt 1, para. 1 and meet the condition in DPA, Sch.2, para.6(l), ""necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed"". 19. It is submitted here that disclosure would cause ""prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests"" of those named to such an extent that it would be ""unwarranted"" and neither ""fair"" nor ""necessary"". Furthermore, such disclosure could not be made fair by way of a ""gateway"" under DPA, Sch.2 (including under para.6). It is further submitted that the ""necessary"" and ""warranted"" criteria in DPA, Sch.2, para.6 are not met when applied in accordance with the approach taken by the Information Tribunal -9-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 and the High Court in Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v IC & Brooke (EA/2007/060) 26/02/08, paras [60]-[61] and [2008] EWHC 1084 (Admin), [2009] 3 All ER 403 (DC). 20. The relevant three-fold test was also summarised by the First Tier Tribunal in Gibson v IC (EA/2009/0054) 22/0 1 /10: 19. Put shortly and somewhat self-evidently, for disclosure to be justified, the public's legitimate interest had to outweigh the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject. That equation was expressed in the following way in the Corporate Officer decision referred to above, in terms which were subsequently endorsed by the High Court by means of a three-fold test, namely: (1) there must be a legitimate public interest [in] disclosure; (2) that disclosure had to be necessary to meet that public interest,- and (3) the disclosure in question must not cause unwarranted harm to the interests of the individual. It is doubtful whether that three-fold formulation adds very much, if anything to the statutory language in Schedule 2, paragraph 6(l) in any event. 21. The IC's Practical Guidance Note ""When should names be disclosed?"" (15/08/08) identifies the following key factors, inter alia, when it comes to ""fairness"" (pp. 1-2): 1. Does the information requested relate primarily to the person's public function rather than their private life? 2. Should the individual expect their role to be subject to public scrutiny? You should consider: how senior they are; whether they have a public profile; and, whether their role requires a significant level of personal judgement and individual responsibility... - 10 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 22. The following guidance is then given at p.3: The presumption is in favour of protecting privacy, so the release of personal information will only be fair if there is a genuine reason to disclose. This involves a three-stage test. A public authority will generally have to satisfy itself that: <U+F0B7> there is a legitimate interest in disclosure; <U+F0B7> the legitimate interest can only be met, or fully met, by the disclosure of information which identifies individuals (i.e. the disclosure is necessary to that purpose); and, <U+F0B7> the disclosure would not involve unwarranted detriment to the individual's privacy or other rights and legitimate interests. This three-stage test is not exactly the same as a public interest test, but it involves similar considerations: <U+F0B7> You should identify the legitimate interests which a member of the public might have in the information. These may not be the same as, or limited to, any interest expressed by the particular requester, although any arguments they put forward should be considered. <U+F0B7> You should consider whether the names add to the value of the information, or whether the interests would be fully met by providing information with the names redacted. - 11 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 <U+F0B7> You should decide whether the benefits of disclosure are proportionate to any potential harm, distress or intrusion to the individuals named. 23. Applying the above considerations to this case, it is submitted that: the staff whose names have been withheld were in junior positions; they did not have a public or political profile or personal responsibility at a macro level for budgetary, personnel or policy matters; ministers and SMS grade staff were ultimately accountable for their work; and they therefore have a reasonable expectation that their privacy should be respected and their names protected. The withholding of the names of more junior staff who are not in public facing roles in such circumstances has recently been approved in, e.g. Dun v IC & NAO (EA/2010/0060) 18/01/11. 24. Consequently we conclude that the names of junior civil servants were rightly redacted from the documents disclosed by the FCO to Mr Gradwick and that the exemption in s40(2) FOIA was rightly claimed. 25. In relation to the redaction of the security markings on the documents disclosed to Mr Gradwick – this seems to have been treated as a peripheral issue by the Respondents and the submissions from the FCO are very brief. One of the principal points made by the FCO is that this information did not form part of Mr Gradwick’s initial request for information. However the same could be said of the redaction of junior civil servants’ names and yet this latter issue, as can be seen from the preceding paragraphs, has been addressed fully by the FCO and a specific FOIA exemption has been relied on. In relation to the removal of the security markings the FCO have not raised any FOIA exemption but assert that it can be justified on ‘relevance and practical grounds’ - 12 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 26. We have considered this issue carefully and have concluded that in the absence of any specifically claimed FOIA exemption this information falls to be disclosed to Mr Gradwick. 27. In relation to the redacted information where the Respondents rely on s.27(1)(a) and (b) FOIA we have been assisted by the helpful analysis set out in the Commissioner’s final submissions (paragraph 10 above). 28. We first considered the questions posed at paragraphs 10(4) and (5) above. In relation to the issue at paragraph 10(4) (the allegation of the wrongful disclosure of Mr Gradwick’s personal data to the US authorities) we consider that this is not an issue that falls to be considered as part of this appeal as it falls entirely outside its ambit. 29. In relation to the issue at paragraph 10(5) (the alleged failure by the Commissioner to perform his statutory duty under the FOIA) we also consider that this is not an issue that properly falls to be considered as part of this appeal. However, as is clear from this judgement, we have considered the issue of the redaction of junior civil servants’ names. It was the failure of the Commissioner to consider this point that led Mr Gradwick to allege a breach of statutory duty. 30. We then turned to consider the claimed s27(1) FOIA exemption in relation to the redacted data and the issues set out in paragraphs 10(1) and (2) above. Our approach was to consider first the redacted information - which was made available to us in submitted the ‘closed bundle’ - and secondly the detailed explanation for the redaction of that information set out in the ‘closed’ statement of Jill Morris. 31. Having considered these points we concluded in relation to each piece of redacted information that that information would, or would be likely to, prejudice: - 13 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 (a) relations between the United Kingdom and any other State and/or (b) relations between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or international court? And that consequently the exemption at s27(1)(a) and/or (b) was properly claimed by the FCO. 32. We also concluded that the balance of public interest favoured withholding the information. 33. It is not possible to give more detailed reasons for reaching these conclusions as to do so would inevitably involving disclosing the information that is exempt from disclosure. 34. We did however note that even after the FCOs review of their redactions there is still an inconsistency in the FCO’s approach to redaction. At paragraph 4.4 of Ms. Morris’ closed statement an explanation is given for the redaction of the information at CBD/15/38/A. This is, in brief, the specific countries that voted for/against or abstained in relation to the vote of no confidence in Mr. Bustani on 22/03/02. However we also note from the most recent bundle of reviewed redacted documents that this very information has in fact been disclosed to Mr. Gradwick. 35. Our analysis is that the redaction of this specific information could have been justified by relying on s.27(1)(a). However given that the information has now been disclosed we would invite the FCO to look again at other documents containing this information with a view to applying a consistent approach across all documents. We note that the FCO has already done this in relation to the specific countries which opposed/supported/abstained in relation to the vote of 22/04/02. The FCOs position is that this information could have been withheld under - 14 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0151 s27(1)(a) but that since it has been disclosed ‘in error’ there should now be consistent disclosure (paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of Jill Morris closed statement) 36. Mr. Gradwick has been right to express concern (paragraph 10(3)c above) about the inconsistent approach adopted by the FCO in relation to redactions. We are however satisfied that - given the reviews conducted by the FCO during the course of this appeal and providing the issues raised in the preceding paragraphs are addressed – this particular concern has now been dealt with appropriately. 37. Following the analysis set out at paragraph 10 above this leaves us to consider briefly the points raised at paragraphs 10(3)b and d above. On these points we would like to offer Mr. Gradwick the reassurance that, having carefully inspected the information redacted from the documents disclosed to him, we could find no evidence whatsoever to support his concerns that information was redacted solely because its disclosure would have caused embarrassment to the US or because it would have disclosed inappropriate pressure being applied by any member countries of the CWC.

"267","Procedural Refusal","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2011/0054 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50278216 Dated: 16 December 2010 Appellant: Mr M Gardner First Respondent: Information Commissioner Second Respondent: Nottingham City Homes Limited Heard at: Field House, London Date of consideration: 4 July 2011 Date of decision: 4 August 2011 Before Christopher Hughes OBE Judge and Henry FitzHugh and Dave Sivers Members Appearances: This hearing was conducted on the papers. Subject matter: FOIA S.14 whether the application is vexatious Cases considered: Durant v Financial Services Authority [2004] FSR 28, CA Rigby v the Information Commissioner and Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Trust EA/2009/0103 1DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the appeal for the reasons stated. Signed Christopher Hughes Judge 4 August 2011 2REASONS FOR DECISION 1. The Appellant has been a tenant of Nottingham City Council for more than 30 years. He submitted a request for information to Nottingham City Homes (NCH - the corporate vehicle used by the Council to manage the property he rented) on 10 July 2009. The request was in three parts, however the second and third part were resolved prior to the decision of the ICO and the matter before the Tribunal was the first part of the request:- “(1)… a breakdown of how much money has been spent by City Council/NCH on numbers x and y {place} since 1998 to the present and what, in particular has been done regards maintenance, i.e. replaced, improved, or restored at these properties since 1998 to present.” 2. The request was refused and on 11 December 2009 the Appellant, acting via his CAB, requested an internal review. The Appellant had, in the meantime, started the process of complaining to the ICO. The NCH response to this request was contained in a letter dated 17 May 2010. This noted that the request had been reduced to that set out above and stated:- “I maintain the view that the information requested is the personal data of the tenants 1 and 6 … and therefore the S.40 exemption under FOIA should apply. It is my view that you are not making a general request as to expenditure in his area and the history of complaints you have raised with the Company, and the Ombudsman indicate that fact you focus your requests on particular tenants, tenancies or the way you believe those tenancies have been conducted i.e. immediate neighbours. This in my view would defeat any assertion that the details of the tenancy including expenditure are separate from the personal circumstances or data of the tenant(s) concerned. The Company does not disclose details of tenancies of third parties unless a specific exemption applies or pursuant to a court order or the written authorisation of the data subject/tenant in order to ensure compliance with the principles of the Data Protection Act and to maintain the privacy of the individual Council tenants. Your initial request for the repair records of your own property No.z {place} has been complied with. Accordingly, in reviewing your request, I reiterate the application of the Section 40 FOIA exemption. Further or in the alternative, I apply Section 14(1) FOIA exemption in that this is a repeated request on issues previously raised with the Company.” 3. The Appellant pursued his request in a letter to the IC dated 18 June 2010. This stated:- “As anticipated NCH/Council are saying nothing new and have more or less repeated what they previously have said which clearly has nothing to do with the costing and inventory of repairs, redevelopment and alterations carried out by the housing department and its contractors from Jan 1998 to the present. 3I can well understand NCH reticence in not wishing this information made public, nevertheless this is public information concerning public money. [The Company Secretary] in typical pedantic legal jargon is quite incorrect in her assumptions, I have and had always requested the information concerning tenancies No.’s x,y and z. Singularly NCH/Council only own these properties, the rest in the block are all privately owned and therefore of no consequence. Nottingham City Council Tenants do not pay for their own repairs or alterations. Since 1998 there have been numerous tenants at both No’s x and y {place}, all of whom are of absolutely no interest to me whatsoever. NCH have really no argument to put forward there is no conflict in my request concerning individuals personal data. This is solely concerning NCC owned properties. I reiterate again, this is not information concerning individuals, this is public information concerning public money spent on repairs, alterations etc carried out by Nottingham City Homes/Council on public properties, names No.’s x and y {place}. I therefore urge you to please continue with my request.” 4. By a letter dated 25 August 2010 the Second Respondent in these proceedings maintained its position. It asserted that the current reduced application should be seen in the context of the previous, slightly wider application which mentioned a former tenant by name:- “Accordingly in my view he is seeking personal data to which the Section 40 exemption applies. I have therefore construed the Complainant’s request in terms of his wish to see what has been spent on his neighbouring tenants properties as compared with his property where he believes his ongoing complaints of alleged disrepair have not been attended to by the Company.” 5. The letter went on to assert that the request was vexatious and that because of concerns about health and safety the Council had obtained an interim injunction against the Appellant concerning his conduct; this (the Council state) had however not been continued in the light of the Appellant’s health. From the evidence and pleadings in the application to this Tribunal it appears that an Interim injunction was sought without notice and never came to a contested hearing on the merits. 6. Following an investigation the First Respondent issued his decision notice on 16 December 2010. This found that the request was a vexatious request and accordingly upheld the position of the Second Respondent. It did not address other issues raised by the Second Respondent during the course of the investigation. 7. The Appellant (by his solicitor) challenged this decision by an appeal dated 23 February 2011 supported by a witness statement of 1 June 2011. The First Respondent in his response of 23 March 2011 reaffirmed the position set out in his decision notice. While the Second Respondent was joined as a party to these proceedings it has not taken any active part and it appears to have been content to rely entirely on the position of the First Respondent. 8. In considering this appeal the Tribunal has been hampered by the failure of the Second Respondent to take an active role and in particular its failure to respond to the detailed arguments put forward by the Appellant in his correspondence and notice of appeal. In order to ensure the fair and proportionate resolution of this case the Tribunal has however considered the arguments advanced by the Second Respondent 4in correspondence and replied to by the Appellant even though they are not addressed in the Decision Notice. 9. The Second Respondent initially relied on S40(2) of FOIA that the information sought was personal data (in this case relating to other tenants). The request however relates to expenditure on tenanted property over an extended period of time, not to the individual tenants. From the evidence of the Appellant (which was not contradicted or rebutted by the other parties) there have during that period been a number of tenants in both properties. The data requested is information about investment and expenditure on properties and not a request about individuals. In Durant the Court of Appeal held that personal data:- “is information that affects [a person’s] privacy, whether in his personal or family life, business or professional capacity”. 10. The information requested does not have this characteristic and the Tribunal is satisfied that the First Respondent was correct to discount this argument. 11. In coming to his conclusion that the request for information was vexatious within section 14(1) of FOIA the First Respondent carried out a balancing exercise in accordance with his established practice of looking at five relevant factors; an approach which has been broadly accepted by the Tribunal: Rigby v the Information Commissioner and Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Trust EA/2009/0103. These factors are:- (1) Could the request fairly be seen as obsessive or manifestly unreasonable? (2) Is the request harassing the authority or distressing to staff? (3) Would complying with the request impose a significant burden in terms of expense and distraction? (4) Is the request designed to cause disruption or annoyance? (5) Does the request lack any serious purpose of value? 12. The Information Commissioner correctly identified the need to ensure that it was the request and not the requester that was assessed as vexatious, however in considering the applicability of S14 care must be taken to fairly assess the context in which the request is made. The Commissioner drew attention to complaints alleging anti-social behaviour by another tenant made by the Appellant in 2005-2006 which were not upheld by the Ombudsman in 2007, and a number of complaints made in 2003 -2008 about the conduct of another tenant, inappropriate allocation to that tenant and:- “alleged housing disrepair of his own tenancy. The misallocation allegation is currently the subject of an investigation by the Audit Commission”. 13. The uncontested evidence of the Appellant is that he and several other residents complained about the conduct of a tenant which resulted in an ASBO and then an eviction. He has been without a gas supply for cooking and heating since 1997 but he continued to be charged with respect to it until 2004 and there has been no repayment. He has unsuccessfully asked for his heating and cooking to be switched over to electricity which would be more convenient for him. An agreement as to the behaviour of workmen coming to his flat (which was agreed under the Disability Discrimination Act as a reasonable adjustment) has not been implemented. From this evidence it is clear that, to put it at its lowest, there have been problems associated with the Appellant’s occupancy of his flat which have been caused, at least in part, by the actions of others. 514. At paragraph3 36-38 of the Decision Notice the First Respondent concluded that by revisiting issues previously raised and indicating that he would seek to verify any information provided as a result of his request the Appellant “stepped over the fine line between persistence and a request being obsessive and unreasonable”. However the actual request for this information was first made some nine years ago; to repeat the request once the FOIA is in force is not unreasonable, the “revisiting of issues previously raised” on analysis (see paragraph 13 above) is dealing with the range of complex matters which have arisen over the years some of which have not been resolved and seeking verification of information is not manifestly unreasonable. 15. At paragraphs 39-41 of the Decision Notice the First Respondent addresses the factor of “harassing the public authority and causing distress to staff”. The test which he applied was whether a reasonable person would have regarded the request as harassing or distressing. He incorrectly relied on the length of time and nature of the request (see 13 and 14 above) and draws attention to “the threatening and intimidating nature of correspondence”. In a letter concerning the injunction dated 15 March 2010 the Appellant stated:- “Nottingham City Council/Nottingham City Homes and others have been guilty of discrimination, victimisation, intimidation, harassment and neglect. It is now my sworn duty to seek rightful Justice to find out and disclose the person or persons wholly responsible for the repugnant and offensive injunction and ensuing witch-hunt. Beware the Ides of March, I will have my Retribution.” This is intemperate language. It was written as a result of litigation which deeply distressed the Applicant. However experienced members of staff receiving such a letter would be unlikely to significantly concerned by its contents. 16. At paragraphs 42 and 43 the Decision Notice addresses the issue of “burden and distraction”. Again the First Respondent erred by conflating the real, substantial and partially unresolved issues concerning the Appellant’s tenancy and neighbouring properties with the request. The Second Respondent had correctly conceded that the request was unlikely to be labour intensive. While there is a possibility of further correspondence as a result of complying with the request (and if necessary verifying the disclosed information) the Tribunal is not satisfied that the burden will be significant. 17. At paragraphs 44 and 45 the First Respondent correctly concluded that the request was not designed to cause disruption and annoyance. 18. At paragraphs 46 and 47 the First Respondent concluded, on the basis of the correspondence, that the Second Respondent had demonstrated that the request had no value or purpose and:- “that the request has become a manifestation of the complainant’s substantive complaints. As such he has concluded that the request has no serious value or purpose in its context.” 19. The Tribunal finds this a surprising conclusion. In the correspondence upon which the First Respondent relies there are allegations of breach of statutory duty as a housing authority with respect to the tenancy and allegations of failure to accord the Appellant his rights under disability discrimination legislation. The original request in its third part 6sought the same information with respect to the Appellant’s own tenancy. This is a transparent attempt to obtain evidence that other properties have had more resources spent on them than the Appellant’s; with a clear view to using that information to found a claim under discrimination or housing legislation. It is no part of this Tribunal’s role to determine the substantive merits of such claims; however they are at least theoretically conceivable and in the context of the application, clearly apparent. The application therefore has a clear purpose and value. 20. The Tribunal is satisfied that in its response to the request for disclosure of information the Second Respondent has focussed too much on the history of its relations with the Appellant and has not considered the request on its merits. 21. The Tribunal is satisfied that the First Respondent has erred in finding that the application is vexatious and finds in favour of the Appellant. Chris Hughes Tribunal Judge 4 August 2011 7"

Signed Judge Taylor 22 February 2010 -2- EA/2010/0095IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL EA/2010/0095 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Appellant seeks an agreement from Craven District Council (‘Craven’) that it entered into with its erstwhile Chief Executive Officer (‘ex-CEO’), covering the terms of her departure. 2. The dispute before the Tribunal concerns whether the requested information is exempt by virtue of s40(2) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’). The Request for Information 3. On 30 June 2009, the Appellant wrote to the Council stating: a. “I believe you are in possession of an agreement between the Council and Mrs Gill Dixon entered into at the time she left employment of the Council as Chief Executive Officer. I believe also that such an agreement would contain the terms upon which she left her employment. Can you please confirm these two beliefs? If you hold such document (or documents), I hereby request that you provide me with a copy under the Freedom of Information Act…” 4. On 1 July 2009, Craven confirmed it held the requested information (“the Compromise Agreement”), but that “in relation to an earlier similar FOI request… the Council’s decision was that the information was exempt from disclosure under s.40(2) Freedom of Information Act 2000… the Information Commissioner … subsequently ruled that it would be unfair to the former employee to release the information...“ 5. Curiously, the council did not state that they considered the Appellant’s specific request was exempt under section 40(2); or why disclosure would be unfair (and the statutory relevance of “unfairness”); or make any reference at all to a contravention of the data protection principles. However, it implied that it considered the requested information exempt through relating the outcome of events for what they described as a similar FOI request. 6. On 11 July 2009, the Appellant requested the council review its decision. He asserted that it had not considered section 40(2)(b) properly, because it did not consider the legitimate interests of the public in the requested information. He claimed, without substantiating it, that there were suggestions that the relevant departure payments exceeded contractual entitlements and that the public had an interest in knowing whether this was so. He suggested there could not be harm caused to the individual if the payments did not exceed the contractual entitlements, but if they did, such harm was “warranted” as any excess may be “unlawful”. He stated that: “so much seems to have gone on,...within the work of the Council about which the Councillors freely admit a lack of knowledge,...” 7. On 21 August 2009, the review concluded that s.40(2) FOIA applied. It acknowledged a legitimate interest in “disclosure about information which would inform the public as to -3- EA/2010/0095whether the council and its senior officers have conducted itself lawfully”. It concluded that: “Having considered the terms of the agreement and the basis upon which it was entered into it is my conclusion that disclosure would cause unwarranted prejudice to the rights, freedoms or legitimate interests of the former employee.” However, it provided no detailed reasons for this nor how it had assessed and balanced the legitimate interests. The Complaint to the Information Commissioner 8. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 30 September 2009. 9. On 20 April 2010, the Commissioner’s Decision Notice concluded that Craven had dealt with the request in accordance with the FOIA. Relevant factors for deciding this included: a. The requested information was personal data of the ex-CEO, such that disclosure must not breach the data protection principles, including that the data must be “processed fairly and lawfully”. b. In determining what is fair, the following was to be brought into the balance, including the possible consequences of disclosure for the ex-CEO and her reasonable expectations as to the use of her data: The Terms of the Compromise Agreement i. The terms of the requested Compromise Agreement, and the role of compromise agreements more generally in avoiding time, expense and stress of an Employment Tribunal, allowing the parties to conclude a relationship and make a fresh start. That the Employment Rights Act 1996 established the opportunity for parties to reach a compromise agreement. ii. There was a strong public interest in knowing the terms of the Compromise Agreement and how much public money was spent. However, disclosing such details may deter parties in the future from entering into such agreements. Citing the Audit Commission’s report, severance payments can also be in the public interest: “Reducing the number and size of severance payments may appear to be in the best interests of taxpayers, but quick, agreed departures can save public money. Dysfunctional relationships, or drawn-out legal disputes at the top of organisations, can have substantial negative effects on services. So, councils are permitted to agree payments on contract terminations as being in the ‘efficiency of the service’.” 1 Consequences of disclosure iii. Although difficult to prove, further disclosures beyond what was already in the public domain might pose a risk to the CEO’s chance of promotion or employment; affect her emotional wellbeing and be intrusive. iv. Unlike with a local news story, a disclosure under the FOIA could become part of a permanent and easily searchable/accessible source which may increase the unfairness of disclosure. Reasonable expectations v. Of particular weight, the CEO would have an expectation of privacy which would be objectively reasonable. However, expectations should be modified by the existence of the FOIA’s presumption in favour of disclosure of information. 1 http://www.auditcommission.gov.uk/localgov/nationalstudies/bymutualagreement/Pages/default_copy.aspx. -4- EA/2010/0095Private versus Public Life vi. A person’s public actions and work duties will be subject to greater scrutiny than aspects of their private lives. But details of “HR information” - such as pension contributions and tax codes - that might arise from the public life and be found within a compromise agreement, should remain private. Seniority of the CEO vii. The Commissioner’s guidance on s.40 FOIA states that generally the more senior the role within the public authority the greater the weight in favour of disclosure will be. Balancing the individual’s rights and the legitimate interests viii. The Commissioner weighed the individual’s rights to privacy against the strong pubic interest in disclosure which was itself tempered by the public interest in ensuring that parties were not deterred from entering into compromise agreements in the future. The Appeal to the Tribunal 10. Dr Gibson appealed to the Tribunal by notice dated 14 May 2010. The Tribunal joined Craven as a party. The parties agreed to have the matter determined by consideration of their documents without an oral hearing, and the panel met to consider the appeal. 11. The Tribunal has had the benefit of witness statements and submissions from the parties, (including some given in confidence); and bundles of documents and authorities submitted by the parties. The panel submitted further questions for all the parties on 3 October 2010. Consequently, the parties all gave further submissions. The Additional Party was requested to, if possible, provide evidence that the ex-CEO objected to disclosure, and a statement as to why disclosure might prejudice her legitimate interests. Accordingly, the ex-CEO submitted an open and confidential witness statement after the hearing. 12. We have considered all of this material, even if not specifically referred to below. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal 13. The Appellant confirmed at the case management hearing that his grounds for disputing the Commissioner’s decision were: (1) Legitimate Interest Test: Wrongly Assessed: a. That the Commissioner had wrongly concluded that the requested information should not be disclosed having reached the wrong decision in weighing the legitimate interests of the public against that of the outgoing CEO under condition 6 of Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). This was either by not taking all relevant factors into account, or wrongly doing so, or by giving too much weight to some. In so doing, the Commissioner either exercised its discretion wrongly or made an error in law; and/or (2) Personal Data: Certain Information May not be Personal Data. b. That at least part of the information within the Compromise Agreement was not personal data, and therefore should be disclosed. (The Appellant acknowledged that the requested information would seem to be personal data. However, since he had not seen the requested information, he was seeking for the Tribunal to consider whether the disputed information or any part of it was not personal data such that it may be disclosed in redacted form.) -5- EA/2010/0095Evidence: Appellant 14. In support of his grounds, the Appellant submitted amongst other things: a. The Audit Commission’s Local Government Report: “By Mutual Agreement: Severance Payments to Council Chief Executives” March 2010. This included: i. “Councils can suffer reputational damage from making severance payments… weak performance management arrangements mean that where there are genuine performance concerns councils often lack evidence to mount a case for dismissal… Councils … have a duty to consider fully the financial implications of any severance package, including any pension costs the Authority might have to cover. Non-monetary considerations, such as damage to the authority’s reputation or the difficulty of recruiting a replacement, should be taken into account.” The panel notes that whilst no parties made submissions on the matter, this report was published in March 2010 and so was not in existence at the time of the request and internal review by Craven. However, in the absence of argument to the contrary, we have considered the paragraphs above to still be relevant as providing a background to this appeal. It indicates the circumstances that applied around the time of the request which we expect that the public authority would or ought to have known about. In any event, whilst it provides background it did not determine any part of this decision. b. Audit Commission’s Audit 2008/9: “Use of Resources” of December 2009 2008/09 for Craven, including: i. “We have assessed the Council’s arrangements for 2008/09 as level 1, performing poorly…We reported significant failings to secure value for money in the use of resources last year…” ii. Level 1 was identified as meaning: “Does not meet minimum requirements”. iii. Score for Managing Finance (financial planning, understanding costs and performance, reporting financial performance): Level 1. iv. “The initial budget agreed for 2008/09 was not prepared in enough detail to make meaningful links with the service planning process…Treasury management was not effective for most of 2008/09… There has been a lack of clarity about the use of reserves.. The Council’s financial standing was seriously undermined by major overspending against 2007/08 budgets…The Council only had a very limited understanding of costs through the early part of 2008/09...” v. “Following the revelation of the scale of the Council’s financial crisis there was a period of significant tension and mistrust, but the change in political administration and a number of changes in senior management, including the appointment of a new Chief Executive, has enabled positive working relationships to be re-established.“ (“Item 63”). Again, the panel notes that whilst no parties made submissions on the matter, this report was published after the Council considered the request and review. However, in the absence of argument to the contrary, we consider it to be of relevance because it pertains to circumstances before or at the time of the request or review. c. Audit Commission’s “Annual Audit and Inspection Letter” for Craven: Audit 2007/08, March 2009, including: i. “The District Auditor took the unusual step of using his powers... to make a public statutory recommendation in December 2008, ‘for the Council to ensure that there is an adequately resources, experienced and skilled -6- EA/2010/0095Finance Department in place as soon as possible in order to deliver the functions required of it.” ii. “…The predicted budget underspend for 2007/08 did not materialise and instead the outturn was nearly £800,000 overspend. Further unexpected costs were identified during the current financial year, and as a result savings in the order of £2.5million need to be achieved over the next two years. iii. “Your appointed auditor… has been unable to issue his audit report for the 2007/08 financial year because of the Council’s failure to produce financial statements and supporting working papers of sufficient quality…” iv. Overall assessment for the council’s arrangements for the use of resources: 1 out of 4: “The Council failed to provide accounts that were materially correct… there was a failure to set a sufficiently detailed and robust Medium Term Financial Strategy… The Council failed to monitor the treasury management position during 2007/08...” d. Press Articles: (we did find the articles submitted to be clearly identified by source): i. “Now it’s a catastrophe” “… now we discover the shortfall over the next two years is not “just” a million. It is two and a half times that… It takes errors of an astronomical nature to get the budget so wrong and the repercussions are horrendous. People will lose their jobs…Services will be decimated…Top officials have gone (and severance payments to some have added to the burden)…“ ii. “Why £2.5m had to be saved and how the mess got worse”, 20 February 2009: “…Councillors - many of whom had said they had difficulty understanding the detail of local authority finances – have been left in no doubt about the gravity of the situation… But as it turned out councillors had not been given the correct information. Last April, the director of finance… left the council, followed in June by chief executive… A month later, the council’s economic problems came to light…” iii. “Council seeks a new chief executive as … resigns”, Craven Herald & Pioneer 20 June 2008: “Last month, an external investigator was brought in after a complaint against an unnamed senior official… The investigation concluded there was no suggestion of any misconduct. The independent investigator interviewed a number of officers and members, including the chief executive…” Various emails were also submitted, which the panel either did not consider particularly relevant or contained hearsay and potentially personal data. e. In response to the panel’s question, asking for elaboration on his statement: “the fact that some information is in the public domain should make it even more essential to publish the full story to quell rumour”: i. “Over a period of time, there were Editorials, articles, and letters in the local paper - The Craven Herald - on the subject of the troubles at Craven District Council and the sudden departure of the CEO, Mrs Gill Dixon. (See para. 14(d) above.) The Financial disasters e.g. the sale of Council land at well below value, the £2,000,000 loan taken out for no apparent purpose, obviously received much publicity as did the adverse 'Annual Audit and -7- EA/2010/0095Inspection Letter 2007/2008'. See para. 14(c) above.) I was never aware of any publicity for the harsh comments under Item 63 of the 'Use of Resources Audit 2008/2009' (See para. 14(b)(v)). Although this report was available to the public, the information was not easy to find. To the best of my knowledge the public were never given concrete reasons for Mrs Dixon's precipitate departure, any information on her severance pay, or indeed told of the use of a Compromise Agreement. Needless to say there were many wild rumours.” Evidence: Additional Party 15. The testimony of Gillian Cooper, Craven’s Head of Legal Services and Monitoring Officer included: a. “The relevant statutory provisions which relate to the termination of employment are contained in sections 111 and 112 of the Local Government Act 1972 2 , the Employment Rights Act 1996, JNC National Salary Framework and Conditions of Service for Local Authority Chief Executives and the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 2007. b. Following management concerns raised by two Directors within the Authority, on the 23rd March 2008… The Council met on the 8th April 2008 and a Panel of members was established… The Panel decided to appoint an external investigator to examine the issues in depth and report on the findings… The JNC Conditions of Service recognised that mutual termination of the contract of employment may be considered at any stage… During this process discussions continued with all parties concerned. It is recognised that mutual termination of the employment contract can be considered at any time and that sometimes this will be a suitable alternative for all concerned. c. Where financial settlements are considered it is necessary that the arrangements come within the local authority's powers for termination namely, sections 111 and 112 of the Local Government Act 1972, the JNC National Salary Framework and Conditions of Service for Local Authority Chief Executives and the relevant Pension Regulations, these being at the time the Local Government Pension Regulations 2007. The Council authorised only those payments except for one, which arose from contractual requirements, and statutory pension entitlements. d. The legality of the decision taken has been considered by the District Auditor as evidenced by paragraph 16 in his Report headed ""Financial Statement and Annual Governance"" [copy of that report attached – see para. 16(a) below]… Furthermore, the issue was considered by the District Auditor and his response to the resident who objected to the closure of accounts 2008/09 [see para. 16(b) below]… e. When the Council received the Appellant's request for information, I contacted the former Chief Executive to establish whether she consented to a disclosure of the terms of the Compromise Agreement. She did not. Her concerns related to her reputation and to maintaining the privacy of her family. 2 s.111 Local Government Act:“… a local authority shall have power to do any thing … which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions”. s.112: “Appointment of staff: (1) Without prejudice to section 111 above but subject to the provisions of this Act, a local authority shall appoint such officers as they think necessary....(2) An officer appointed under subsection (1) above shall hold office on such reasonable terms and conditions, including conditions as to remuneration, as the authority appointing him think fit. -8- EA/2010/0095f. …The Third Party has a duty as local authority, both to the public, and to its employees. The legislation recognises the authority's role as an employer to protect the rights of its employees. g. Detailed evidence on the background to this case has been submitted in support of the Additional Party's contention that the legal and financial basis for entering into the financial settlement and the Compromise Agreement was sound. Indeed the District Auditor has confirmed this. h. The Additional Party was in a position where there was a breakdown in its management arrangements. This had a detrimental impact on its governance arrangements and on its reputation. i. There is clear evidence that employment proceedings were in contemplation by the former Chief Executive and the use of compromise agreements in this situation is recognised. j. In reaching a settlement the need for costly legal proceedings which could prove damaging to the Additional Party in terms of time and reputation is recognised and there was a clear need at that time to stabilise the Additional Party's governance and management arrangements. It is submitted that this was recognised by the Auditors in their Use of Resources Audit which is referred to by the Appellant in the Good Governance Section paragraph 63 of the Council's 2008/09 (folder (f) Audit) dated December 2009. k. In addition it is submitted that the evidence demonstrates the impact on the former Chief Executive personally, reputationally and financially. Her position was and remains that she needed to protect herself and her family in order to secure her future career and there is no suggestion that this position has changed. Indeed the evidence indicates that she expects the Additional Party to adhere to the terms of the Compromise Agreement generally and in particular in relation to the need for references for future employment. Failing to adhere to the terms of the Compromise Agreement could potentially lead to litigation…. l. … There was a breakdown in the management and governance arrangements of the Additional Party however, the legal and financial basis for the settlement and Compromise Agreement was sound. The Compromise Agreement legitimately afforded the opportunity to the Additional Party to move forward to a more positive situation...” 16. There were many attachments to the statement. These included: a. Report on Financial Statement and Annual Governance Statement, undated: “… …” b. District Auditor’s Report to a resident who had objected to the closure of the 2008/09 accounts: “… -9- EA/2010/0095… .” 17. The written testimony of Ms Gill Dixon included the following: 18. In response to questions from the panel: a. The Chief Executive holds the statutory post of Head of Paid Service, and is the most senior officer reporting to the Leader of the council. b. Regarding the panel’s question about the new requirement for authorities to publish in their statements of accounts the individual financial details of any severance payments to all senior officers earning over £50,000, Craven clarified that this requirement only took effect for the 2009/2010 accounts. The severance - 10 - EA/2010/0095payment made to the ex-CEO was dealt with in 2008/2009 prior to these requirements and so no details were published. c. The ex-CEO officially left her post on 30th June 2008. d. Regarding the panel’s question: “The Appellant asserts in his submissions that ‘the financial ills were so grave that the public is entitled to a full explanation about how they came about and what steps the Councillors were taking for dealing with them.’ Does the Council have a response to this, and what was published in this regards?”: The Additional Party did not provide a response. e. Further documents: “ … … ” f. Letter from leader of council to the Councillors, dated 13 June 2008: “… - 11 - EA/2010/0095…"" Legal Submissions and Analysis 19. The submissions of all parties are considered below to the extent they apply to the issues before the Tribunal. We note that Craven did not provide non-confidential submissions, stating that it concurred with the Commissioner’s arguments. The Task of the Tribunal 20. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by section 58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or whether he should have exercised any discretion he had differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. The Questions for the Tribunal 21. The matters before the Tribunal concern whether the requested information is exempt by virtue of s40(2) FOIA. In particular: a. Is all the requested information personal data? b. What is the proper approach to considering the first Data Protection Principle? c. Would processing be fair? d. If so, would processing be lawful? e. If so, does condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 DPA apply? The Legislation 22. Section 1 FOIA sets out a right of access to recorded information held by public authorities. It is subject to various exemptions. - 12 - EA/2010/009523. Craven relies on the exemption in s.40(2) FOIA to resist disclosure. The part of that section relevant to the present appeal provides: “(2) Any information to which a request for information relates is ... exempt information if- (a) it constitutes personal data ..., and (b) ... the first ... condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is- (a) in a case where the information falls within… the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene - (i) any of the data protection principles ... (7) …“the data protection principles” means the principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998, as read subject to Part II of that Schedule .....” (Emphasis added.) 24. Personal Data is defined in s.1 DPA as: “… data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual;” (Emphasis added.) 25. It is agreed between the parties that, if the information is personal data, the only data protection principle (DPP) at risk of being contravened is the first principle set out in DPA Schedule 1, namely: “1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless- (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met…” - Part I, of Sch.1 of DPA The Principles. Emphasis added. 26. We are to interpret ‘fair’ in accordance with principles including: “1 (1)... regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed….” - Part II, of Sch.1 of DPA Interpretation of the Principles 27. The only Schedule 2 condition that has been referred to by the parties and that seems relevant is set out in paragraph 6(1), which we shall refer to as the “legitimate interest test”. It provides that: “6. -(1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by ... the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” -Sch.2 of DPA (Emphasis added.) 28. In this context, the type of ‘processing’ we are concerned with is disclosure to the Appellant as a member of the public. The ‘third party’ is the public. The ‘data subject’ is the outgoing CEO. - 13 - EA/2010/0095A. Is all the requested information personal data? 29. The Commissioner argues that all the information in the Compromise Agreement comprises personal data about the CEO. Whilst certain might be more obviously ‘personal’, the agreement in its entirety records the contract terms agreed with the ex-CEO and so disclosure of those terms would reveal something about the ex-CEO. The Law 30. The definition of data includes information “(c) recorded as part of a relevant filing system” as well as more generally recorded information held by public authorities. (s.1,DPA). 31. What makes data personal is where it relates to a living individual who can be identified from the data available. (s.1(1) DPA.) Whether it “relates to” the person identified depends on context and whether the information is sufficiently personal and focused on him/her. 3 Our Findings 32. It is clear to us that the requested information is data, and personal data, in its entirety. The Appellant has requested disclosure of an agreement entered into by a named individual, such that even if the Compromise Agreement were to be provided with the name blanked out, the ex-CEO would be identified. We consider all terms within a compromise agreement to have considerable personal connotations for the employee concerned, and for her to be the main focus of the agreement. B. What is the proper approach to considering the first Data Protection Principle? Submissions 33. The Commissioner has argued that a disclosure under FOIA must be (1) fair, (2) lawful and (3) meet at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 of the DPA. If any one of these criteria is ‘missing’, then disclosure does not comply with the first DPP 4 such that disclosure is not required because the s.40(2) exemption applies. 5 As the Commissioner concluded that disclosure of any part of the requested information would be ‘unfair’, he decided that it was not necessary to consider whether processing would be lawful or a condition in Schedule 2 DPA could be satisfied. 34. The Appellant argued that the Commissioner was wrong never to have considered the legitimate interest in disclosing the information. However, he did not elaborate on why, with reference to the provisions, the Commissioner would be required to take this approach. 3 See Durant v Financial Services Authority [2003] EWCA Civ 1746 para.s 26-31 4 See para. 25 above. 5 The exemption argued to apply under s.40(2) FOIA is “absolute”, as opposed to “qualified”. Information subject to a qualified exemption is only exempt from disclosure if the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. Information subject to an absolute exemption is exempt without considering this public interest test. - 14 - EA/2010/0095Our Findings 35. The Appellant may be arguing, that if one of the Schedule 2 conditions is met then the processing cannot be considered unfair or unlawful, such that the Commissioner should have considered the conditions as well as the general categories of fairness and lawfulness before deciding whether the information was exempt. However, our reading of the first DPP and the conditions is that the words “and, in particular”, indicate that the processing can only be fair and lawful if at least one of the conditions is met. It is not that if one of the conditions is met then the processing cannot be considered unfair or unlawful. Therefore, the Commissioner’s approach seems to have been valid. (However, we note that the Commissioner’s guidance on s.40 FOIA, recommends considering whether disclosure satisfies one of the specific conditions first, before moving on to the general consideration of fairness and lawfulness, and states that for practical purposes, disclosure will generally be fair if a Schedule 2 condition 6 has been satisfied. This is because a general consideration of fairness will involve balancing very similar issues to those set out above. We prefer this more comprehensive approach because the conditions are specific examples of what are to be considered fair or lawful.) 36. Alternatively, the Appellant may have been arguing that the Commissioner did not consider the legitimate interests of disclosure properly when considering the general category of fairness, such that it was wrongly concluded that disclosure would be unfair. In both the Decision Notice and submissions in this appeal, the Commissioner did indicate that “balancing of the rights of the individual with the legitimate interests in disclosure” was a factor when considering “fairness” generally. We have taken this broader interpretation of the Appellant’s grounds of appeal because he was not legally represented, these provisions are legally complex and the other parties appear to have done the same. Therefore, we proceed to consider whether the requested disclosure would be unfair. C. Would processing be fair? Submissions 37. We summarise below what we consider the parties’ most pertinent arguments. For ease of reference, we make comments about individual arguments in brackets immediately after them. 38. In considering fairness, the Commissioner’s submissions repeated much of what had been stated in the Decision Notice (as summarized in paragraph 9 above). Other matters included: a. Consequences of Disclosure: unjustified harm or distress i. It was a reasonable assumption that disclosure might well impact on the CEO’s prospects of promotion or employment and unreasonable to suggest otherwise. b. Reasonable Expectations: Confidentiality: Consent and expectation: i. The CEO does not consent to disclosure. ii. She did not expect that the terms of the Compromise Agreement would come into the public domain, because the terms were not in the public domain at the time of the request. - 15 - EA/2010/0095Confidentiality: iii. The CEO’s expectations would have been affected by the confidentiality provision in the agreement. However, in response to a panel question, that a public authority should not try to ‘contract out’ of its obligations under FOIA: “ A public authority should not try to ‘contract out’ of its obligations under FOIA. The Commissioner encourages public authorities to consider carefully the nature of confidentiality clauses when entering into contracts, although he makes clear that there can be no absolute guarantee of confidentiality, regardless of the wording of a confidentiality clause. The Commissioner also points to the Section 45 Code of Practice which records one of its aims as being to ‘promote consideration by public authorities of the implications for Freedom of Information before agreeing to confidentiality provisions in contracts’ (see Part V of that Code). It is to be noted that that Code appears to focus on the commercial contract aspect.” iv. The Compromise Agreement differs from a commercial contract entered into by a public authority with another party. It also differs from a standard employment contract. Disclosure of the terms of such a contract (which would be between all or the majority of members of staff within a public authority) would differ vastly from those in the agreement (which relates only to the ex-CEO). v. The primary relevance of the confidentiality clause in this case is to the ‘fairness’ limb of the first data protection principle. In other words, it is relevant to what the ex-CEO might reasonably have expected to happen to the information in the Compromise Agreement. vi. In the Wilson decision the Tribunal accepted that generally, a confidentiality agreement would give rise to a reasonable expectation that no further information would be released. Timing: vii. Given that the CEO’s departure was one year before the request, consideration should be given to the fairness of further publicity when the individual may have ‘moved on’. c. Private versus Public Life i. Information on ‘personnel matters’ attracts a very strong expectation of privacy. d. Data Subject’s rights and freedoms balanced against the legitimate interests in disclosure i. There is a strong but not overriding interest public interest in knowing the terms of the Compromise Agreement and how much money was spent. ii. There is a strong public interest in preserving such agreements as vehicles for ending the employer/employee relationship. iii. The legitimate interests of the public in accessing the requested information is not sufficient to outweigh the CEO’s right to privacy, particularly given the substantial detriment that would result from disclosure, which would involve a significant invasion of her privacy. - 16 - EA/2010/0095iv. This is particularly so given that the District Auditor’s report provides information about the legal powers for the ex-CEO’s termination of employment and accounts for the termination payments made to her. (See para.16 above). There is no indication from these letters that there was anything untoward. 39. The Appellant made various arguments to support his appeal without always clearly identifying which parts of the first DPP the arguments might fit within. We have sought to apply his arguments where they most sensibly fit. They include: a. Terms of Compromise agreement i. The Commissioner makes a general case for such agreements, but does not state why such an agreement is appropriate in this case. When considering the context of the evidence provided, a secret compromise agreement is less justifiable. It is not appropriate for covering up circumstances that seriously affect the ratepayers of Craven. (We have been given no compelling evidence that the authority were orchestrating a so-called cover up. Craven presented evidence, which we accept, that it was within the council’s power to enter into the agreement and that it followed the appropriate procedures. Further, the agreement was approved by internal audit. It is not our task in this case (nor was it the Commissioner’s) to consider the appropriateness of a compromise agreement. Our task is to consider whether the agreement should be disclosed.) b. Consequences of Disclosure: unjustified harm or distress i. The Commissioner’s supposition that disclosure may pose a risk to the ex- CEO’s chances of promotion or employment is unsubstantiated and seems to have been drawn from air. It is difficult to imagine that a person employed as the head and public face of a large council could have her emotional wellbeing affected by the release of details of her severance pay. In the light of the compliments given to her, it does not seem possible that anything in the agreement can affect the future prospects of the subject or affect her wellbeing. Either that, or the public is being deliberately misled. ii. The fact that some information is in the public domain should make it even more essential to publish the full story to quell rumour. c. Reasonable Expectations Context: i. The Commissioner did not take into account the background to the subject’s departure, which is relevant in considering what would be the CEO’s reasonable expectations. It must have made her aware that the public had a right to know the circumstances of her departure and that the District Auditor would comment on her period in office. It was unreasonable for her to expect that she should be granted privacy in circumstances such as: 1. The Audit Commission’s audit, including item 63 (see para.14(b)(v), and the other evidence submitted elaborates on the way the council’s finances fell into chaos during ex-CEO’s period as Chief Executive. The council, financed by the public, had been led to the - 17 - EA/2010/0095edge of bankruptcy, had found it difficult to perform because of tensions and had found it necessary to change senior management including the Chief Executive. Given the mistrust described, it is difficult to imagine a situation of more legitimate public interest. 2. The effects of the stringent measures the council has had to take because of its disastrous financial position at the end of the ex- CEO’s her time in office. Confidentiality: ii. Much is made of the secrecy clause to which both parties agreed saying that the subject could automatically expect non-disclosure. The Commissioner argues as though non-disclosure was automatically ensured by the secrecy clause, and the Complainant submits that he is wrong. The Commissioner’s guidance on s.40 FOIA warns authorities: “it is not possible to avoid your duties under the FOIA by not telling individuals that their data may be disclosed, or by stating that data will not be disclosed, and then arguing that disclosure would be unwarranted and unfair.” 6 The subject might have thought that a secrecy clause made disclosure impossible, but that conclusion is not automatic and can be overruled where circumstances allow. iii. The Baker case makes clear that the test is not what the subject actually expected, but what the subject could reasonably expect. The case states that the FOIA modifies the expectations that individuals can reasonably expect secrecy, “especially where the information relates to the performance of public duties or the expenditure of public money”. (We note that the Appellant is quoting from what the Commissioner’s arguments in that case rather than the Tribunal’s actual decision.) Seniority of CEO: iv. As a senior employee of the Council, the ex-CEO should reasonably have expected that the agreement would or may be disclosed to the public under FOIA. The Commissioner’s guidance states: “The more senior a person is, the less likely it is that disclosing information about their public duties will be unwarranted or unfair. Information about a senior official’s public life should generally be disclosed unless it would put them at risk, or unless it also reveals details of the private lives of other people (eg the official’s family).”” 7 . To overcome this guidance, the Commissioner must be convinced that there are circumstances present which make disclosure particularly harmful, and he has been unable to do this, merely stating that disclosure “might well” harm her. He also admits that evidence of this is difficult to produce. Absent of good reason to the contrary, the guidelines should be followed. Otherwise it is difficult to understand why it is put to the public. v. The compliments paid to the subject publicly must indicate that any disclosure cannot be unreasonable on the grounds of unfairness. If these compliments are unfounded it would appear that the Council is deliberately misleading the public. 6 Information Commissioner’s Office: Awareness Guidance 1:“The exemption for personal information” Nov08, p.8 http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/awareness_guidance%20_1_%20personal_i nformation_v2.pdf 7 ibid. - 18 - EA/2010/0095d. Private versus Public Life: i. It is not argued, or expected, that disclosure will relate to the subject’s private or family life. It cannot be accepted that details relating to pension contributions, tax codes etc. relate to a person’s private life such that the whole agreement is exempt from disclosure. They quite clearly relate to her public duties under the heading of “senior pay in the public sector” referred to in the Audit Commission’s report. (We found the Appellant’s argument difficult to follow. We do not see how details on a person’s tax code can be said to pertain to public duties.) e. Data Subject’s rights and freedoms balanced against the legitimate interests in disclosure i. The public is entitled to know when its governance has been destabilised and what steps are being taken to restore stability. This entitlement must take priority over the interests of a person whose conduct was thought (both by the Council and the District Auditor) to have led to such instability. ii. (Further arguments are set out below in relation to the legitimate interest test.) The Law 40. In construing the first DPP, the Tribunal notes and applies the comments by Lord Hope in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] 1 WLR 1550 (referring to the equivalent exemption in the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (‘FOISA’)): “In my opinion there is no presumption in favour of the release of personal data under the general obligation that FOISA lays down. The references which that Act makes the provisions of DPA 1998 must be understood in the light of the legislative purpose of that Act, which was to implement Council Directive 95/46/EC. The guiding principle is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data....” (Para. 7) 41. When determining what is fair, we are to have regard to how the information was obtained and whether the person from whom it was obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose for its processing.(See para.26 above.) We therefore accept that the reasonable expectations of the ex-CEO and possible consequences of disclosure for her are relevant factors to consider. Our Findings 42. In short, the requested agreement falls within a category of what might be termed “personnel matters” and as such, there is a strong expectation of privacy. Therefore, for most of the terms of the agreement, we consider it a reasonable expectation that the information would not be disclosed and that to do so would be unfair. However, we would not regard it as reasonable for the ex-CEO (or the council) to expect that certain information relating to the use of public funds, to be hidden from public gaze by virtue of a confidentiality clause agreed between them. This is because of the context described below and the fact that the ex-CEO was the most senior officer of the council. 43. The following factors are pertinent to our findings: a. Privacy: i. There is no presumption in favour of releasing personal data. - 19 - EA/2010/0095ii. A person in public office should expect their public actions and work duties to be subject to greater scrutiny than their private lives. However, we accept that there is a category of data - information that might belong in a personnel file within the human resources department of a public authority, such as pension contributions and tax codes - that comes into existence whilst acting in one’s professional capacity, which is nevertheless inherently private and would attract a very strong expectation of privacy and protection from the public gaze. (We note that disclosure under the FOIA is considered disclosure to the world at large and so might be considered particularly intrusive). A compromise agreement entered into with employers is private in nature and would fit within this category. b. Seniority: A senior person in public office should expect their public actions to be subject to greater scrutiny than a more junior official. In this case, the ex-CEO was the most senior officer in the council, reporting to the leader of the council. c. Context: To consider whether expectations are “reasonable”, they must be seen within their context. We note: i. The ex-CEO left office with the council finances in disarray. Auditors described the period prior to her leaving, as a financial crisis. The 2007/08 audit describes the finance department as having been inadequate and failing to meet certain minimum requirements. Instead of the budgeted underspend, there was a £800,000 overspend and a need to save £2.5M. We would anticipate the measures needed to curtail the budget would impact on the authority’s ability to deliver services; staff; taxpayers and residents. The local press described the situation as a catastrophe and were keen to find out what was going on and who to blame. ii. At the time of the request, it was known that compromise agreements were being used in the public sector. There was (and still is) public interest in the remuneration levels of top council officials and increasing openness in this area. There was an interest in knowing whether public authorities were “rewarding failure” through early contract termination payments. (We do not imply that Craven did reward failure or that the ex-CEO had in any way failed. There was clearly a breakdown in relationships and an interest in finding out whether this was happening there.). iii. Within the context described here, we do not find the argument about timing (in para. 38(b)(vii) above) compelling. d. The Information: ie the terms of the agreement: i. Confidentiality: CEO’s Expectations: Curiously, it was only after the panel’s further questions, that the Additional Party submitted a witness statement from the ex-CEO. In this she stated that without the protection of the confidentiality clause within the agreement, she would not have entered into the agreement. However, the ex-CEO had received independent legal advice in entering into the agreement, and so presumably would have been aware of FOIA. Even if she were not, as the Commissioner’s guidance on s.40 FOIA points out: “…in the absence of other factors disclosure will not be automatically unwarranted or unfair just because the person was not 8 aware of the possibility of disclosure.” ii. The Commissioner’s guidance also warns authorities that: “it is not possible to avoid your duties under the FOIA by not telling individuals that 8 Ibid. - 20 - EA/2010/0095their data may be disclosed, or by stating that data will not be disclosed, and then arguing that disclosure would be unwarranted and unfair.” 9 iii. The section 45 Code of Practice which the Commissioner referred to (see paragraph 38(b)(iii) above) also warns that the public authority and contractor should be aware of the limits placed by the FOIA on the enforceability of confidentiality clauses. We accept that the code is focused predominantly on contracts with third party contractors. However, we consider that the principle remains - although where the data falls within the personnel category, it may very well fall within the absolute exemption within the FOIA. iv. We were referred to paragraph 24 of the Wilson decision, where the Tribunal states that the existence of a confidentiality agreement would give rise to a reasonable expectation that no further information would be released. However, that statement was made as a general observation; this Tribunal is not bound by the decision; and in any event, the facts differ. We do agree that generally, we would not anticipate that information contained within a compromise agreement would be disclosed. v. The Commissioner also considered the value of compromise agreements more generally. This does not appear relevant to whether disclosure would be unfair to the data subject. Arguably, it is relevant in considering the legitimate interests of the public, discussed below. e. Consequences of Disclosure for the Data Subject: Brief assertions were made that the consequences of disclosure would be deleterious to the subject’s emotional wellbeing and/or career. However, they were unsubstantiated and not justified to any satisfactory level. Compromise agreements are commonly used and we would not see why disclosure of, say, their common terms would cause damage. We accept that disclosure of the information might cause a level of mischief but not to a significant degree. f. The Commissioner considered as a further factor, the data subject’s rights and freedoms when balanced against the legitimate interests in disclosure. Given the same arguments will apply in relation to the legitimate interest test, we deal with those points below, instead. D. Would processing be lawful? Submissions 44. In closed submissions, the Additional Party and Commissioner argued that disclosure would be unlawful. They based this on the confidentiality clause within the agreement. After the hearing that the Additional Party served an open witness statement that openly referred to the existence of the confidentiality clause within the agreement. In view of this late statement, we see no justification for the arguments being kept confidential, and we deal with them below. We have not sought the Appellant’s submissions in reply to the arguments. In view of the lack of analysis presented, we consider this unnecessary. 45. The Additional Party argued that since the Compromise Agreement contains a valid confidentiality clause, disclosure of the personal data contained in the agreement would be unlawful. However, when asked whether redaction was possible, it agreed that it would be. 46. The Commissioner also argued that disclosure would be unlawful because it would breach the terms of the confidentiality clause, as it appeared to remain valid and legally binding on the two parties to the Agreement. (This was despite its statement in para.38(b)(v)). 9 Ibid. - 21 - EA/2010/0095Our Findings 47. We do not find the arguments that processing would be unlawful at all persuasive. Whilst the first DPP requires that information be processed “lawfully”, this is not defined in the Act. However, it seems to mean that information may not be processed when the law does not allow it, as opposed to when two parties have entered into a voluntary agreement not to disclose the information. 48. Perhaps the parties were seeking to argue that disclosure would be a breach of confidence. However, they did not enunciate this - nor why such quality of confidence would be inherent rather than simply agreed; nor why such arguments were not more properly put within the absolute exemption in s.41 FOIA. 10 E. Does Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 DPA 11 apply? The Law 49. We adopt the reasoning in Baker, that condition 6 of Schedule 2 is satisfied if the legitimate interests of the public outweigh those of the ex-CEO in protecting her personal data: “...Paragraph 6 requires a consideration of the balance between: (i) the legitimate interests of those to whom the data would be disclosed which in this context are members of the public (section 40 (3)(a)); and (ii) prejudice to the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subjects which in this case are MPs. However because the processing must be ‘necessary’ for the legitimate interests of members of the public to apply we find that only where (i) outweighs or is greater than (ii) should the personal data be disclosed.” (Para 90). 50. In connection with necessity, we are assisted by the reasoning in Leapman: “…Interference with private life can only be justified where it is in accordance with the law, is necessary in a democratic society for the pursuit of legitimate aims, and is not disproportionate to the objective pursued… the Court identified the essential questions as whether there was an interference with private life, whether the interference was justified by a legitimate aim, and whether the interference was necessary to achieve the legitimate aim pursued, i.e., whether a pressing social need was involved and the measure employed was proportionate to the aim (paragraphs 73-94)… (A) whether the legitimate aims pursued by the applicants can be achieved by means that interfere less with the privacy of the MPs (and, so far as affected, their families or other individuals), (B) if we are satisfied that the aims cannot be achieved by means that involve less interference, whether the disclosure would have an excessive or disproportionate adverse effect on the legitimate interests of the MPs (or anyone else)….” (Para.s 59-60 – Emphasis added). Our findings 51. The main legitimate interests of the requester or members of the public raised in this appeal can be summarized as follows: Transparency and Public Funds: a. The parties acknowledge a strong interest in the public knowing the terms of the Compromise Agreement and how much public money was spent. The Appellant 10 We note that we have already discussed above whether the presence of the confidentiality clause might have meant that processing would be unfair. 11 Para. 27 above sets out this provision. - 22 - EA/2010/0095considers that transparency is important to the democratic process to ensure the public are able to exercise a properly informed vote, and that the public have a right to know how its money is being expended - particularly at a time of financial failings. (We consider this interest to be particularly strong to the extent it concerns knowing whether senior officials are being awarded large pay-offs.) b. In assessing the weight of this, we considered the Commissioner’s arguments that there is a countervailing strong public interest in preserving the use of such agreements as vehicles for ending employer/employee relationships. The Audit Commission’s report was cited to illustrate the interest in maintaining the confidentiality of compromise agreements because they may serve to reduce the size and number of severance payments; ease quick departures where there are dysfunctional relationships and therefore increase efficiencies. (We presume this is partly based on a calculation that settling a dispute with an outgoing employee is generally more economical than allowing the dispute to progress through the court. However, the report also states that not all such settlements are justified, with some competent chief executives losing their jobs needlessly, and less effective individuals being paid-off rather than dismissed. The commission called for, amongst other things, all deals to be more transparent, scrutinised by remuneration committees, and details published shortly after they are agreed. We do accept that there is a public benefit to compromise agreements that serve to draw a line on dysfunctional relationships and bring clarity as to the costs of doing so. However, we do not accept that if the outgoing employee were to know that financial details of their severance agreement were to be made public, they would instead always opt to continue with their dispute in court instead. Whilst it is possible that for some confidentiality is the predominant benefit, there are other advantages. The employees may prefer the speed, lesser stress and certainty of result achieved through the out of court settlement.) c. The Appellant expressed a concern that the public should be able to be assured that severance agreements were not used to cover up defects in public administration. (We accept that there is a strong public interest in knowing whether the authority was justified in reaching a settlement or whether instead an agreement has been entered into to bury issues or reward failure. This is particularly when its competency in financial management has been brought into question. However, we would anticipate that disclosure of most of the terms of a standard settlement agreement would not enlighten the reader as to whether the settlement was justified. Assurance from the district auditor in the terms repeated above might be of greater assistance. (See paragraph 16 above). 52. The main prejudices to the rights, freedoms or legitimate interests of the ex-CEO raised in this appeal can be summarized as follows: a. Privacy: the Compromise Agreement is private in nature and generally an employee ought to be able to expect it to be treated confidentially. b. Consequences to the data subject of disclosure: As discussed above, we did not find any compelling evidence that the disclosure would cause harm, although it is possible that it could cause mischief that we are unable to predict. 53. Having considered all these interests and taking into account the particular circumstances that led to the settlement , we find that the legitimate interests of members of the public outweigh the prejudice to the rights, freedoms or legitimate interests of the ex-CEO only to the extent that the information concerns the use of public funds - either through Craven being exposed or potentially exposed to make payments to her. We note that some information relating to the financial details of the settlement is in the public domain. (See para 16b). The Appellant has argued that the public interests can only be satisfied by a - 23 - EA/2010/0095disclosure of all the terms of the Compromise Agreement, and not merely the amount of compensation paid. He argued that: “only full disclosure can address the serious inadequacies of matters surrounding the departure from office of the data subject at a time when the finances of Craven DC had been decimated under her period of accountability.” However, he did not fully explain why, and we disagree. 54. It is clear that although the requested disclosure pertains to information that came into existence as a result of public office, it is information belonging to the personnel files. Therefore if it were to be disclosed, this would interfere with the ex-CEO’s privacy. In accordance with paragraph 50 above, any such interference must be justified by a legitimate aim or pressing social need. In this case, the strongest need would be to know the how much of public funds were expended for senior staff in the context of a council whose financial affairs had caused great public concern. There are also needs to know that agreements are not used to bury failings of councils or poor management; and that the settlement was justified. However, as discussed above, we do not consider that disclosure would serve that need, and certainly not more so than the less intrusive method of an assurance from the district auditor. We are satisfied that disclosure of the financial details of the settlement would not have an excessive or disproportionate adverse effect on the legitimate interests of the ex-CEO. 55. Whilst not a factor informing our decision, we note we were told that within local government, there is a now a requirement for authorities to publish in their statement of accounts the individual financial details of any severance payments to all senior officers earning over £50,000. Those earning over £150,000 are to be identified by name, with all others by post title. 56. The parties made reference to the decisions in Waugh and Wilson. In both cases the requests were not for comparable information. Further, in the former the severance sum had already been disclosed. In the latter, the employee does not appear to have been of a similar level of seniority. In any event, we are not be obliged to follow those decisions. Conclusion and remedy 57. For the reasons set out above, we find that Craven must provide the information identified in the substituted decision notice. 58. Our decision is unanimous.

The remainder of the disputed information does fall within the exemption in section 40(2) of FOIA and the public authority is entitled to withhold it from disclosure. Action Required The Department for Employment and Learning must now disclose to the Requestor the information identified relating to Derek Martin, with the names of other identified persons redacted, to ensure compliance. The authority must do so within 35 calendar days from the date of this Substituted Decision Notice. Dated this 17 November 2010 Signed Annabel Pilling Judge 3Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This is an Appeal by Ms Alison Ince against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the ‘Commissioner’) dated 25 March 2010. The Decision Notice relates to a request for information made by Ms Ince to the Department for Employment and Learning (the ‘DEL’) under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ‘FOIA’). 2. The disputed information in this case is personal data as defined in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the ‘DPA’) and was withheld under the exemption provided for in section 40(2) of FOIA by virtue of section 40(3)(a)(i) of FOIA, on the basis that disclosure would contravene one of the data protection principles. Background 3. Between 1992 and 1999 Ms Ince was in employment with a further education establishment in Northern Ireland (the ‘Institute’). She was dismissed June 1999. The Institute later conceded liability for unfair dismissal before an Industrial Tribunal in 2006. 4. The Industrial Tribunal heard evidence over the course of 25 days to decide remedy; the main issue was Ms Ince’s alleged contributory fault. This was not accepted by the Tribunal to the extent alleged and Mrs Ince was given a substantial award. As part of its effort to determine the extent of any alleged contributory fault, the Industrial Tribunal was asked to consider Ms Ince’s allegations of harassment and bullying in the workplace and whether the course of disciplinary action taken against her amounted to a form of victimisation for disclosure she claimed she made about the alleged fraudulent activity of one of her line managers. Having considered the evidence provided over the course of the hearing, the Industrial Tribunal rejected Ms Ince’s claim that her treatment by the Institute amounted to victimisation by reason 45. The allegations of fraud concern events in June 1997 and, since being brought to the attention of a number of public bodies in the period 2002-2004, have been investigated by the Financial Audit and Support Team (FAST) of the DEL, and considered twice by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). No charges have been brought or are anticipated, no disciplinary action has been taken against any individual and no further investigation has been deemed warranted on current evidence. Ms Ince continues to pursue her allegations of fraud. 6. The disputed information in this case concerns records of interviews with individuals concerning these allegations of fraud. The request for information 7. By e-mail dated 18 October 2007 Ms Ince made the following request for information to the DEL in respect of her allegations of fraud at the Institute: I wish to know the following: 1 Who were the four other personnel named by Ms Ince? 2 When were they interviewed? 3 Where were they interviewed? 4 By whom were they interviewed? 5 What questions were put to them? 6 What answers did they give? 7 Was the information gleaned passed on to any other person/organisation? If so, to whom and when? 58 What steps, if any, did the Department take to ascertain the accuracy of the information gleaned? I also wish to have a copy of the two evidence packs which were compiled and referred to the Fraud Squad for assessment. 8. On 12 November 2007 the DEL responded to each of the questions in turn. It answered questions 2, 4, 7 and 8 but in relation to the other questions it indicated that it held the requested information, but withheld it on the basis that it was exempt from disclosure under section 40(2) of FOIA; that is, the information was personal data and its disclosure would breach the first data protection principle set out in the Data Protection Act (the ‘DPA’). It considered that the information contained within the two evidence packs had been provided in confidence and therefore fell within the exemption in section 41 of FOIA. 9. Ms Ince was dissatisfied with the response and requested an internal review on 19 November 2007. She argued that DEL had misapplied sections 40 and 41 of FOIA and stated that much of the information was already in the public domain. 10. On 2 January 2008 the DEL responded to the request for an internal review. It provided more detailed reasons as to why it considered that disclosure of this information would breach the first data protection principle and upheld the initial decision that the information requested is exempt through the provisions of section 40(2) of FOIA. It did however provide the two evidence packs with some information redacted. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 11. Ms Ince contacted the Commissioner on 11 January 2008 to complain about the way her request had been handled. In particular she explained that she considered DEL misapplied the exemptions in section 40 and 41 of FOIA in contravention of the Commissioner’s 612. The Commissioner then investigated the substantive complaint, receiving additional information from Ms Ince and DEL. 13. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, DEL released information concerning the location where one of the interviews had been held but maintained that it did not in fact hold any further information for question 3. In respect of question 5, DEL informed Ms Ince that no questions were put to three of the interviewees but the fourth interviewee was invited to comment on two specific areas of investigation. Ms Ince was informed that the information was not held for three of the interviewees but the questions put to one interviewee were withheld relying on section 40(2) of FOIA. 14. The Commissioner issued a Decision Notice on 25 March 2010. 15. The Commissioner upheld the application of section 40(2) of FOIA to the disputed information as it was the personal data of the data subjects within the meaning of section 1(1) of the DPA and that disclosure would breach the first data protection principle (that data should be processed fairly and lawfully). The Commissioner also determined that some of the information is exempt under section 40(1) of FOIA because it is the personal data of Ms Ince and the DPA provides for an alternative route of access. 1 16. The Commissioner also found a number of procedural breaches of the FOIA, which are not the subject of any appeal. The Appeal to the Tribunal 17. Ms Ince appealed to the Tribunal on 6 May 2010. 1 However, the Commissioner does not believe that it is likely the DEL could disclose the information pursuant to a subject access request without breaching section 7(4) DPA. 718. The issue raised in the grounds of appeal is whether disclosure of the disputed information would breach the data protection principles. 19. The Appeal has been determined following a hearing on 20 October 2010. Ms Ince appeared via a video-link. The Tribunal was provided with an agreed bundle of documents and written submissions from both Ms Ince and the Commissioner. The Tribunal heard oral submissions from Ms Ince and Mr Capewell, with Ms Ince having the opportunity to reply to Mr Capewell‘s submissions. 20. In addition, the Tribunal was provided with a Closed bundle of documents. This bundle included the disputed information. This was not made available to Ms Ince, as to disclose it to her would defeat the purpose of this Appeal. For the same reason, the Tribunal held a short Closed session during the hearing in order to ask questions of Mr Capewell on behalf of the Commissioner that related to the content of the disputed information. 21. During the course of Ms Ince’s reply to Mr Capewell’s submissions, she submitted that Derek Martin, one of the individuals whose personal data had been withheld by DEL, denied that he had been contacted to ascertain whether he consented to that data being disclosed or not, that he did consent to disclosure and that he was present with Ms Ince during this hearing. A statement had been provided in the agreed bundle of documents from Derek Martin but this did not deal with the issue of consent. The Commissioner had indicated that the content of the witness statement was not challenged and Mr Martin was not required to attend to give evidence before the Tribunal. The Tribunal had drawn Ms Ince’s attention to the fact that the issue of consent had not been addressed in the statement but she did not seek to submit any additional evidence. 22. It was therefore of no little concern to the Tribunal that such a significant issue had not only been disregarded by Ms Ince but had been brought up only during her reply submissions. In order to deal 823. Mr Martin confirmed that he had given evidence before the Industrial Tribunal and that evidence, save for the naming of other individuals, was the same as was in the disputed information relating to him in this case. He gave his consent for his personal data to be disclosed save for the redaction of the names of those other individuals. 24. Although we may not refer to every document in this Decision, we have considered all the material placed before us. The Powers of the Tribunal 25. The Tribunal’s powers in relation to appeals under section 57 of the FOIA are set out in section 58 of the FOIA, as follows: (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers- (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 926. The starting point for the Tribunal is the Decision Notice of the Commissioner but the Tribunal also receives and hears evidence, which is not limited to the material that was before the Commissioner. The Tribunal, having considered the evidence (and it is not bound by strict rules of evidence), may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner and consider the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law because of those different facts. Nevertheless, if the facts are not in dispute, the Tribunal must consider whether FOIA has been applied correctly. If the facts are decided differently by the Tribunal, or the Tribunal comes to a different conclusion based on the same facts, that will involve a finding that the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. 27. The question of whether the exemption in section 40(2)(a) of FOIA is engaged, is a question of law based upon the analysis of the facts. This is not a case where the Commissioner was required to exercise his discretion. The Legal Framework 28. Under section 1(1) of FOIA, any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled, subject to other provisions of the Act, (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds the information requested, and (b) if so, to have that information communicated to him. 29. The section 1(1)(b) duty of the public authority to provide the information requested will not apply where the information is exempt by virtue of any provision of Part II of FOIA. The exemptions provided for under Part II fall into two classes: absolute exemptions and qualified exemptions. Where the information is subject to a qualified exemption, it will only be exempt from disclosure if, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (section 2(2)(b)). Section 40(2)(a) of FOIA is an absolute exemption. Information that falls within 1030. The issue for determination in this Appeal is whether the disputed information is exempt under section 40(2) of FOIA. 31. The relevant part of section 40(2) of FOIA provides: (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if- (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is – (a) In a case where the information falls within any of the paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ‘data’ in section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene – (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress)….. 32. Section 1(1) of the DPA defines “personal data”: “..data which relates to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller.” 33. There is no dispute that the disputed information, held by the DEL as the data controller, constitutes “personal data”. 1134. Under section 40(2), personal data of third parties is exempt if disclosure would breach any of the data protection principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1 of the DPA (as interpreted in accordance with Part II of Schedule 1), or section 10 of the DPA (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress). 35. The data protection principles regulate the way in which a “data controller” (in this instance, the DEL) must “process” personal data. The word “process” is defined in section 1(1) of the DPA and includes: “disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available.” 36. The first data protection principle provides: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met. 37. There are three parts to the first data protection principle: (i) whether the processing (here, disclosure) of the information would be ‘fair’; (ii) whether the processing would be ‘lawful’; and (iii) whether there is at least one relevant condition for processing. (The conditions for processing are set out in Schedule 2 DPA 2 ) 2 For the processing of sensitive personal data at least one condition from Schedule 3 must also be met. The disputed information in this case is personal data not sensitive personal data. 1238. So far as the second requirement of the first data protection principle is concerned, the DPA does not specify what is meant by “lawful” processing. We consider that disclosure where that disclosure is prohibited by statute would certainly not be lawful processing. Disclosure of information that would give rise to a civil liability, for example, because it would amount to a breach of confidence, also might not constitute lawful processing. In this Appeal, no party has argued that disclosure of the disputed information would be unlawful. 39. The issues before the Tribunal are therefore- (i) whether the processing would be fair; (ii) and, if so, is at least one of the relevant conditions for processing in Schedule 2 DPA met. Submissions and analysis 40. There is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom of information and the objective of protecting personal data. It has been observed that section 40(2) of FOIA is a “complex provision” 3 . There is no presumption that openness and transparency of the activities of public authorities should take priority over personal privacy. In the words of Lord Hope of Craighead in Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner 4 (referring to the equivalent provisions in the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (the ‘FOISA’): “In my opinion there is no presumption in favour of the release of personal data under the general obligation that FOISA lays down. The references which that Act makes to provisions of DPA 1998 must be understood in the light of the legislative purposes of that Act, which was to implement Council Directive 95/46/EC. The guiding principle is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, and in particular 3 Blake v Information Commissioner and Wiltshire County Council EA/2009/0026 4 [2008] UKHL 47 13their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data….” Fair processing 41. Part II of Schedule 1 of the DPA includes matters to be taken into account in interpreting the data protection principles. Paragraphs 1 to 4 of Part II of Schedule 1 provide interpretive guidance as to the requirement to process fairly. Paragraph 1 is concerned with the manner in which the data are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom the data are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed; Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 set out circumstances in which personal data are either not to be treated as processed fairly or to be treated as processed fairly, and relate to requirements to provide certain information to data subjects. These matters are not exhaustive and the test of fairness is a general one and is not confined to a consideration of whether those requirements have been met. Even where there is compliance with paragraph 2 then the processing may still be unfair on general grounds (Johnson v Medical Defence Union 5 ) No party directly addressed Part II of Schedule 1, either in submissions or in evidence, but we have taken these matters into account when considering the issue of fairness in this case. 42. Ms Ince, who was unrepresented in this Appeal, disagrees with the weight given by the Commissioner to the arguments in favour of disclosure in respect of four factors and submits that he should have concluded that these factors supported disclosure of the disputed information: (i) The information relates to the individual’s public rather than private life. 5 [2006] EWHC 321 (Ch) paragraph 114 onwards. 14(ii) Any likely harm or distress that might be caused to the individuals by disclosure of the disputed information. (iii) The objection of the interviewees. (iv) The reasonable expectations of the interviewees. The information relates to the individual’s public rather than private life. 43. Ms Ince submits that the disputed information relates to the individual’s public and not private lives and suggested that anything that did not relate to public life should be redacted. She submits that the work of public employees should be open to proper scrutiny by the public for whom they work and by whom they are paid. 44. In particular, Ms Ince submits that the nature of the further education sector is such that most staff have roles that are, to a greater or lesser extent, public facing and that some at least of the people she named to DEL as being able to support her allegations of fraud were in relatively senior positions. 45. The Commissioner submits that not all information relating to an employee of a public authority will be public information and that there will be aspects of employment which are private and over which one would expect to have a certain level of confidentiality. In this instance, while it relates indirectly to the professional roles of the individuals, the disputed information does not relate to a public aspect of their employment but amounted to a personally held opinion. 46. In order to avoid revealing personal data, it is not possible to confirm that the four people Ms Ince named to DEL as being able to substantiate her allegations of fraud are the four individuals whose interviews form the disputed information in this case. 1547. We agree with Ms Ince that a distinction can be drawn between the information which senior staff should expect to have disclosed about them compared to what information junior staff should expect to have disclosed about them. The rationale for this distinction is that the more senior a member of staff is, the more likely it is that they will be responsible for making influential policy decisions and/or decisions related to the expenditure of significant amounts of public funds. 48. Along with other differently constituted panels of this Tribunal, we consider that when assessing whether processing would be fair, where data subjects carry out public functions, hold elective office or spend public funds, there must be greater scrutiny over their public actions than in respect of their private lives. We therefore disagree with Ms Ince’s submission that everything a public employee says or does is public information and that disclosure of it could never be unfair. 49. In this case, the disputed information goes beyond information directly concerning the individual’s public role or decision making process and relates to personal views and opinions on the allegations of fraud in1997 made by Ms Ince. Two of us considered that the disputed information in the case related to the individual’s employment but was not information so directly connected with their public role that its disclosure would automatically be fair. One member of the Panel considered that the disputed information was “hybrid” information in that it was impossible to fully separate the public information from the private information. We considered whether it might be possible to redact the disputed information in some way but concluded that it would not be feasible having regard to its contents. 50. We concluded that simply because the information emanates from an employee of a public authority does not automatically make disclosure fair. The Commissioner was right to consider this factor and we consider that he gave it appropriate weight in deciding whether the 16Any likely harm or distress that might be caused to the individuals by disclosure of the disputed information. 51. Ms Ince submits that the Commissioner’s own Guidance makes it clear that the focus should be on harm or distress that might be caused in a personal capacity and that “a risk of embarrassment or public criticism over administrative decisions, or the interests of a public authority itself rather than the individual concerned, should not be taken into account.” 52. As a result of the allegations being aired during the Industrial Tribunal case, Ms Ince submits that the nature of the allegations and the names of those she alleged committed the fraud have already been made public. She submits that nothing in the disputed information is therefore likely to cause any further distress to the interviewees and, even if it were likely to do so, it is unlikely to be in a personal capacity. 53. The Commissioner submits that while some of the staff might expect that their role would be open to public scrutiny, the disputed information would not provide that scrutiny and that disclosure of the fact they were interviewed in respect of allegations of fraud would cause them distress. He submits that his consideration was not whether the DEL would suffer embarrassment or distress, but the individuals whose personal data would be disclosed. 54. Again, it is not possible for us to confirm that the four people Ms Ince named to DEL as being able to substantiate her allegations of fraud are the four individuals whose interviews form the disputed information in this case nor, save for Derek Martin, whether they are individuals who were named in any capacity during the Industrial Tribunal case in 2006. Ms Ince concedes that the fact the individuals were interviewed by DEL about her allegations of fraud could not have been in the public domain as she was not aware until 2007 that anyone other than Derek Martin 1755. What is clear from the papers provided to us in the agreed bundle, is that Ms Ince had approached at least two individuals in advance of the Industrial Tribunal hearing with a view to calling them as witnesses in support of her case and that they declined, with one indicating that any further approach by Ms Ince would lead to her seeking legal advice. We have seen letters written by Ms Ince of an inflammatory nature that must have caused distress to the recipients, likening a reluctance to give evidence of the injustice suffered by Ms Ince at the Institute to the behaviour of those who did not speak out against the injustice caused to Jews being sent to the gas chamber. 56. We agree with the Commissioner’s conclusion that disclosure of the disputed information would be likely to cause distress to the individuals, save for Mr Martin who gave evidence to the contrary before us. 57. We consider that there is a real likelihood of harm or distress being caused by Ms Ince specifically. We have reached this conclusion in light of what we consider to be Ms Ince’s disproportionate actions in pursuing her aims in the past by attempting to secure support at the Industrial Tribunal hearing and also in light of her indication before us that she intended to pursue private prosecutions against these individuals and needs these interviews to challenge the evidence that they might give at some future date. 58. We also consider that there is a real likelihood of harm or distress being caused by disclosure generally. In late 2005 or early 2006 these individuals were asked questions or asked to comment in relation to an alleged fraud committed in June 1997. There have been a number of investigations by proper authorities into the allegation of fraud made by 18The objection of the interviewees. 59. Ms Ince concedes that the objection of the interviewees is a relevant consideration but submits that the Commissioner attached too much significance to this factor in deciding whether disclosure would be fair. She submits that given her other arguments, the other circumstances of the case create a sufficiently compelling argument for disclosure to outweigh the interviewees’ objections. 60. The Commissioner submits that the objection of the individuals concerned was only one factor taken into consideration and that when considering whether disclosure would breach the first data protection principle he took into account the circumstances of the case, in particular the following factors: (i) they have confirmed they do not wish their identity to be known; (ii) they were provided with an assurance of confidentiality; (iii) they had a reasonable expectation that the information would be kept confidential, other than as part of the fraud investigation (e.g. including an investigation by the police); (iv) it is likely that the disclosure of the information would cause distress to those concerned; (v) if the withheld information were to be disclosed it would have the effect of seriously undermining confidence for staff involved in future investigations. 1961. We consider that the Commissioner did not give disproportionate weight to the objections of the individuals concerned when deciding whether disclosure would be fair but that it was one of the factors he took into account. 62. Save for Derek Martin who no longer objects to disclosure, we are satisfied that there is no evidence to suggest that the objections of the individuals concerned has altered. Three of the four interviewees were asked if they would consent to the disputed information being disclosed pursuant to a request made under FOIA. None asked gave their consent and expressed the expectation that their names and information provided by them would be kept confidential. The fourth individual could not be contacted but we do not consider that we can infer no objection, rather, because this is but one of the factors we must take into consideration, we infer that the individual’s wishes remained as indicated previously. The reasonable expectations of the interviewees 63. Ms Ince again concedes that the reasonable expectations of the individual as to whether his or her information would be disclosed is a relevant consideration. She submits that DEL should not have given and did not have the authority to give any assurance that the information provided by the individuals would be kept confidential, as the subject matter related to alleged fraud, the alleged commission of a criminal offence. 64. The Commissioner submits that the individuals were interviewed for the “…sole purpose of investigating allegations of fraud with an explicit assurance that any information would be treated confidentially.” He also relies on the witness statement of Derek Martin who stated that Ms Ince herself had obtained a “guarantee that neither my identity nor my testimony would be revealed to anyone.” 2065. He submits that he properly took these factors into account when considering the expectation of the interviewees and that there was clearly an expectation that the information was provided to DEL in confidence. 66. The Commissioner urges us to remember that the allegations of fraud are mere allegations and remain so until proven. He submits that this would therefore be a factor in favour of keeping the disputed information, obtained during the investigation of these allegations, confidential. 67. We agree with the Commissioner’s submissions. We are satisfied on the evidence we have seen, including the disputed information itself, that the individuals held the reasonable expectation that the information would be kept confidential. Whether DEL should have given the assurance of confidentiality is irrelevant; what is relevant is the fact that it was given and that the individuals relied upon that assurance. 68. Additionally, we were concerned that there is no evidence that the disputed information accurately reflects what was said by the individual or whether it is accepted by the individual as the disputed information is in the form of a document apparently transcribed by a third party and contains no signature by any of the individuals to that effect. Additional factors to be considered in deciding whether the processing would be fair 69. Ms Ince also submits that there are common law public interest considerations that should have been considered by DEL and by the Commissioner. In particular she submits that: a) there is a legitimate public interest in disclosure because there is a heightened public interest in openness regarding DEL’s failure to address allegations of fraud within the further education sector robustly; and 21b) there is an argument for disclosure that would be capable of reversing the normal presumption in favour of withholding information “if it would highlight any misconduct, wrongdoing or risk to the public.” 70. The Commissioner concedes that there is a legitimate public interest in general terms of pursuing allegations of fraud committed by public authorities. However, he submits that the disputed information in this case would not assist in that aim; there have been a number of investigations through the proper channels by established bodies, including the matter being passed to the police on two occasions. 71. While we agree that the fact of fraud within the further education sector in Northern Ireland had led to a heightened public interest, we are not satisfied that the disputed information in this case contains information of the sort that is relevant to that public interest. Ms Ince argues that the disputed information would show that DEL did not conduct a rigorous and effective investigation into the fraud but we must consider that argument in light of the subsequent, and repeated, investigations by other appropriate bodies on the evidence presented and allegations made by Ms Ince. We echo the comments made by the Industrial Tribunal that this Tribunal is also not the appropriate vehicle to review or second guess the findings of the departmental and police investigations into allegations of fraud. Our Findings 72. In deciding whether the processing is fair, we have considered all the factors addressed in detail above. We consider that the legitimate interests of the public are a relevant consideration in the consideration of whether the processing is fair, and, if we concluded that processing would be fair, also would be relevant in deciding whether condition 6 of Schedule 2 is met. 2273. We agree with the findings of previous Tribunals that there is a distinction to be drawn between personal data relating to an individual’s public and his private life. This is a proper consideration to take into account when making the generalised assessment of fairness that is required under the first data protection principle. But we also agree with the comments made in the Baker case that “where data subjects carry out public functions, hold elective office or spend public funds they must have the expectation that their public actions will be subject to greater scrutiny than would be the case in respect of their private lives. This principle still applies even where a few aspects of their private lives are intertwined with their public lives but where the vast majority of processing of personal data relates to the data subject’s public life.” 74. Taking all the relevant factors into account as set out above, we conclude that the disclosure of the disputed information, save for the disputed information relating to Derek Martin, would not be fair. Therefore, disclosure would breach the first data protection principle and the exemption in section 40(2) of FOIA is engaged in respect of the disputed information relating to the individuals other than Derek Martin. 75. In light of Mr Martin’s evidence to us, we consider that he would not suffer any distress if the disputed information relating to him were to be disclosed, he does not object to disclosure and he no longer has an expectation that the information would be kept confidential. We are therefore satisfied that disclosure of his personal data would be fair. 76. Having reached that conclusion, we must go on to consider whether, in respect of his personal data, at least one of the relevant conditions for processing in Schedule 2 DPA is met. 77. Condition 1 of Schedule 2 DPA provides as follows: 23The data subject has given his consent to the processing. 78. We are satisfied on the evidence we heard from Mr Martin that he has given his consent to the processing (the disclosure) of his personal data and we find that a relevant condition is met. 79. In respect of Derek Martin’s personal data therefore, disclosure would not breach the first data protection principle and the exemption in section 40(2) of FOIA is not engaged. Conclusion and remedy 80. For the reasons given above, the exemption in section 40(2) of FOIA is engaged and the DEL entitled to withhold the disputed information for three of the individuals. 81. The exemption in section 40(2) of FOIA is not engaged and the DEL not entitled to withhold the disputed information relating to Derek Martin. The Department for Employment and Learning must now disclose to Ms Ince the information identified relating to Derek Martin, with the names of other identified persons redacted, to ensure compliance. 82. Our decision is unanimous. 83. An appeal against this decision may be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person seeking permission to appeal must make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of the receipt of this decision. Such an application must identify the error or errors of law in the decision and state the result the party is seeking. Relevant forms and guidance for making an application can be found of the Tribunal’s website at www.informationtribunal.gov.uk. 24Signed Annabel Pilling Judge Date: 17 November 2010 25"

Action Required Disclosure in line with this appeal determination. Dated this 11 day of April 2009 Signed: Robin Callender Smith Deputy Chairman Information Tribunal 3Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. In March 1950 George Kelly was found guilty of a double murder and sentenced to death. He was duly executed and, as required by the legislation of the time, his body interred in the grounds of Walton Prison, Liverpool. 2. Following an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, in June 2003 the Court Appeal quashed Mr. Kelly's conviction following an application by Kathleen Hughes, the daughter of George Kelly. The Appellant represents Mrs Hughes. 3. Following the abolition of the death penalty in 1965 the then Home Secretary stated that he would consider applications from relatives or descendants of executed prisoners for exhumation and reburial outside prison grounds. Mrs Hughes first made such an application in 1996. A decision was ultimately taken by the Minister, Harriet Harman, to issue a licence for the exhumation of the remains of Mr. Kelly. The decision to issue a licence was communicated by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry of Justice) to the Appellant by a letter dated 13 December 2005. 4. The present appeal arises out of a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) that the Appellant made to the Additional Party for information relating to the issuing of the exhumation licence referred to above. 5. In particular the Appellant requested a copy of the advice given to the Minister to issue the exhumation licence in principle for Mr. Kelly; a copy of all communications with the National Offenders Management Service (NOMS) regarding this matter; and the records in relation to communications with a named individual. The request for information 6. The Appellant made the original request to the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) on 15 December 2005. On 18 January 2006 the DCA responded explaining 4Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 that it considered the advice was exempt under the Act but that it required further time to consider the public interest test. In relation to the communications with a named individual the DCA enclosed a copy of the letter sent to the individual on 1 December 2005 and a copy of the communication sent to a NOMS official to advise him of the position on 30 November 2005. 7. Eventually on 6 October 2006 the DCA issued a refusal notice. In relation to the advice given to the Minister the DCA stated that section 36 ""Prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs"" was engaged and that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption. The DCA also stated that, in relation to the communications with the named individual, it was located in another document - a note of a telephone conversation - but that this was considered exempt under sections 40 and 41. 8. On 2 November 2006 the Appellant requested an internal review of the decision to withhold the advice and the telephone note. In his letter the Appellant also queried if the telephone note and the other two letters sent to him were all the information held in relation to the second part of this request. 9. On 1 March 2007 the DCA provided the Appellant with the response to his request for an internal review. The internal review upheld the application of section 36 to the advice given to the Minister and sections 40 and 41 to the telephone note. The internal review did find that the communication with NOMS, in relation to the decision to issue an exhumation licence in principle, had not been addressed and that this would now be looked into. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 10. On 4 March 2007 the Appellant contacted the Information Commissioner to complain about the way his request for information had been handled, and specifically asked the Commissioner to consider the refusal to disclose the requested information and the time taken to issue a refusal notice. 11. The IC’s investigation found that the Additional Party had failed to respond to part of the request (the communications with NOMS) in breach of the requirements of section 1 (1). The IC also found that the refusal notice was in breach of the 5Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 requirements of section 17 (1) of FOIA. The IC found that the advice to the Minister was not exempt under section 36 (2) (b) of FOIA as the public interest favoured disclosure of the information. However he did find that the advice to the Minister was the personal data of a third party and therefore exempt under section 40 (2). He also agreed that the note of the telephone conversation was exempt under section 40 (2). The appeal to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal on 29 May 2008. From that point on the progress of the appeal became fitful as, at various stages, it appeared that the Appellant and the Additional Party might be able to resolve their differences. 13. Setting out the chronology of that process would not further illuminate this Decision. Suffice it to say that, by the time the Tribunal was dealing with this appeal and the eventual compass of the matters in dispute, the issues had become very narrow. The relevant statutory provisions 14. Under section 1(1) FOIA a person who has made a request to a public authority for information is, subject to other provisions of the Act: (a) entitled to be informed in writing whether it holds the information requested (section 1(1) (a)) and (b) if it does, and to have that information communicated to him (section 1(1) (b)). 15. The duty to provide the requested information imposed under section 1(1) (b) will not arise where the information is itself exempted under provisions contained in Part II FOIA (sections 21 to 44). 16. Section 40 FOIA provides in relevant part: “(1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if - The duty to confirm or deny— 6Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is – (a) in a case where the information falls within any of the paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ‘data’ in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene – (i) any of the data protection principles … (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (7) In this section— ... ‘data subject’ has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of [the Data Protection Act 1998]; ‘personal data’ has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act.” 17. Both section 40(1) and section 40(2) FOIA (where satisfied by subsection (3)(a)(i) or (b) of that section) are absolute exemptions. 18. Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides the definition of the term “data”: “In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires— ‘data’ means information which— (a) is being processed by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose, (b) is recorded with the intention that it should be processed by means of such equipment, 7Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 (c) is recorded as part of a relevant filing system or with the intention that it should form part of a relevant filing system, . . . (d) does not fall within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) but forms part of an accessible record as defined by section 68; or (e) is recorded information held by a public authority and does not fall within any of paragraphs (a) to (d);” 19. By section 1(1) DPA, the term “public authority” means a public authority as defined by FOIA. Thus, the Disputed Information constitutes “data” within the meaning of the DPA, in that - even if it does not fall within paragraphs (a)-(d) - it will fall within paragraph (e). 20. Section 1(1) of the DPA also defines the terms “data subject” and “personal data”: “‘data subject’ means an individual who is the subject of personal data; ‘personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual;” 21. In relevant part, the first data protection principle states – “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met …” 22. Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 DPA states - “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the 8Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject”. The questions for the Tribunal 23. The questions to be decided by the Tribunal in this appeal relate to: (i) a submission to the Minister Harriet Harman MP dated 23 November 2005 (the “Submission”); (ii) a telephone attendance note of a conversation with another relative of Mr Kelly (the “Attendance Note”); and (iii) whether those parts of the Disputed Information which continue to be withheld from the Appellant are exempt under section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Evidence 24. The Tribunal has seen all the relevant documentation without redaction (on a ""closed"" basis) and the variously redacted versions of the Submission of 25 November 2005 that have been disclosed to the Appellant by the Additional Party. 25. One of the reasons for the variations in the redaction of that Submission occurred because Mrs Hughes gave her consent to the disclosure to the Appellant of some data personal to her. 26. The telephone attendance note relates to a conversation with another relative of the late Mr George Kelly. The Additional Party continues to withhold the entirety of that note on the basis that it consists entirely of third party personal data. The Respondent agrees with that characterisation and for reasons explored below the Tribunal agrees with that position and rejects the appeal on this point. 27. The Tribunal regards all evidence submitted to it about family members as Closed Submissions. 9Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 Legal submissions and analysis 28. The MOJ maintains that it is clear that all the data contained in the final redacted portion of the Submission constitute personal data being: (1) the name and contact telephone number of the author of the Submission; (2) the names and members of the Civil Service to whom the document was circulated and (3) ""third parties related to the deceased as well as their personal opinions, disputes, some personal history and their ongoing actions in relation to the issue"" (Decision Notice Paragraph 63). 29. None of the parties submit that the redacted data constitutes sensitive personal data. Questions of the disclosure fall to be considered by reference to the First Data Protection Principle and the 6 conditions provided for in Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act. 30. The MOJ submits that the only condition provided in Schedule 2 which could be relevant to this case is Condition 6 (that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued -- in this instance -- by the Appellant). The MOJ submits that condition 6 cannot be satisfied because: (a) the Appellant has been provided with the vast majority of the submission including, in particular, material points in Paragraphs 8 -- 14 which address the arguments for and against the grant of the application for exhumation; (b) in these circumstances the Tribunal must be satisfied as to what legitimate interest member of the public could have in seeing details of the author of the submission, details of those to whom it was circulated, or matters relating to the relatives of George Kelly; (c) if the Appellant’s interest -- as a member of the public -- is found to be legitimate then the Tribunal must then be satisfied that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of the public interest; (d) in this regard, it is submitted, the Tribunal needs to ask itself whether the Appellant's purposes can only be achieved by the disclosure of the redacted data and whether the disclosure is proportionate to the aim pursued. 10Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 31. In relation to the entirety of the Telephone Note the MOJ submits it is exempt under section 40 (2) for the reasons given above in Paragraph 16. 32. The Appellant characterises the remaining undisclosed information as “very limited” and – having regard to BBC television coverage of issues surrounding this exhumation – as information in which there is legitimate public interest in what can happen in the determination of such licence applications. 33. He points out that there was a gap of 32 months after Mr Kelly’s conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal before Mr Kelly received a “lawful and Christian funeral”. 34. In relation to the author of the Submission, the Appellant maintains this is not a very junior official without any ""public facing"" role. The Appellant maintains that the author was, for a very considerable time prior to 2003, the active and public face of the Department in processing exhumation licenses and related matters. The Appellant maintains the author: "" attended events -- such as those relating to retained organs -- and meetings and his contact details were disclosed and were well known.” The Appellant had met him in the aftermath of the retained organs ""scandal"" when he was the responsible and public facing official who dealt with issues like this. He was the ""decision maker"" concerned in all matters to do with exhumation licences unless and until over-ruled at Ministerial level. 35. In terms of the Telephone Note the Appellant does not accept that its entirety is personal data. Conclusion and remedy 36. In terms of the Telephone Note the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding to the required standard -- the balance of probabilities – that this contained personal opinions about family members, personal information generally and falls within the ambit of conversations with or about external third parties by a Government Department which are correctly withheld. 37. Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner and Mr. Baker (EA/2006/0015 and 0016 at Paragraph 28) encapsulates what the Tribunal 11Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 must consider: ""If A makes a request under FOIA for personal data about B, and the disclosure of personal data would breach any of the data protection principles, then the information is exempt from disclosure under the Act: it follows from section 40 (2) read in conjunction with section 40 (3) (a) (i), or (when applicable) section 40 (3) (b) which does not apply in these appeals. This is an absolute exemption -- section 2 (3) (f) (ii) FOIA. Hence the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure under section 2 (2). However... the application of the data protection principles does involve striking a balance between competing interests, similar to (though not identical with) the balancing exercise that must be carried out in applying the public interest test where a qualified exemption is being considered."" 38. Also: ""The concept of lawfulness [in Schedule 1 paragraph 1] cannot sensibly be addressed without considering the conditions set out in Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 also, if it is applicable, because any disclosure which failed to meet at least one of the conditions in the schedules would be contrary to section 4 (4) DPA 1998. This is made clear by the words ""in particular"" in the first principle."" Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] UKHL 47 at paragraph 30 per Lord Hope. 39. The details in the Telephone note are both personal and confidential. The Tribunal has considered whether redaction might leave anything meaningful in this telephone note without infringing of the requirements of the legislation and has concluded this would not be possible. 40. The situation in terms of the Submission dated 28 November 2005 is different. The starting point is that Mr George Kelly had his conviction for a notorious double murder quashed in June 2003. At that point he was an innocent man. It is reasonable for the public -- and this is not limited to his relatives -- to want to understand how the exhumation decision was arrived at in these circumstances and, insofar as it is possible, to understand the reasons for any delay (particularly the 32 months that occurred in this case) in the proper burial accorded to him. 41. The Tribunal has noted the significant difference between the starting position of the MOJ in relation to the Submission and the final redacted document as it stands at 12Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 the time of this appeal hearing. The MOJ would argue that it was not until Mrs Hughes consented to allow her personal data to be revealed that a further and more limited redaction could take place. 42. However the current (final) redaction is, in the Tribunal's view, still much too restrictive. Proper caution and sensitivity about the issues set out on the Submission is one thing but it is clear to the Tribunal that – in the balancing exercise that is at the core of decisions in this area – the balance tips in favour of disclosure with the most minimal redaction possible and proportionate, and that this disclosure generally is necessary in the public interest. 43. In cases such as this HM Prison Service and the Ministry of Justice are dealing with delicate and sensitive historical issues. With the improvements in forensic science techniques it is quite possible in the future that there will be other cases like Mr. Kelly’s where a person has been executed by the State and then exonerated through the appeal system and where relatives wish for a proper burial to take place. The matters set out in the Submission are generally informative about the process and the issues which need to be considered and it is in the public interest that these are disclosed. 44. The Appellant raises the issue of the ""cc"" list of names at the conclusion of the Submission. The Tribunal has seen both the redacted and the un-redacted list and is not persuaded that the public interest requires disclosure of any more of the names than the two that appear on the redacted list. 45. It does however believe that the author of the Submission may be identified. This is an individual who should expect his role to be subject to public scrutiny and who prepared the submission for Ministerial approval. There is inevitably a public profile in a role such as this individual holds and that role requires a significant level of personal judgement and individual responsibility, particularly given the nature of the issues over which advice had to be given. Disclosure of the name is unlikely to cause unwarranted damage or distress to the individual in terms of his safety and security, his career or his reputation.

Signed Date: 27 May 2008 Deputy Chairman 2Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This is an appeal by Mr. McBride (the “Appellant”), against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), dated 23 April 2007. The Decision Notice relates to a number of requests for information made by the Appellant to the Privy Council Office (the “PCO”) (now the Ministry of Justice), under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). 2. Since the date of the request, the responsibilities of the PCO have become subsumed into the new Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”). Accordingly, the MoJ now stands in the place of the PCO, as the Additional Party. For convenience, however, we will refer to the Additional Party as the PCO in this determination, since it has been referred to as such by the parties throughout this appeal. The Request for Information 3. On 3 March 2005, the Appellant wrote to the PCO requesting the following information: “(1) Copy of the contents of my Visitor (University of London) file ref 563(120) – not including the material already sent to me – and any other material relating to me. (2) Details of all interests declared by Baroness Amos under the Ministerial Code of conduct or otherwise. (3) Details of all work undertaken for the PCO by Roy Beldam and all payments made to him by or on behalf of the PCO since 1998. (4) Details of all work undertaken by the PCO for the University of London from 1999-date and all payments made to the PCO in that period by or on behalf of the University of London. (5) Details of circumstances in which bonuses, performance related pay or any other addition to basic salary is paid to senior staff, in particular the clerk and deputy clerk of the PCO. (6) Details of any such payments made 2000-date. (7) Details of all visitor cases involving the University of London 1999-date. (8) Number of visitor cases heard 1999 to date, outcomes of each, number in which a hearing was (a) requested and (b) granted.” 4. The PCO provided some of the information requested. In respect of the rest, it relied on various exemptions under FOIA, or said that no information had been found. 3Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 5. Following an internal review carried out at the Appellant’s request, the PCO substantially upheld its previous decision. However, the PCO provided certain additional information in response to Request 2. The Complaint to the Commissioner 6. On 20 July 2005, the Appellant made a complaint to the Commissioner that the PCO had failed to provide him with the information he had requested. Subsequently, in his letter of 13 December, 2005, the Appellant elaborated on why he disagreed with the PCO’s position. 7. The Commissioner undertook inquiries. During the course of these inquiries, Mr Alex Galloway, the Clerk to the Privy Council, wrote to the Commissioner on 10 April 2006 to say that the PCO had reconsidered its position on Request 1. Although the PCO had initially relied on the exemptions in sections 35 and 40, it said that its position now was that since Baroness Amos’ role as University Visitor was unconnected with her role as a Minister or member of the Privy Council, that information was not held by the PCO for the purposes of FOIA. 8. Following his inquiries, the Commissioner issued a Decision Notice setting out inter alia, the following findings: • The PCO had dealt with the requests relating to the University Visitor, in accordance with section 1(1)(a). The information covered by the Requests 1, 7 and 8, was not held by the PCO for the purposes of FOIA. However, in failing to advise the Appellant that it did not hold the information for the purposes of FOIA, the PCO was in breach of section 1(1)(a). • The PCO had correctly applied the exemption in section 41 (information provided in confidence) in relation to Request 2. • The PCO could not rely on section 40(2) in relation to details of payments made to senior staff in respect of Requests 5 and 6, and was required provide the information requested, but as overall cumulative totals, without reference to the identities of the individual members of staff. The Appeal to the Tribunal 9. By a Notice of Appeal dated 12 September 2007, the Appellant appealed to the Tribunal against the Decision Notice. There has been no cross-appeal by the PCO. 10. In his Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant says that the Commissioner was wrong in law as to the status of and relationship between the Privy Council, the Privy Council Office, and the Visitor; that he wrongly allowed a claim for exemption under section 41; that he wrongly allowed a claim for exemption under section 40 in relation to payments to staff; and that he wrongly failed to take account of the Appellant’s request under the DPA. 11. In a separate document, the Appellant has expanded on his Grounds of Appeal by setting out his comments on the individual paragraphs of the Decision Notice. Most 4Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 of these comments are more in the nature of submissions and we have considered them as such. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction 12. The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in dealing with an appeal from a Decision Notice is set out in section 58(1) of FOIA. If the Tribunal considers that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law or, to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, the Tribunal considers that he ought to have exercised that discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner. Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. 13. Section 58(2) confirms that on an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Decision Notice is based. In other words, the Tribunal may make different findings of fact from those made by the Commissioner, and indeed, the Tribunal will often receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner. The Appeal Hearing 14. There was an oral hearing of this appeal over a two day period. 15. We heard evidence from Mr. Alexander Galloway. He was the Clerk to the PCO from 1998 to 2006 which means that he was in office during the period relevant to this request, and was therefore able to give evidence from his own knowledge. He had submitted both open and closed Witness Statements. His evidence in relation to the latter was heard in a closed session. 16. We will refer to the relevant aspects of Mr. Galloway’s evidence, below, together with our findings. The closed evidence was quite limited and we can deal with it in this determination, without the need for a closed Annex, although certain details may need to be excluded. There were no other witnesses. 17. We have considered all the documents, received from the parties (even if not specifically referred to in this determination), in particular, the documents contained in the agreed bundle of documents, the supplementary bundle of documents submitted by the Appellant just prior to the hearing (for which leave was granted at the hearing), as well as the documentary evidence submitted at and after the hearing in accordance with directions made at the hearing. Questions for the Tribunal 18. The key issues to be determined by the Tribunal in this appeal are in relation to Requests 1 and 2. The issues are as follows: Request 1: Is the information which is in the possession of the PCO in relation to the University Visitor file, held by the PCO for the purposes of FOIA? Request 2: To the extent that they have not already been provided to the Appellant, are the details of all interests declared by Baroness Amos under the Ministerial Code of Conduct or otherwise, exempt from the disclosure requirements of FOIA by reason of section 41? 5Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 19. It was common ground between the parties at the hearing that Requests 3, 4, 7 and 8 are not live, either because the information has been provided to the Appellant, or because the Appellant is not pursuing these points. However, Requests 5 and 6, raise some issues that we will need to deal with, at least briefly. Evidence and Findings Request 1 20. The right of access established by FOIA applies only to information held by the public authority to which the request is made. If the information is not held by it, there is no duty of disclosure. 21. FOIA does not define what is meant by “held”. It does not use terms such as “power, possession or control” that are found in other legal contexts, nor does it adopt the language in The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 which provide that “held” means information that “is in the authority’s possession and has been produced or received by the authority.” What it does do, however, is to exclude from the disclosure requirements of FOIA, information that is held by a public authority on behalf of another person. By virtue of section 3(2), such information is not “held” by the public authority for the purposes of FOIA. Of course, information that a public authority holds on behalf of another person may be subject to disclosure if that other person is a public authority, but that would have to be as a result of a request made to that public authority. 22. Section 3(2) provides as follows: (2) For the purposes of this Act, information is held by a public authority if- (a) it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person, or (b) it is held by another person on behalf of the authority 23. In the present case, the PCO does not dispute that it has the information requested in its possession, but says that it holds this information on behalf of another, namely, the University Visitor. We are not called upon in this appeal to make any findings as to whether the University Visitor is itself a public authority. It has not been argued that it is, and more importantly, the request in issue here was made to the PCO, so it is only the PCO’s obligations under FOIA that are in issue. 24. It may be helpful at this juncture to explain briefly what a University Visitor is. Until 2004, each of the long-established Universities in England and Wales were overseen by a “Visitor” whose role it was to determine disputes arising between the University and its members. So for example, students who were dissatisfied with their teaching or felt they had been unfairly treated by the University, could petition the Visitor of that University. The Visitor had exclusive jurisdiction over such disputes. In law, the Courts had very limited scope to review a Visitor’s decisions (see R v. Lord President of the Privy Council (on appeal from R v. Hull University Visitor) [1993] AC 682). On 1 January 2005, the office of the University Visitor was effectively abolished with the role being assigned to the Office of Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, under the terms of the Higher 6Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 Education Act 2004. These developments have no bearing on this appeal, but we mention them for completeness and to explain why we may use the past tense in some instances. 25. This appeal is concerned only with the Visitor for the University of London. Prior to the changes referred to in paragraph 24, the statutes of the University of London provided that the Visitor was the Sovereign, acting through the Lord President of the Council (ie, the Privy Council). The person holding the position of Lord President of the Council at the relevant time, was Baroness Amos. The evidence is that although the Queen was informed of decisions taken by the Visitor, for practical purposes, the Visitor was the Lord President of the Council. For the purposes of this determination, all references to the Visitor are intended to be references to Baroness Amos in her capacity as Visitor. 26. We return now to the central question of whether information in the Appellant’s Visitor file was held by the PCO for the purposes of FOIA. This is the file containing information in relation inter alia, to the Appellant’s grievances against the University of London which had formed the subject matter of two Petitions by him to the Visitor. 27. Many of the arguments put forward by the parties have focused on the particular status of the Privy Council, the Privy Council Office, and the Visitor. In our view, the issue before us is not one that turns on their status. It is also not an issue that turns on who owns the information, nor on whether the PCO has exclusive rights to it, nor indeed on whether there is any statutory or other legal basis for the PCO to hold the information. Rather, the question of whether a public authority holds information on behalf of another is simply a question of fact, to be determined on the evidence. 28. The evidence in this case shows that the PCO performed all the administrative and management functions in relation to the office of Visitor as detailed in Mr Galloway’s open Witness Statement. Whether it was the proper function of the PCO, and a proper use of taxpayers’ money for the PCO to undertake that work, are issues which the Appellant has raised during the course of this appeal, but they are not issues that fall within this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. We do not mean by this to imply any wrongdoing. What we are concerned about, however, is the reality of what was actually being done, rather than what should or could have been done. 29. Specifically, and of particular relevance to the present case, the PCO dealt with all Petitions to the Visitor. In fact, Petitioners were told to address their Petitions to the PCO. The PCO communicated with the Petitioners as to process and timing. All correspondence was sent out on the PCO’s headed paper and signed by PCO staff. Senior civil servants in the PCO recommended to the Visitor what decisions should be taken on the Petitions. They also drafted the decisions except where they considered it appropriate to instruct external Counsel to do so. These decisions were usually approved by the Visitor, with only minor changes. 30. The staff who undertook this work was the same staff that did other PCO work and their time was not separately accounted for. All staff costs and other expenses were paid for from the PCO’s budget. Indeed, we note that this work was included in the PCO’s Departmental Plan alongside all other work carried out by the PCO, and PCO staff was appraised in relation to this work. There was also no confidentiality 7Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 agreement, service agreement, nor any cost-recharging arrangement between the PCO and the University Visitor. 31. On this evidence, we are entirely satisfied that the PCO held the information in Request 1 on its own behalf. As a matter of practice and perception, it is clear that the PCO’s role in relation to Visitor cases was integral to its functions. We consider it telling in this regard that when it first received the Appellant’s request, the PCO’s response did not suggest that it held the information on any other person’s behalf. This is not a situation where the information was simply on the PCO’s premises because, for example, the Visitor had left it there. The PCO managed and controlled the information, and in fact the PCO itself produced much of the information contained in Visitor files. The PCO could edit or delete the information, and it could decide whom to send it to or whom to withhold it from. Indeed, in response to the Appellant’s requests, it could have provided the information to the Appellant, and in fact, did provide some information. It has not been suggested that it did not have the authority to do so. 32. We recognise that our finding means that an applicant may be entitled to information in relation to this Visitor, but not in the case of others where equivalent information is not held by other public authorities. However, that does not detract from our reasoning. FOIA is not a guarantee that different public authorities will hold the same type of information; it simply provides a regime where applicants can access the information that a given public authority does actually hold. 33. Since we find that the PCO holds the information requested, it follows that it must provide the information to the Appellant, unless it can properly rely on any exemptions in FOIA. As already noted, when the PCO first refused the request, it did so citing sections 35 and 42. Subsequently, during the course of the Commissioner’s enquiries, Mr. Galloway informed the Commissioner that the PCO had proceeded on an erroneous legal basis. From that point onwards, the PCO did not seek to rely on any exemptions, even as an alternative basis for its refusal. 34. This means that if it did not succeed in persuading us that the information was held on behalf of another, disclosure would be required. Although this was self-evident, it was only when we made it clear at the hearing that this would be the result that the PCO said that it expected the Tribunal to deal with the issue of whether the information was held on behalf of another as a preliminary matter. If that ruling went against the PCO, it should then have an opportunity, at a later date, to address any applicable exemptions. We found this to be a surprising position for the PCO to take. There had been no indication sought from or given by the Tribunal that it would proceed in this way, and clearly the hearing had been convened as a full hearing to dispose of all the issues. 35. In the event, the issue was resolved for all practical purposes because the PCO conceded that it could not justify relying on section 35. Plainly, that exemption has no real relevance to this request, and it is unfortunate that the PCO ever sought to invoke it. It is something that seems to have caused the Appellant concern, because quite rightly, he was not able to see how that exemption could be engaged. 8Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 36. To the extent that Request 1 covers information that may fall within the scope of the exemption in section 42, the Tribunal asked to see that information at the hearing and was shown a file comprising a number of documents relating to the Appellant’s applications for Judicial Review. The PCO confirmed at the hearing that this is the only information in respect of which it relies on section 42. The Appellant, in turn, confirmed that he was not seeking disclosure of any information relating to his applications for Judicial Review. That being the case, we do not need to consider section 42 further. 37. There is one final point in connection with Request 1 that we wish to record. The information within the scope of this request includes correspondence between the PCO and Sir Roy Beldam. The PCO has said that it wishes to redact Sir Roy’s personal address, the brief reference in the PCO’s letter of 9th October 2003 to a matter personal to Sir Roy’s family, as well as any references to petitions other than the Appellant’s. The Appellant stated at the hearing that he has no objection to these redactions being made. The information sought to be redacted may, in any event, be exempt under section 40, but given the Appellant’s agreement, we do not need to address this further. Request 2 38. Under Request 2, the Appellant has asked for details of all interests declared by Baroness Amos under the Ministerial Code of Conduct or otherwise. In its letter of 12 April 2005, the PCO provided the information coming within the scope of Request 2 which is recorded in the House of Lords’ Register (in other words the information that is in the public domain), but withheld other information on the basis of section 41. 39. In his evidence, Mr. Galloway explained the process by which the information requested was obtained by the PCO from Baroness Amos. He also explained how the disclosure obligations operate for Members of the House of Lords and for Ministers. 40. In brief, his evidence was that: • Members of the House of Commons and House of Lords are required, under their respective Codes of Conduct, to register “relevant interests”. These interests are declared publicly, through the Register of Members’ Interests and Register of Lords’ Interests, respectively. • The House of Lords’ Code of Conduct provides that Members must register all relevant interests in the Register of Lords’ Interests. The test of “relevant interests” under paragraph 9 of the Code is whether the interests might reasonably be thought, by the public, to affect the way in which a Member discharges his or her parliamentary duties. The test is not whether a Member’s actions in Parliament will be influenced by the interest, but whether the public might reasonably think that this might be the case. Relevant interests include both financial and non-financial interests. The Code contains a non-exhaustive list of financial and non-financial interests which must always be registered, as well as those interests which may be relevant depending on their significance. 9Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 • Because Ministers exercise executive responsibilities, they are required to disclose a wider range of interests than other MPs and Peers. • When Baroness Amos was appointed as Lord President of the Council in October 2003, Mr. Galloway sent her a letter, in line with established practice, inviting her to discuss her interests with him with a view to identifying any potential areas of difficulty. The letter expressly stated that the information she provided to him would be kept confidential. In reply, she provided him with details of her interests. Mr Galloway says these were very straightforward and it was clear to him that there was no conflict between her interest and her official duties. He says that most of her interests were then listed on the Register of Peers’ interests. The few that were considered not to be “relevant interests” were not listed and are described in Mr Galloway’s closed Witness Statement. • He has been informed that all correspondence between him and Baroness Amos was shredded in August 2007, on the machinery of government changes. However, he has clear memory of his exchange with her in 2003 as described above. Baroness Amos’ letter to him setting out her interests has survived and is appended to his closed Witness Statement. 41. At the hearing, Mr. Galloway confirmed that the letter he wrote to Baroness Amos inviting disclosure, was a standard form of letter. Although that particular letter has been destroyed, he produced a letter which he identified as a template of the letter he had sent to her. We note that this template letter sets out the types of interests the addressee ought to disclose, and gives an assurance that the information provided will be “handled in strictest confidence”. In addition, it confirms that any advice given by the writer will remain confidential. 42. We turn now to consider whether the information which the PCO has withheld in relation to Request 2, is exempt under section 41 of FOIA. 43. The relevant part of section 41 provides as follows: 41 (1) Information is exempt information if- (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person. 44. Both the Commissioner and the PCO have put forward a number of arguments as to why section 41 is engaged. Some of these arguments are about why it is in the public interest that this information should not be disclosed. That is not, however, strictly relevant, because section 41 is an absolute exemption. In order for the information to be exempt, section 41(1)(b) requires that disclosure should constitute an actionable breach of confidence. Public interest may be a relevant consideration in assessing whether there is likely to be a defence to such an action, but the public interest relevant there is the public interest in disclosure, rather than the public interest in withholding the information. 10Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 45. It is clear that the requirements of section 41(1)(a) are met because the information was obtained by the PCO from another person, here, Baroness Amos. The next question is whether the requirements of section 41(1)(b) are also met, i.e., whether disclosure of the information in question by the PCO would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by Baroness Amos (there being no suggestion that it would be actionable by anyone else). This would not entail Baroness Amos bringing proceedings against herself as Lord President of the Council, as the Appellant has suggested. The information was disclosed by her personally, and any action for breach of confidence would be brought by her in her personal rather than in her public capacity. 46. Since the appeal was heard, the Tribunal has had the benefit of the High Court’s decision in Secretary of State for the Home Department v. British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and the Information Commissioner [2008] EWHC 892 (QB). Although its focus was the interplay between sections 41 and 44 in the context of The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the High Court makes a number of helpful observations on the law of confidence which we have borne in mind, including its comments as regards the relevance of Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). 47. We are satisfied that an obligation of confidence does arise in the present case and that any disclosure would be actionable, both because of the nature of the information in issue, and because of the circumstances in which it was imparted to the PCO. The information in issue relates to Baroness Amos’ financial interests. We have had sight of the information. It comprises brief entries under the headings “Financial Interest” and “Property”. The information is clearly private in nature. Baroness Amos provided Mr. Galloway with full details of her interests, beyond what she might have been expected to list on the public register, on his express assurances of confidentiality. The information was imparted in circumstances which clearly gave rise to an expectation of confidentiality, if not an express agreement, that it would be kept confidential. 48. If and to the extent that for a breach of confidence in respect of private information to be actionable, it is also necessary to show detriment arising from its disclosure, we consider that the very nature of the information which relates to Baroness Amos’ private financial interests, would compromise her private life, which is also protected by Article 8 of the ECHR. 49. We have taken into account that in claims for breach of confidence, the law recognises, in some cases, a defence of public interest. However, in our view, the private interests of Baroness Amos in the withheld information outweigh any public interest in disclosure, and also outweigh the qualified right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR. The Code of Conduct sets out a framework for disclosure of interests that might give rise to a potential conflict or a perception of such conflict. Those interests that were considered to be “relevant interests” were publicly declared by Baroness Amos. The ones that were not declared and which the Appellant is seeking disclosure of, were considered not to be relevant to her public role. There is no suggestion that the test of “relevant interests” was not correctly applied, and no reason to find, on the facts of this case, that the test of public interest as reflected in the Code of Conduct falls short of what a Court would apply in an action for breach of confidence. 11Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 50. For all these reasons, we find that the information within the scope of Request 2 is exempt under section 41. Requests 5 and 6 51. In Request 5, the Appellant asked for “details of circumstances in which bonuses, performance related pay or any other addition to basic salary is paid to senior staff, in particular the clerk and deputy clerk of the PCO”. In Request 6, he asked for “details of any such payments made 2000-date”. 52. In relation to Request 5, the PCO said that the information was already in the public domain and they referred the Appellant to where it could be found. As regards Request 6, they said that details of payments made to senior staff were exempt under section 40 (personal data). 53. In his complaint to the Commissioner, the Appellant does not appear to have taken further issue with the PCO’s response on these requests, except as we have set out in paragraphs 54 to 57 below. However, in his Decision Notice, the Commissioner did deal with the PCO’s reliance on section 40 in respect of payments made to senior staff. He agreed with the PCO that those details constitute “personal data”. However, he considered that the PCO should have asked itself whether disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles. He then went on to find that there was a legitimate public interest in the details of the payments being made available to the public and he required the information to be provided to the Appellant, as overall cumulative totals, without reference to the names of any individuals. This information was sent to the Appellant on 15 June 2007. 54. We have some misgivings about the Commissioner’s analysis. He did not identify which data protection principle he considered would be breached. Also, pursuant to section 2(3)(f)(ii), where disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles, section 40(2)(b), read in conjunction with section 40(3)(a)(i), gives rise to an absolute exemption (albeit that the application of the data protection principles may involve striking a balance between competing interests). However, since the information has been provided to the Appellant, the issue is academic for the purposes of this appeal. ` 55. A separate issue arises in relation to Request 5 that we do need to address. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Appellant requested copies of the performance appraisals of Mr Galloway and of Mr Graham Donald, the former Deputy Clerk. The PCO says that this information was not part of the Appellant’s requests of 3rd March 2005, and it has therefore dealt with it as a new request. 56. The PCO refused the request on 7 February 2008. It considered that the information was exempt under section 40(2) of FOIA because it constituted personal data. At the hearing, Mr Galloway explained that he was not formally appraised, although Mr Donald was. He also explained that Mr Donald’s appraisal was conducted by reference to a particular appraisal form, and that the PCO had provided a copy of a blank form to the Appellant. 57. All the parties acknowledged, at the hearing, that even if section 40(2) was engaged, parts of the appraisal form might fall outside its scope. However, as the 12Appeal Number EA/2007/0105 parties also acknowledged, the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to deal with this request if the information falls within the scope of the requests that are the subject of this appeal, in particular, Requests 5 and 6. 58. Having considered the completed appraisal form, we are satisfied that the information does not come within the scope of Requests 5 and 6; the appraisal form makes no reference to pay or bonuses. Therefore, it is not within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, as part of this appeal, to order disclosure, whether in redacted form or otherwise. Decision 59. We allow the appeal in respect of Request 1. 60. We dismiss the appeal in respect of Request 2. 61. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction as part of this appeal to make any order with respect to the performance appraisal requested by the Appellant. 62. The Panel’s decision is unanimous.
