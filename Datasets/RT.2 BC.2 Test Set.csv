Ash v McKennitt [2006] EWCA Civ 1714 Decision: The Appeal is refused.Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This appeal is against the Information Commissioner’s Decision FS5346570 dated 21st August 2012 which concluded that East Sussex County Council (the Council) were entitled to rely upon s41 FOIA to withhold the disputed information. 2. The Appellants have an on-going complaint against the Council and the Home Care company who were contracted to provide services on behalf of the Council in relation to the care received by their sister prior to her death in 2009. The Appellants believe that she was neglected and this neglect contributed to her death. They visited her flat following her death and were concerned about its state.1 They rely upon her physical state when admitted to hospital shortly before her death and note that her heating did not appear to be working, large quantities of unused medication were found in the flat and they question whether there was food for her to eat at home. In particular they assert that there were no home care visits between 24th and 28th December 2008. Their suspicion is that the Council did not have sufficient information relating to their sister to enable them to make appropriate decisions relating to her care. 3. They wrote to the Council in April 2009 on 9th May 2011 stating: “We are writing to ask you to consider our request to have information from our sister’s case notes given to us under FOI”. 4. The Council refused the request on 15th June 2011 relying upon s41 FOIA namely that the information had been provided in confidence. This decision was upheld on 15th November 2011 following an internal review. 5. In their complaint to the Commissioner the Appellants argued that the information they were seeking was not about their sister rather about decisions made about her. 1 They have provided the Tribunal with photographs to underline their concerns. 2Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 Scope of the Appeal 6. The Appellants have indicated that they would like the Care Agency to be reprimanded and possibly fined for their lack of care of their sister. This is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction which is limited to determining whether the Freedom of Information Act has been correctly applied in this case2. Withheld information within the scope of the request 7. At a meeting with the Council in February 2009, the Appellants handed a request for information to the Council. Although they asked for information under the Data Protection Act, this was treated as a FOIA request and refused on 31 March 2009, the Council relying upon s41 FOIA (confidential information). The decision was upheld upon review in April 2009. The Appellants persisted with their complaints into their sister’s care and following intervention from the Local Government Ombudsman, the Council agreed to carry out an independent investigation reviewing the involvement of the Council and the Care Agency concerned. The Appellants were provided with a very heavily redacted copy of the report in May 2010.3 They requested an unredacted copy verbally and the Council upheld its decision to make redactions in a letter dated 23rd July 2010. When the Appellants complained to the Commissioner about the redaction of the report the complaint was not admitted since the request had not been made in writing4. The Appellants were advised to submit a written request for the information that they were seeking. 8. Although the Appellants then submitted a written request for information in May 2011, the Tribunal is satisfied that the investigative report is not within scope for this appeal. The Tribunal notes that the terms of the written request in 2009 did not include the investigative report carried out by the independent investigator because it had not yet been commissioned or completed. The written request in 2011 which is the subject of this appeal is limited by its own terms to: “information from our sister’s case notes” 2 S58 FOIA 3 Redactions under s41 (confidential information) and s40 (personal data) 4 S8 FOIA 3Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 9. The request states that this is a second request, we are satisfied that the 2009 request for essentially the same material is being referenced here, in particular because it is in the context of: “As this is a second request, if you refuse, we would like you to consider waiving the internal review procedure that we have already gone through with Investigating Officer John Fowden...” We note that John Fowden was the author of the investigative report and that the internal review of the verbal request for the report was carried out by Philip Baker. We are therefore satisfied that the request on its face is not for the report conducted by John Fowden. 10. From the correspondence between the Council and the Commissioner it is clear that the Council treated this request as not including the report which they treated as a separate matter. Whilst the report was compiled using information gleaned from the case notes, it also contained conclusions and recommendations which never formed part of the Appellants’ sister’s case notes as it was completed after she had died. We note the Commissioner’s observations that the report was provided electronically whereas the social care file had to be retrieved from the archive and provided in hard copy in support of our conclusion that the report did not form part of the case file. Despite the opportunity to make further submissions and to vary directions if more time is needed5, the Appellants have not challenged the Commissioners submissions on this point before the Tribunal. 11. In light of our finding that the report is not included within the request, if the Appellants wish the Commissioner to consider the report they would need to apply to the Council in writing asking for an unredacted or less redacted copy of the report, and then if refused they would have the right to apply to the Commissioner. Confidential information 12. S41provides (1) Information is exempt information if – 5 Additional Case management Note 7.1.13 4Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 a) It was obtained by the public authority from any other person... and The disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person...”. From the Tribunal’s reading of s41 and the associated case law on confidence6, the Tribunal is satisfied that it should consider the following matters in reaching its determination. Has the information been obtained by the public authority from any other person? 13. The Appellants dispute that they are seeking information about their sister, since they are already aware of her background. Their argument is that they want information about the “[the Council’s] decisions about our sister’s care, how they formed their opinions about her competence to make decisions regarding her care of herself and their instructions to the Care Agency... as to the tasks they required them to undertake”.7 The Tribunal is satisfied that the opinions formed about the Appellants’ sister and the Council’s instructions to the Care Agency are based upon information obtained from their sister and that this element is therefore satisfied. It is not possible to separate the decisions and actions from the disclosures which led to them being made. The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence 14. The Commissioner argues that the obligation of confidence is created by the very nature of the carer/client relationship. This is sensitive personal data8, it pertains to the physical and mental health of the Appellants’ sister. She was given the opportunity to indicate that she agreed to let the Council “share personal information on care with family members/friends listed below”. She did not sign her agreement or list anybody in the space provided9. Having reviewed the withheld information we are also satisfied that on several occasions she was given specific assures that the information 6 See paragraph 16 below 7 Letter to Tribunal 15.10.12 8 S2 DPA 1998 9 A standard “Consent to Gather and Share Information “ form signed 13th May 2008 during a review visit by a Community Assessor (Care Manager) 5Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 she provided would be treated confidentially. We are therefore satisfied that this ground is made out. Does the information have the necessary quality of confidence? 15. We have reviewed the withheld material, we are satisfied that it contains sensitive personal data (as defined by s 2 DPA) and is neither trivial nor is it readily available by any other means. Consequently it retains the necessary quality of confidence. There must be an unauthorised use of the information such that an action for breach of confidence could be brought. 16. Bluck v IC and Epsom and St Helier University NHS EA/2006/0090 was a first tier Tribunal decision relating to an application for disclosure of medical records of a deceased patient. In Bluck the Tribunal reviewed the existing case law10 and determined that the cause of action for breach of confidence does survive the death of the person whose private information is concerned and that the personal representative of that person is able to enforce the right. The law of confidence must be read in the context of articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and we are satisfied that the effect of this is that if the fact of disclosure of private information would be contrary to an individual's reasonable expectation of confidentiality this would be sufficient to bring a claim for breach of confidence in the absence of any other detriment. 17. Although we are not bound by this decision we agree with that panel’s analysis of the law and apply it in this case for the same reasons. 18. For s41 to be engaged the Tribunal must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that disclosure under FOIA would be unauthorised. In his Decision Notice the Commissioner stated that “there are no issues surrounding consent... in this case”11 The Tribunal notes that in their letter to the Appellants dated 15th November 2011 the Council stated that: 10 Relying upon Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Limited [1968] FSR 415 ChD Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers [1990] 1AC109. Ash v McKennitt [2006] EWCA Civ 1714 11 DN paragraph 24 6Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 “Even where the person making a request for information may in fact be the same person that would be entitled to bring any action for breach of confidence as the personal representative of the deceased, it is likely that disclosure under the Act would still amount to a breach of confidence. This is because information disclosed under the Act is thereafter in the public domain, and is not disclosed solely to the individual(s) who have requested it.12” 19. The Tribunal agrees with this statement but notes that the evidence before the Council as to whether the Appellants were the personal representatives and whether they did in fact consent to disclosure to the world at large under FOIA was incomplete. 20. In the preceding paragraph of the same letter the Council had stated that: “In determining whether disclosure would give rise to a legal action for breach of confidence, it is not necessary to establish that, as a matter of fact, the deceased person has a personal representative who would take action.” We would not expect the Council to consider this in every case, but in establishing that disclosure would be unauthorised under FOIA in this case we note: a) It was known to the Council and the Commissioner that the Appellants are the sisters of the deceased. b) There is evidence of SERCO writing to Mrs Skinner in relation to her late sister’s pension. c) References within the closed bundle to individuals named as next of kin at times by the deceased, consequently there is substantial prima facie evidence that the Appellants may be the deceased’s personal representative. 21. The evidence is not determinative because it is not clear whether there was a valid will and if so the identity of any executors or if intestate who was responsible for administering the Estate. This is a question of evidence and one not dealt with by the Council or the Commissioner. The Commissioner relies upon this factual uncertainty in support of his contention that it was correct to uphold the reliance upon s41. We 12 The same point is relied upon by the Commissioner in his additional submissions 18.1.13 7Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 note that in the other cases referred to by the Commissioner13 in argument before the Tribunal it had been established as a matter of fact that the applicant was either not the personal representative or not the only personal representative and that disclosure under FOIA was opposed by the non applicant personal representative in each of these cases. 22. In light of the facts already apparent in this case the Tribunal considers it was incumbent upon the Council and thereafter the Commissioner to check whether as a matter of fact the Appellants were the personal representatives and if so whether they did consent to disclosure under FOIA. In reaching this conclusion we also note the obligation upon the Council to provide advice and assistance pursuant to s16 FOIA. 23. For this reason the tribunal adjourned the case, and issued adjournment directions dated 7th February 2013 to seek further evidence from the Appellants. The Appellants responded by way of letter dated 18th February 2013 and the Commissioner made additional submissions dated 13th March 2013. From this evidence we are satisfied on a balance of probabilities that: <U+F0B7> There is a will, <U+F0B7> There is therefore an executor of the will and that is not either of the Appellants, <U+F0B7> The Executor has locus to act as the deceased’s personal representative, <U+F0B7> There is no evidence that there is consent for disclosure under FOIA from the Executor. 24. Consequently we are satisfied that notwithstanding the consent of the Appellants for this information to be disclosed to the public at large under FOIA, this ground is made out. 13 Bluck, FS5040052 and FS50328160 8Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 Is there a public interest defence such as to render a breach of confidence un-actionable? 25. S41 FOIA is an absolute exemption14 however, it is still necessary to consider the public interest in determining whether any breach of confidence is actionable. This differs from the public interest test as set out in s2(2)(b) FOIA where if the balance of public interest is equal the information must be disclosed. For a defence to breach of action to succeed the public interest must be positively in favour of disclosure. 26. The Commissioner acknowledges the public interest in transparency and accountability however, he argues that that public interest is met by the provision of the redacted investigation report. 27. The Commissioner maintains that the public interest is clearly in favour of maintaining the confidentiality of the information relying upon: a) the public interest in service users having confidence that their care staff will not disclose their sensitive data when they divulge details of their medical history and lifestyle, b) the concern that if they do not have such confidence they may be deterred from seeking assistance or not be candid in their communications. c) Failure by service users to be frank or to become involved with social services could prejudice the effective functioning of social services 28. The Appellants believe that errors and omissions were made by the carers and that the public interest would be served in these mistakes being aired. They wish to lay blame where necessary in order to teach what they perceive to be much needed lessons. 29. The Tribunal accepts that transparency is an important public interest: a) where errors have been made it is important that the public can be satisfied that improvements are being made to prevent this happening again. b) if errors have not been made it is also important that the public know this and can have confidence in their services, c) disclosure would also aid transparency in terms of how well public money is allocated. 14 Pursuant to s2(3)(G) FOIA 9Appeal No. EA/2012/0195 30. We do note the investigation carried out by Mr Fowden which found that there were no serious lapses in the care provided to the Appellants’ sister . Additionally where elements of the complaint were upheld recommendations have been made to address these. We consider that this goes some way towards meeting the Council’s obligations of transparency and accountability and that this reduces the public interest in this information being disclosed in its entirety. 31. Having weighed the competing public interests as set out above, we are satisfied that the public interest lies in favour of withholding the information. Conclusion 32. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that s41 is engaged and that the information was correctly withheld under FOIA, the appeal is therefore refused.

The Tribunal refers to this as the ‘public interest balancing test’. Request by Mr Henney 6 On 9 November 2012 Mr Henney requested the following information from the appellant: I have been told that there was some form of ‘independent review’ of the roll-out [of smart meters] which endorsed the Department’s opinion of the viability of the roll-out. I would be obliged if you would provide me with the key papers. 7 On 6 February 2013 DECC confirmed that there had been an independent review in the form of a project assessment review (PAR) carried out by the Major Projects Authority (MPA) DECC provided a copy of the review subject to substantial redactions. DECC stated that the redacted information was withheld under section 35(1)(a) and 36(2)(b)(ii) FOIA and that names and contact details of individuals were redacted 5Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 under s 40(2) FOIA. 8 The complainant wrote to DECC on 26 February 2013 and challenged its basis for withholding information. DECC subsequently carried out an internal review the outcome of which was provided on 25th of April 2013. This agreed that further information in the report should be disclosed. However for the rest of the information contained in the report DECC maintained its reliance on the original exemptions cited and also introduced section 43(2) FOIA as another ground for withholding elements of the report 9 The complainant complained to the Commissioner on 26 April 2013. The complainant however clarified that he did not seek the disclosure of personal data under s.40(2) FOIA. That complaint resulted in the Decision Notice (DN) FS50495646. That DN contained a number of conclusions. First the Commissioner concluded that the applicable access regime was FOIA and not the EIR. The Commissioner also concluded that although s35(1)(a) was engaged the public interest balancing test favoured disclosure of the information withheld by the DFE under that provision. Furthermore the Commissioner concluded that sections 35 and 36 of FOIA are mutually exclusive. Finally the Commissioner concluded that s43(2) FOIA was not engaged. The Appeal to the Tribunal 6Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 10 On 25 April 2014 DECC submitted an appeal to the Tribunal (IRT) challenging the conclusions in relation to ss35(1)(a) and 43(2) but not any other conclusion. 11 Mr Henney subsequently (it was not altogether clear to the Tribunal when but no party disputed that the issue was properly before the Tribunal) appealed the Commissioner’s conclusion that the applicable access regime was FOIA and not the EIR. 12 At the start of the hearing the Tribunal was also invited by the Commissioner to consider whether too much information had been redacted in accordance with Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (FTT) (GRC) Rules 2009 from documents presented by DECC and contained within the ‘open’ bundle which was available to Mr. Henney. The Tribunal were concerned by this application since the matter appeared to have been considered by the Registrar to the IRT in some detail and adjudicated upon. The Commissioner claimed to have been excluded from this process. The Tribunal doubted whether they were obliged to reconsider the Registrar’s decision. The Tribunal did however allow the Commissioner and DECC to reach an agreement over further disclosures which was then endorsed by the Tribunal. The Questions for the Tribunal 13 The Tribunal judged that the principal questions for them to consider were: first, whether the applicable access regime was FOIA or the EIR; 7Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 secondly whether ss 35 and 43 of FOIA were ‘engaged’ and then thirdly, to consider whether in relation to each of the claimed exemptions whether the public interest balancing exercise favoured maintaining the exemption or disclosure. Evidence & Submissions 14 This matter was considered by the Tribunal by way of an oral hearing on 4 and 5 November 2014 with four live witness – Mr David Blackall – from the Major Projects Authority (MPA), Dr Daron Walker from DECC, Mr Alex Henney and Mr Nick Hunn (for Mr Henney). The Tribunal also received and heard oral and written submissions from the parties. The Tribunal received evidence and submissions in both open and closed sessions. 15 The issue as to whether the applicable access regime was FOIA or the EIR was dealt with by way of submissions at the start of the hearing. Both the Commissioner and DECC submitted that the applicable regime was FOIA. Both parties accepted that in principle information which was directly about the rollout of the smart meters scheme had the potential for being information on a policy likely to affect the environment and thus within the EIR regime – given that the smart meter programme (SMP) was designed in part to reduce energy usage. In both parties submissions this would be information within 2(1)(c) of EIR - measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a). However both parties 8Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 submitted that the disputed information was specifically about the communication and data components of the smart meters project and thus was effectively ‘one remove’ from information on a policy likely to affect the environment. The choice of communications and data model was very unlikely by itself to have an impact on energy usage or the environment. The Tribunal were referred to the case of Uttlesford District Council v IC which, the Tribunal was told, provides authority for the principle that information that which is a ‘step further away from the primary focus’ and which does not in itself affect the state of the natural environment is governed by the FOIA access regime and not that of the EIR. 16 Mr Henney was understandably hampered in his ability to make submissions on this point since he was not aware what the withheld information contained – at least not in any detail. Mr Henney did however submit that the chosen model for data and communications for the smart meter system may result in delays in the full roll-out of the system and that in turn would have an environmental impact since the claimed environmental benefits of smart metering would be delayed. Mr Henney made it clear that a major concern for him over the choice of the applicable access regime was the inability of the government to veto a disclosure decision under EIR – a power which only existed under FOIA. 17 On retiring to consider its decisions the Tribunal felt that the issue of the applicable access regime had not been very thoroughly considered by either DECC or the Commissioner. Both parties seemed to be operating 9Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 on the basis that it was a ‘given’ that the appropriate access regime was indisputably FOIA. The Tribunal did not consider that the issue was so clear cut and the parties were consequently written to in the following terms: 18 Following preliminary deliberations by the Tribunal, the Tribunal Judge has directed that all parties should provide additional written submissions within 14 days of the receipt of this direction to address the following points: In relation to the preliminary point as to whether the Environmental Information Regulations or the Freedom of Information Act applied to the withheld information the Tribunal has noted that none of the parties in the case addressed the Tribunal on the relevance of Regulation 2(1)(e) of the EIR – cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used within the framework of the measures and activities referred to in (c) Paragraph (c ) reading – measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements. The Tribunal also on its own initiative considered the Aarhus Convention, which is the precursor to the 2003/4/EC directive, 10Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 Article 2, 2b says: (b) Factors, such as substances, energy, noise and radiation, and activities or measures, including administrative measures, environmental agreements, policies, legislation, plans and programmes, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment within the scope of subparagraph (a) above, and cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used in environmental decision-making; The Tribunal noted that there appeared to be no dispute between the parties that the smart meter programme is a ‘policy’ within 2(1)(c) of the EIR. The Tribunal considers that there is quite a compelling argument that the PAR is an analysis ‘used within the framework’ of this policy and the fact that it is focused only on data and communications for the smart meter programme is not particularly pertinent. Alternatively looking at the Convention there is a compelling argument that the PAR has been ‘used in environmental decision- making’. The Tribunal acknowledges that there may be a counter-argument that paragraph (e) should be read restrictively to include only analyses that bear directly on the items in paragraph (c) of EIR 2(1) although the phrase ‘within the framework of’ would appear to be a fairly open term rather than a restrictive one. Similarly the term ‘used in’ in the Convention appears to be a fairly open rather than restrictive phrase. 11Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 The Tribunal could not find any direct authority on the point. The Tribunal was not particularly assisted by the Uttlesford case. In that case the information sought (the Council’s code of conduct) was very remote from any environmental concern and the decision that it was not with the EIR hardly surprising – although the Tribunal noted that in that case the Commissioner advocated that the code of conduct was covered by the EIR. The Tribunal felt that the parties did not deal with the issue of the applicability of FOIA/EIR very well (although Mr. Henney’s difficulties were entirely understandable). The Tribunal therefore seeks further written submissions on this point bearing in mind the issues outlines above. 19 All parties duly responded with further submissions. In their submissions both DECC and the Commissioner contended that the PAR could not be properly categorised as an economic analysis used within the framework of environmental measures and activities. The Commissioner did however concede that the matter was finely balanced, The Commissioner also helpfully referred the Tribunal to relevant First Tier Tribunal decisions whilst conceding that these were not binding. Mr Henney was again hampered by the fact that he did know the contents of the PAR although he asserted that as a matter of common sense the PAR must contain some form of economic analysis. DECC additionally submitted that the Tribunal should be considering only whether the data and communications component of the SMP as opposed to the whole SMP 12Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 was a measure within Reg 2(1)(a) or (b) EIR but the Tribunal were unanimous in rejecting this as the correct approach. 20 The Tribunal noted in particular the decision in the Southwark v ICO and Lend Lease case (EA/2013/0162). Here the Tribunal ruled that a viability assessment in connection with a housing development fell to be considered under the EIRs. Of particular note are the following paragraphs: 29. We are inclined to agree with Mr. Pitt-Payne QC that there may be a tendency to overuse EIR; almost an assumption that, for example, anything to do with land or anything to do with the planning process in England and Wales is outside the scope of FOIA. 30. The answer to this tendency, it seems to us, is not the development of the vague notion of “remoteness”. Rather it lies in a purposive application to the facts of a case of the definition of “environmental information” in Reg 2(1) EIR. It may be for example that the phrase “the state of the elements of the environment” is not always given sufficient weight. 33. In our judgment the project is so large that it is likely to affect the state of the landscape as an element of the environment. The activity or programme, call it what you will, is therefore a measure 13Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 which falls within subparagraph (c). 34. In our judgment it also cannot be doubted that the viability assessment including Appendix 22 is an economic analysis used within the framework of that measure and activity. By virtue of subparagraph (e) therefore, the information requested falls within EIR and not within FOIA. 21 The Tribunal noted the approach of the FTT in the Land Lease case - firstly it looked at the programme as a whole and whether that fell within the definition (para.33), even though that was not in itself the focus of the request. Secondly it decided that the viability assessment (which was the focus of the request) is a form of economic analysis used within the framework of that measure and activity and thus falls within part (e) of the definition. 22 The present Tribunal adopted a similar analysis in the DECC case. The Tribunal looked first at the smart meter project as a whole, and noted that it was agreed amongst the parties that this would have environmental benefits through things such as reduced carbon emissions. Therefore it can rightly be said to be a measure which is likely to affect the elements and factors of the environment. Following the Southwark approach, the PAR, being itself a form of viability report against policy objectives, is used within the framework of that measure. Consequently it has the potential to be covered by 2(1)(e) of the EIR. 14Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 23 DECC (and to a certain extent the Commissioner) contend that the PAR here is not within 2(1)(e) because PARs in general are not designed to be a form of economic analyses. However, in the Tribunal’s view, whether or not a PAR in general is not a form of economic analysis is irrelevant. In this case the PAR discusses two options, both of which have differing financial consequences. The government is already committed to expenditure on one option (the DCC model - £200m according to Mr. Walker’s open evidence); however through this PAR the government is examining whether an alternative approach (the Decentralised Model, “DM”) will have preferential benefits. The DM would not cost the same as the DCC given that there would be no need to procure either a data or communications provider. So even if there is no explicit mention of costs or benefits within the PAR, the exercise is itself an economic assessment given that the two possible outcomes have differing financial implications. 24 In response to DECC’s particular submissions – the Tribunal considered that the PAR was unquestionably used “within the framework” of the SMP. DECC contended that PARs in general are not designed to be used as part of such projects, (para.14(d) of their recent submissions). But the Tribunal considered that this PAR had a direct bearing on a fundamental element of the SMP and its overall cost. Therefore it must be right to say that the PAR has been used within the SMP policy “framework”. 15Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 25 The Tribunal also considered an additional approach or analysis: The Tribunal noted that DECC contends at para.9 of their latest submissions that even if the PAR can be regarded as a measure under EIR 2(1)(c), it does not or is unlikely to affect the state of the elements of the environment. The Tribunal noted that the PAR deals with the communications and data models, an essential and integral part of which is a 2G network. Such a network will produce emissions. Emissions from mobile telecommunications constitute environmental information, as per the findings in Office of Communications v IC & T-Mobile (EA/2006/0078): 27. ...The definition is not intended to set out a scientific test and its words should be given their plain and natural meaning. On that basis we believe that radio wave emissions that pass through the atmosphere from a base station to any solid component of the natural world are likely to affect one or more of the elements listed in subparagraph (a) or the interaction between some of them. Accordingly we conclude that the radiation from a base station falls within the meaning of the expression “environmental information”. 26 Consequently the Tribunal unanimously concluded that the applicable access regime is the EIR and not FOIA. 27 The parties are now requested to submit their proposals for the future conduct of this matter to the Registrar by 30 January 2015. The Tribunal considers that there are two possible options – that the current ruling on 16Appeal No.: EA/2014/0103 the applicability of the EIR is subject to appeal to the Upper Tribunal or that the ruling is accepted and the matter relisted for hearing based on the applicable exemptions within the EIR.

Action Required Disclosure in line with this appeal determination. Dated this 11 day of April 2009 Signed: Robin Callender Smith Deputy Chairman Information Tribunal 3Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. In March 1950 George Kelly was found guilty of a double murder and sentenced to death. He was duly executed and, as required by the legislation of the time, his body interred in the grounds of Walton Prison, Liverpool. 2. Following an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, in June 2003 the Court Appeal quashed Mr. Kelly's conviction following an application by Kathleen Hughes, the daughter of George Kelly. The Appellant represents Mrs Hughes. 3. Following the abolition of the death penalty in 1965 the then Home Secretary stated that he would consider applications from relatives or descendants of executed prisoners for exhumation and reburial outside prison grounds. Mrs Hughes first made such an application in 1996. A decision was ultimately taken by the Minister, Harriet Harman, to issue a licence for the exhumation of the remains of Mr. Kelly. The decision to issue a licence was communicated by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry of Justice) to the Appellant by a letter dated 13 December 2005. 4. The present appeal arises out of a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) that the Appellant made to the Additional Party for information relating to the issuing of the exhumation licence referred to above. 5. In particular the Appellant requested a copy of the advice given to the Minister to issue the exhumation licence in principle for Mr. Kelly; a copy of all communications with the National Offenders Management Service (NOMS) regarding this matter; and the records in relation to communications with a named individual. The request for information 6. The Appellant made the original request to the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) on 15 December 2005. On 18 January 2006 the DCA responded explaining 4Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 that it considered the advice was exempt under the Act but that it required further time to consider the public interest test. In relation to the communications with a named individual the DCA enclosed a copy of the letter sent to the individual on 1 December 2005 and a copy of the communication sent to a NOMS official to advise him of the position on 30 November 2005. 7. Eventually on 6 October 2006 the DCA issued a refusal notice. In relation to the advice given to the Minister the DCA stated that section 36 ""Prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs"" was engaged and that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption. The DCA also stated that, in relation to the communications with the named individual, it was located in another document - a note of a telephone conversation - but that this was considered exempt under sections 40 and 41. 8. On 2 November 2006 the Appellant requested an internal review of the decision to withhold the advice and the telephone note. In his letter the Appellant also queried if the telephone note and the other two letters sent to him were all the information held in relation to the second part of this request. 9. On 1 March 2007 the DCA provided the Appellant with the response to his request for an internal review. The internal review upheld the application of section 36 to the advice given to the Minister and sections 40 and 41 to the telephone note. The internal review did find that the communication with NOMS, in relation to the decision to issue an exhumation licence in principle, had not been addressed and that this would now be looked into. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 10. On 4 March 2007 the Appellant contacted the Information Commissioner to complain about the way his request for information had been handled, and specifically asked the Commissioner to consider the refusal to disclose the requested information and the time taken to issue a refusal notice. 11. The IC’s investigation found that the Additional Party had failed to respond to part of the request (the communications with NOMS) in breach of the requirements of section 1 (1). The IC also found that the refusal notice was in breach of the 5Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 requirements of section 17 (1) of FOIA. The IC found that the advice to the Minister was not exempt under section 36 (2) (b) of FOIA as the public interest favoured disclosure of the information. However he did find that the advice to the Minister was the personal data of a third party and therefore exempt under section 40 (2). He also agreed that the note of the telephone conversation was exempt under section 40 (2). The appeal to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal on 29 May 2008. From that point on the progress of the appeal became fitful as, at various stages, it appeared that the Appellant and the Additional Party might be able to resolve their differences. 13. Setting out the chronology of that process would not further illuminate this Decision. Suffice it to say that, by the time the Tribunal was dealing with this appeal and the eventual compass of the matters in dispute, the issues had become very narrow. The relevant statutory provisions 14. Under section 1(1) FOIA a person who has made a request to a public authority for information is, subject to other provisions of the Act: (a) entitled to be informed in writing whether it holds the information requested (section 1(1) (a)) and (b) if it does, and to have that information communicated to him (section 1(1) (b)). 15. The duty to provide the requested information imposed under section 1(1) (b) will not arise where the information is itself exempted under provisions contained in Part II FOIA (sections 21 to 44). 16. Section 40 FOIA provides in relevant part: “(1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if - The duty to confirm or deny— 6Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is – (a) in a case where the information falls within any of the paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ‘data’ in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene – (i) any of the data protection principles … (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (7) In this section— ... ‘data subject’ has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of [the Data Protection Act 1998]; ‘personal data’ has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act.” 17. Both section 40(1) and section 40(2) FOIA (where satisfied by subsection (3)(a)(i) or (b) of that section) are absolute exemptions. 18. Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides the definition of the term “data”: “In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires— ‘data’ means information which— (a) is being processed by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose, (b) is recorded with the intention that it should be processed by means of such equipment, 7Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 (c) is recorded as part of a relevant filing system or with the intention that it should form part of a relevant filing system, . . . (d) does not fall within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) but forms part of an accessible record as defined by section 68; or (e) is recorded information held by a public authority and does not fall within any of paragraphs (a) to (d);” 19. By section 1(1) DPA, the term “public authority” means a public authority as defined by FOIA. Thus, the Disputed Information constitutes “data” within the meaning of the DPA, in that - even if it does not fall within paragraphs (a)-(d) - it will fall within paragraph (e). 20. Section 1(1) of the DPA also defines the terms “data subject” and “personal data”: “‘data subject’ means an individual who is the subject of personal data; ‘personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual;” 21. In relevant part, the first data protection principle states – “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met …” 22. Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 DPA states - “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the 8Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject”. The questions for the Tribunal 23. The questions to be decided by the Tribunal in this appeal relate to: (i) a submission to the Minister Harriet Harman MP dated 23 November 2005 (the “Submission”); (ii) a telephone attendance note of a conversation with another relative of Mr Kelly (the “Attendance Note”); and (iii) whether those parts of the Disputed Information which continue to be withheld from the Appellant are exempt under section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Evidence 24. The Tribunal has seen all the relevant documentation without redaction (on a ""closed"" basis) and the variously redacted versions of the Submission of 25 November 2005 that have been disclosed to the Appellant by the Additional Party. 25. One of the reasons for the variations in the redaction of that Submission occurred because Mrs Hughes gave her consent to the disclosure to the Appellant of some data personal to her. 26. The telephone attendance note relates to a conversation with another relative of the late Mr George Kelly. The Additional Party continues to withhold the entirety of that note on the basis that it consists entirely of third party personal data. The Respondent agrees with that characterisation and for reasons explored below the Tribunal agrees with that position and rejects the appeal on this point. 27. The Tribunal regards all evidence submitted to it about family members as Closed Submissions. 9Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 Legal submissions and analysis 28. The MOJ maintains that it is clear that all the data contained in the final redacted portion of the Submission constitute personal data being: (1) the name and contact telephone number of the author of the Submission; (2) the names and members of the Civil Service to whom the document was circulated and (3) ""third parties related to the deceased as well as their personal opinions, disputes, some personal history and their ongoing actions in relation to the issue"" (Decision Notice Paragraph 63). 29. None of the parties submit that the redacted data constitutes sensitive personal data. Questions of the disclosure fall to be considered by reference to the First Data Protection Principle and the 6 conditions provided for in Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act. 30. The MOJ submits that the only condition provided in Schedule 2 which could be relevant to this case is Condition 6 (that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued -- in this instance -- by the Appellant). The MOJ submits that condition 6 cannot be satisfied because: (a) the Appellant has been provided with the vast majority of the submission including, in particular, material points in Paragraphs 8 -- 14 which address the arguments for and against the grant of the application for exhumation; (b) in these circumstances the Tribunal must be satisfied as to what legitimate interest member of the public could have in seeing details of the author of the submission, details of those to whom it was circulated, or matters relating to the relatives of George Kelly; (c) if the Appellant’s interest -- as a member of the public -- is found to be legitimate then the Tribunal must then be satisfied that disclosure is necessary for the purposes of the public interest; (d) in this regard, it is submitted, the Tribunal needs to ask itself whether the Appellant's purposes can only be achieved by the disclosure of the redacted data and whether the disclosure is proportionate to the aim pursued. 10Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 31. In relation to the entirety of the Telephone Note the MOJ submits it is exempt under section 40 (2) for the reasons given above in Paragraph 16. 32. The Appellant characterises the remaining undisclosed information as “very limited” and – having regard to BBC television coverage of issues surrounding this exhumation – as information in which there is legitimate public interest in what can happen in the determination of such licence applications. 33. He points out that there was a gap of 32 months after Mr Kelly’s conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal before Mr Kelly received a “lawful and Christian funeral”. 34. In relation to the author of the Submission, the Appellant maintains this is not a very junior official without any ""public facing"" role. The Appellant maintains that the author was, for a very considerable time prior to 2003, the active and public face of the Department in processing exhumation licenses and related matters. The Appellant maintains the author: "" attended events -- such as those relating to retained organs -- and meetings and his contact details were disclosed and were well known.” The Appellant had met him in the aftermath of the retained organs ""scandal"" when he was the responsible and public facing official who dealt with issues like this. He was the ""decision maker"" concerned in all matters to do with exhumation licences unless and until over-ruled at Ministerial level. 35. In terms of the Telephone Note the Appellant does not accept that its entirety is personal data. Conclusion and remedy 36. In terms of the Telephone Note the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding to the required standard -- the balance of probabilities – that this contained personal opinions about family members, personal information generally and falls within the ambit of conversations with or about external third parties by a Government Department which are correctly withheld. 37. Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner and Mr. Baker (EA/2006/0015 and 0016 at Paragraph 28) encapsulates what the Tribunal 11Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 must consider: ""If A makes a request under FOIA for personal data about B, and the disclosure of personal data would breach any of the data protection principles, then the information is exempt from disclosure under the Act: it follows from section 40 (2) read in conjunction with section 40 (3) (a) (i), or (when applicable) section 40 (3) (b) which does not apply in these appeals. This is an absolute exemption -- section 2 (3) (f) (ii) FOIA. Hence the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure under section 2 (2). However... the application of the data protection principles does involve striking a balance between competing interests, similar to (though not identical with) the balancing exercise that must be carried out in applying the public interest test where a qualified exemption is being considered."" 38. Also: ""The concept of lawfulness [in Schedule 1 paragraph 1] cannot sensibly be addressed without considering the conditions set out in Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 also, if it is applicable, because any disclosure which failed to meet at least one of the conditions in the schedules would be contrary to section 4 (4) DPA 1998. This is made clear by the words ""in particular"" in the first principle."" Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] UKHL 47 at paragraph 30 per Lord Hope. 39. The details in the Telephone note are both personal and confidential. The Tribunal has considered whether redaction might leave anything meaningful in this telephone note without infringing of the requirements of the legislation and has concluded this would not be possible. 40. The situation in terms of the Submission dated 28 November 2005 is different. The starting point is that Mr George Kelly had his conviction for a notorious double murder quashed in June 2003. At that point he was an innocent man. It is reasonable for the public -- and this is not limited to his relatives -- to want to understand how the exhumation decision was arrived at in these circumstances and, insofar as it is possible, to understand the reasons for any delay (particularly the 32 months that occurred in this case) in the proper burial accorded to him. 41. The Tribunal has noted the significant difference between the starting position of the MOJ in relation to the Submission and the final redacted document as it stands at 12Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 the time of this appeal hearing. The MOJ would argue that it was not until Mrs Hughes consented to allow her personal data to be revealed that a further and more limited redaction could take place. 42. However the current (final) redaction is, in the Tribunal's view, still much too restrictive. Proper caution and sensitivity about the issues set out on the Submission is one thing but it is clear to the Tribunal that – in the balancing exercise that is at the core of decisions in this area – the balance tips in favour of disclosure with the most minimal redaction possible and proportionate, and that this disclosure generally is necessary in the public interest. 43. In cases such as this HM Prison Service and the Ministry of Justice are dealing with delicate and sensitive historical issues. With the improvements in forensic science techniques it is quite possible in the future that there will be other cases like Mr. Kelly’s where a person has been executed by the State and then exonerated through the appeal system and where relatives wish for a proper burial to take place. The matters set out in the Submission are generally informative about the process and the issues which need to be considered and it is in the public interest that these are disclosed. 44. The Appellant raises the issue of the ""cc"" list of names at the conclusion of the Submission. The Tribunal has seen both the redacted and the un-redacted list and is not persuaded that the public interest requires disclosure of any more of the names than the two that appear on the redacted list. 45. It does however believe that the author of the Submission may be identified. This is an individual who should expect his role to be subject to public scrutiny and who prepared the submission for Ministerial approval. There is inevitably a public profile in a role such as this individual holds and that role requires a significant level of personal judgement and individual responsibility, particularly given the nature of the issues over which advice had to be given. Disclosure of the name is unlikely to cause unwarranted damage or distress to the individual in terms of his safety and security, his career or his reputation. It is significant that the matters contained in the Submission are carefully thought through and examined comprehensively and objectively. 13Appeal Number: EA/2008/0048 46. Our decision is unanimous.

"348","FOI","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) EA/2010/0146 BETWEEN: ALAN ARKISON Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING Second Respondent DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) Hearing by: Claire Taylor, Tribunal Judge Richard Enderby, Tribunal Member Paul Taylor, Tribunal Member On: 15 March 2011 At: Field House, London Date of Decision: 29 September 2011 Subject Matter Freedom of Information Act 2000: S1 - Whether Information Held Decision of the Tribunal The Appeal is dismissed.REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. The Trading Standards Institute (“TSI”) is a professional body with members from both the public and private sector. 2. In the past, TSI has organised an awards ceremony as part of its National Consumer Week. In 2007, one of these awards, for Consumer Journalist of the Year, went to a journalist who had written an article about the Appellant, the contents of which he had refuted and complained about. 3. The Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”) supported the awards, providing funds and the use of its offices for the judging and ceremony. 4. Consumer Direct is a consumer advice service funded by the OFT. The Information Request 5. On 23 March 2008, the Appellant requested from the OFT a copy of the portfolio considered by the judging panel in the Consumer Journalist of the Year Award for 2007. He also asked for any notes made by the senior officer (Ms Cryne) of the OFT, in deciding this particular award. On 10 April 2008, he asked for the statement supporting the nomination of the winning journalist. These requests are the subject of this appeal. 6. On 31 March, Ms Chilvers who was head of marketing for the OFT gave an initial response that: a. “The competition was run by the Trading Standards Institute, although Christine Wade, Christine Cryne and I were part of the judging panel. Therefore disclosure of this information is not our decision.” 7. On 3 April 2008, Ms Cryne emailed Mr Arkison stating: a. “I can confirm that none of us involved with the judging… kept any paperwork relating to it. All material was taken away by the TSI. However, I do not know whether it was kept after the meeting.” 8. The Appellant made further related requests in a number of letters and emails, and the OFT provided replies. On 6 May 2008, the OFT’s Internal Review Coordinator gave a more formal reply dealing with the various requests. She apologised for her delayed reply explaining that she had been on holiday. She stated that the OFT did not hold the requested information that is the subject matter of this appeal. 9. The OFT’s decision was upheld by an internal review on 12 September 2008. The Decision Notice 10. On 27 July 2010, the Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50202111, in which he concluded that the OFT did not hold the requested information, and that no steps were required to be taken. 11. In forming this decision he considered that: a. The OFT had stated that the requested portfolio and nomination statement which had been considered by the judging panel for the Awards were collected and held by the TSI in November 2007 and ceased to be held by the OFT judges. For this reason it had not been necessary for them to search for the information that had been requested by the Appellant. -2- EA/2010/0146b. He was not persuaded by the Appellant’s view that the OFT did hold the requested information merely because it had given some material assistance and lent its name to the Awards. c. On the balance of probabilities, there was nothing that proved the information was held. The Appeal to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant appealed to this Tribunal by Notice dated 10 August 2010. The Tribunal joined the OFT as a party. 13. The Tribunal has had the benefit of written and oral testimony from the Second Respondent’s witness; submissions from the parties; and the bundles of documents and authorities submitted by the parties. We have considered all of this material, even if not specifically referred to below. 14. Because of the location of the Appellant and his representative, the hearing was conducted in London with a video link to the IAC Glasgow, on 15 March 2011. With the permission of the Tribunal, the Commissioner did not attend the hearing and instead lodged written submissions. The Parties' Submissions and Evidence Appellant Grounds of Appeal 15. The Appellant’s grounds for disputing the Commissioner’s decision is that the Commissioner erred in concluding, on the balance of probabilities, that the OFT did not hold the requested information because: a) the information was (physically) held by the OFT at the time of the request; and/or b) the information was held by the TSI on behalf of the OFT at the time of the request. Evidence 16. The Appellant gave a witness statement early in proceedings. However, once it was accepted that the panel’s remit was limited to that set out in the FOIA, the Appellant graciously withdrew the statement. 17. The evidence included: a. An email of 28 March 2008 at 12:32, from the TSI to, amongst others, Ms Cryne and Ms Wade, that requested they not respond directly to letters from the Appellant: ” ” -3- EA/2010/0146b. Ms Cryne’s reply to the email (copied in 17(a) above) of 28 March 2008 at 13:00 showing an intention to consult with the TSI regarding a reply to the Appellant: ” ” c. Copy of an email of 28 April 2008 from the TSI to Ms Cryne copied to Ms Chilvers with other TSI recipients blanked out: “ ” d. A press release from Consumer Direct of 12 November 2007. This refers to the TSI being in partnership with Consumer Direct, a division of the OFT: “ … … “ -4- EA/2010/0146e. National Consumer Week meeting notes of 8 October 2007 showing Ms Chivers as an attendee. f. Lord Chancellor’s Code of Practice on the management of records issued under section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, (“section 46 code”) which, for instance, includes: i. “Records management is important for many … reasons. Records and information are the lifeblood of any organisation… It supports an authority’s business and discharge of its functions It supports compliance with … legislation … It provides institutional memory.” g. Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs' Code of Practice on the discharge of public authorities' functions under Part I of FOIA Issued under section 45 of the Act, November 2004 (“section 45 code”) which, for instance, includes: i. “There are many circumstances in which requests for information may relate to persons other than the applicant and the authority; …It is highly recommended that public authorities take appropriate steps to ensure that such third parties, and those who supply public authorities with information, are aware of the public authority's duty to comply with the Freedom of Information Act, and that therefore information will have to be disclosed upon request unless an exemption applies. ii. Public authorities should bear clearly in mind their obligations under the Freedom of Information Act when preparing to enter into contracts which may contain terms relating to the disclosure of information by them. iii. When entering into contracts with non-public authority contractors, public authorities may be asked to accept confidentiality clauses, for example to the effect that information relating to the terms of the contract, its value and performance will not be disclosed. Public authorities should carefully consider the compatibility of such terms with their obligations under the Act….Similar considerations will apply to the offering or acceptance of confidentiality obligations by public authorities in non-contractual circumstances. There will be circumstances in which such obligations will be an appropriate part of the acquisition of information from third parties and will be protected by the terms of the exemption provisions of the Act. But again, it will be important that both the public authority and the third party are aware of the limits placed by the Act on the enforceability of expectations of confidentiality, and for authorities to ensure that such expectations are created only where to do so is consistent with their obligations under the Act.…” (Emphasis added.) Submissions 18. The Appellant submitted extremely lengthy skeleton arguments, including the passages below. (We have inserted the headings to organise the arguments). a. Partnership’s motive for denying information held: i. “The TSI and OFT were in partnership to run National Consumer Week which included the Competition. Rogues and crooked traders were to be sought out and exposed for what they were, without benefit of the Courts. Instead the press with help from these two bodies would deal with them; so the partnership could not afford a scandal involving the main prize winner. This was their motive for denying the Appellant the information.” ii. “In the case before you OFT and TSI did have a common aim and purpose – the protection of their Competition.” -5- EA/2010/0146iii. “TSI took the lead in dealing with his request. As a general point he asks the Tribunal to accept that this Competition was about publicity. The partnership wished to show how well they had interacted with the Press in “protecting” the public. It was advertising for business by both OFT and TSI. That is very laudable, provided they themselves are beyond reproach and provided any accusations of wrongdoing are sustainable and the information available under FOIA.” iv. “I submit there was a cover up by OFT when things went wrong and they refused to even consider conducting an enquiry into what had happened because such an enquiry would expose what they as a corporate body had done from the outset of the partnership. v. Their partners, TSI had by this time circumvented their own published code of professional conduct with the help of Consumer Direct, who were at the time supposed to be replying to the Appellant’s FOIA application and were not. This was more embarrassment.” b. Information was held but the OFT moved it: i. “The day after Mrs Cryne received the FOIA application from the Appellant, Chris Armstrong, Honorary Secretary of the TSI (CA) emailed her, not separately as the head of an independent organisation but included with his members... He asked all of the recipients not to respond to the Appellant and to pass any letters to him. There was a clear FOIA request to OFT but within 28 minutes Mrs Cryne had replied to him agreeing to his direction. I submit CA believed OFT still had documents in its possession.” (See para.s 17(a) and (b) above). ii. “When Mrs Cryne had replied … she told CA she had just been going to tell the Appellant they could not help as the Award wasn’t ours”. She sent an Email to the Appellant dated 3rd April 2008 … saying none of the judges kept any paperwork because TSI took it all away. With time to think the story seemed to be changing in emphasis as it was tailored to suit Section 3(2)(a) of the Act.” iii. “On 12th November 2007 OFT published a report on the Internet entitled “Newsroom” [see para. 17(d) above] about the Awards Ceremony. It contains quotes from the Judges on the merits and achievements of all the winners. If the portfolios and notes were removed on the 7th November, never to be seen again, as claimed, how could they have achieved this? On a balance of probabilities this claim was untrue but I shall refer to it again later.” (At the hearing the Appellant also stated it was clear that the prose for the TSI press release was the same so it was the same author.) iv. “At his second attempt IC contented himself with asking routine questions about routine procedures and searches by OFT. I hope to show this was futile since there was no chance the documents were still there…” v. “The internal review dated 12th September… said the portfolios were given to the judges on the day and “it was understood”, removed as soon as the judging was complete. However by 15th June 2010 in a letter from OFT to IC… the position changed considerably to “The portfolio and nomination statement was held in hard copy when it was held by OFT until it was returned to the TSI”. (The Tribunal notes the OFT letter to the commissioner during the investigation stated that the requested information was “held by the OFT until it was returned to the TSI. The OFT does not know if electronic versions of these documents are held by the TSI.” Mr Fisher’s oral testimony, which we accept, clarified that the statement was intended to explain that the judges received -6- EA/2010/0146the portfolios in hard copy, not electronically, and held them at the point of evaluating the nominations.) vi. “That letter also said the documents were not copied to electronic files. Hard copies are usually kept in filing cabinets, cupboards or drawers under a given file number. In this case there was no central reference or record and if Mrs Cryne or Ms Chilvers did have such material their actions were detrimental to any FOIA application. Their credibility is at issue.” vii. “On 28th April 2008 CA sent an email to Mrs Cryne [paragraph 17(c) above] and included his TSI colleagues in it. Attached was a copy of a letter he had sent to the Appellant dated 22nd April 2008... The only other item in the email was a curiously worded piece of advice to his TSI colleagues advising them they were not subject to FOIA. Why would he need to copy Mrs Cryne into this? It was an internal TSI matter. I submit the reasonable person would think he was making a final check to ensure the cupboard was bare and reminding OFT of the joint line to take under FOIA. They were all too willing to comply.” viii. “I have shown the Tribunal the extent of the attempts to prevent the Appellant obtaining the documents he originally sought. OFT were to admit in June 2010 that they had held documents relating to the Competition but claimed, on the word of Mrs Cryne and Ms Chilvers that they had been returned to TSI … I ask the Tribunal to find, on a balance of Probabilities, that they still held them at the time of this application on 23rd March 2008 and it was during the ensuing hiatus that they were passed to TSI – not on conclusion of the judging. I submit TSI were still worried there might still be documents in OFT’s possession, hence their carefully worded email on 28th April 2008.” c. Requested Information should be held for audit purposes: i. “Neither OFT nor the Commissioner has mentioned the Lord Chancellor’s Code of Practice on the Management of Records made under Section 46 FOIA. At Item iv the importance of keeping records is highlighted. At paragraph 8.1 (d) it states “the need to explain and if necessary justify past actions, in the event of an audit etc. ...or if an applicant complains to the ICO about the handling of an FOI request”. At paragraph 8(4) under the heading of ensuring records are kept it states the necessity to “keep accurate records of their daily work”. ii. “OFT had spent nearly £23000 of public money and claimed it had no central or control file to show what they had done and why… OFT had no means of checking the actions or claims of Mrs Cryne or MS Chilvers so were in no position to defend them save for their unsupported word.” iii. “I ask the Tribunal to accept that there was a business need for OFT to keep proper and detailed paperwork to justify their expenditure and to demonstrate their use of the event, with the Awards as the highlight, to promulgate their aims and targets (both their joint ones with TSI and their discrete ones for Consumer Direct alone) and to satisfy the Guidelines [section 46 code].” TSI held papers on OFT’s behalf: s.3(2)(b) FOIA: “held by another person on behalf of the authority”: d. TSI-OFT Partnership: i. “There was no contract or memorandum of understanding to set out the parameters of the partnership agreement with TSI”. ii. “OFT publicly billed itself as being in partnership with TSI, in its publication “Newsroom” … for the media awards as part of National Consumer Week, not -7- EA/2010/0146as a verbal and “informal arrangement” as they would later claim in their review of the FOIA request.” iii. “It is usual in government departments to have a written contract or a memorandum of understanding with other departments or outside bodies …. This ensures both sides know what to expect and what the parameters of the agreement are. In this case as it was claimed to be a verbal “informal arrangement…Because it did not suit the partners, or the third party allied to the partnership, to permit the appellant to have the information he sought, OFT are now claiming that how they billed it was not what they meant…” iv. “In a letter to ICO dated 15th June 2010 … OFT claimed the whole of National Consumer Week belonged solely to TSI … and they got the use of OFT’s logo (It does not say what OFT obtained from the deal). This might have been the case for British Gas but is a spurious argument in the case of OFT. Companies sponsor events and good causes for tax and advertising purposes. If you are selling gas and boiler maintenance, sponsorship of TSI is excellent for business. According to OFT the taxpayer got exactly nothing for their investment.” v. “I invite the Tribunal to accept that I have demonstrated that OFT put far more into the organisation and running of this Competition than they would have us believe…” vi. “Consumer Direct 1. Funded the event spending nearly £23,000 2. Assisted in advertising the Competitions to receive nominations from Consumer Direct Staff. Ms Chilvers was widely quoted in the nomination process … 3. Bought the trophies for the winners and had them engraved. 4. Organised the Judging room at OFT headquarters on 7th November 2007 with lunch for seven people (three OFT judges, three TSI judges and an unidentified other). 5. Organised a room at OFT headquarters for the Award Ceremony with a meal… 6. Published the OFT press release on 12th November 2007 giving a public account of the partnership event (Pages 154-157) for their discrete target audience… 7. Mrs Cryne made a speech for Consumer Direct and a Government Minister from BERR, Gareth Thomas MP, made a speech about the cooperation and joint efforts between OFT and TSI in regulating consumer issues, each in its way.” vii. “If this Competition belonged solely to TSI the reasonable person would have expected that they alone would make a press release advertising the results. Not so, OFT did the same so obviously they had a business need to promulgate the Event also, despite their denials. I ask the Tribunal to find that this action alone proves that OFT had a share in the benefits from the Event for their own business purposes and this alone brings them within the embrace of Section 3(2)(b) no matter where the papers are currently kept.” viii. “However that does not end the matter. I asserted at the beginning that this was a cover up and I would like to refer to an authority the Commissioner introduced. This is the case of Stuart v IC EA/2008/0040 which at Paragraph 41 quotes from the case of Bromley v IC EA/2008/0033 as follows; the Tribunal was required -8- EA/2010/01461. “to consider a number of factors, including the quality of the public authority’s initial analysis of the request, the scope of the search that it decided to make on the basis of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency with which the search was then conducted. Other matters may affect our assessment at each stage, including, for example, the discovery of materials elsewhere, whose existence or content point to the existence of further information with the public authority, which had not been brought to light. Our task is to decide, on the basis of our review of all of these factors, whether the public authority is likely to be holding relevant information beyond that which has already been disclosed.” ix. “May I refer the Tribunal back to the involvement of TSI in this FOIA application at the outset when OFT were in breach of Section 1 of the Act and TSI were involved in deciding what could or could not be given to the Appellant? I suspect there may have been a written contract, from what follows, and TSI were anxious not only that the nomination documents would be denied the Appellant but this contract also.” x. “…The Competition was the main event and an integral part of that Week. The published report on the Awards carried the logo and proclaimed the partnership…” xi. “…the General Counsel … seems to paraphrase the Guidelines in stating that the TSI alone created the portfolio or nomination statement so these remain the property of the TSI. I ask the Tribunal to reject this claim as OFT funded the whole package.” 19. At the hearing the Appellant’s arguments included: Cover Up: a. There has to be a reasonable suspicion of cover up because OFT did not reply properly to his request for five weeks, whilst in correspondence with the TSI. The witness and other senior officers were included in the reply email of 28 March. (See para. 17(b) above). It seems the OFT had been caught on the hop and therefore had to scheme to do something about it. They simply acquiesced to the TSI’s email and handed over to them the paperwork that was the subject of the FOI request. This is because they set out to accuse rogue traders and involve the press, but this is a wild beast which is hard to control. When the OFT received the Appellant’s request they saw there could be major embarrassment for them. It was clear the trader who the winning journalist wrote about disagreed about the truth of the article and this directly affected the competition, bringing the OFT into embarrassment and disrepute as to whether the article was accurate. b. The Appellant claimed that the competition had never been run since. It is a very serious thing to write about traders in newspapers in an accusatory way. The OFT’s association with the competition implies they are putting their name to such things. It is therefore important to keep records. The judges’ credibility would be at issue if they hadn’t kept a central record of the portfolio to justify themselves when someone later asks questions. c. The OFT did not do the procedural things they should have, for instance as the ICO found in the decision notice and in taking into account the section 45 code and the Cabinet Office guidance. Accordingly, this raises the question as to whether they are telling the truth. In relation to Cabinet Office guidance – there should have been a written Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) if the OFT were sponsoring a body. The Appellant would have expected the contract or MOU to ensure TSI would be accountable to provide information for FOIA purposes. In relation to the section 45 code, the OFT were not allowed to agree with the TSI for the latter not to provide it with information if required under FOIA. -9- EA/2010/0146d. The requested information should have been kept by the OFT because anyone who looked at the press release (see para. 17(d) above) would have been entitled to apply under FOIA to see documents. Respondent Submissions 20. The Commissioner’s written submissions included: Information held directly: a. The evidence does not support the Appellant’s conclusion that “it is logical that the judges would retain the copies of portfolios they were given, if for no other reason, than that taxpayers’ money funded this competition and, in the event of an audit, papers would need to be produced.” There is no particular justification for the OFT retaining the requested information. b. The emails provided as evidence in this appeal do not provide any evidence that TSI believed that the OFT held the requested information or that in any way TSI and OFT colluded to remove the information from the OFT to circumvent the Act. The Commissioner would suggest that that Appellant is looking for a conspiracy that is simply not supported by the evidence. Information held by TSI on behalf of OFT c. The Appellant argues that s.3(2)FOIA could be applicable because both the TSI and OFT organised the competition and, as “the papers had to be retained somewhere”. The evidence does not suggest that TSI and the OFT ‘jointly owned’ the competition. Mr Fisher’s evidence is that the NCW and Media Awards are organised by the TSI, with only limited sponsorship and support provided by the OFT such as allowing the use of the OFT’s offices for the Media Awards and judging process. Second Respondent Evidence 21. The TSI press release of 12 September 2007 was referred to: a. “…Local authority Trading Standards Services and Consumer Direct staff are now urged to nominate reporters and media organisations that have helped raise the profile of consumer issues for the 2007 awards…Karen Chilvers, head of marketing for Consumer Direct, said: ""We would not be able to get the Consumer Direct message out so widely without such an excellent network of consumer journalists across the country…It seems absolutely right to reward them for their efforts…"" (We note that it was not clear from the bundle presented to us whose evidence this was. In any event, the evidence has not been disputed.) 22. David Fisher, Director of Consumer Direct of the OFT, gave testimony as follows: a. He was the director of the OFT’s Trading Standards Partnership Team. b. Consumer Direct is a telephone and online consumer advice service offering information and advice on consumer issues. It is funded by the OFT, and delivered in partnership with Local Authority Trading Standards Services. The service is outsourced to suppliers, and individual staff may be employees of local authorities or the private sector. - 10 - EA/2010/0146c. The TSI is an independent professional membership association, which represents trading standards professionals in local authorities, the business and consumer sectors, as well as in central government. d. Having often interacted with the TSI, he has been involved in TSI events and the sifting process of nominees for a TSI consumer award. However, while the OFT sometimes works in partnership with the TSI (just as the OFT works in partnership with many other organisations from time to time), the OFT does not control the TSI and cannot give the TSI instructions. e. National Consumer Week 1 was an annual event comprising a series of initiatives to promote awareness about consumer rights and sources of advice. One of these initiatives was the Media Awards. This was an awards ceremony to recognise the journalists who have done most to actively highlight the efforts of Trading Standards officers or Consumer Direct in their work against rogue traders. The ceremony involved a variety of awards, including the award for ‘National Consumer Journalist of the Year’. TSI has organised this since 1988. From 2004, the OFT and Consumer Direct contributed sponsorship and other support (such as the use of OFT premises for events), and the Consumer Direct logo is used in connection with NCW activities. From the OFT’s perspective, it was a means to raise public awareness of consumer rights and protection issues, and this was a common objective with TSI which explained why they had worked together and why the OFT would have considered it useful to sponsor the competition. Information held by OFT f. The 2007 Media Awards were held on 16 November 2007 at the OFT’s offices. This was a TSI organised event. The OFT provided some support by funding the purchase of trophies etc., and allowing its premises to be used for holding the awards and for the judging process. Three members of OFT staff were invited to participate in the Media Awards judging panel: Ms Wade, Ms Cryne and Ms Chilvers, two of whom at the time held posts within Consumer Direct. Due to the passage of time, none of the three remain employed by the OFT. g. However, the OFT made enquiries following the Appellant’s FOIA request and it was confirmed that on 7 November 2007, the panel members had met at the OFT’s offices and were provided with portfolios by the TSI on each of the nominated journalists, which contained extracts of articles written by them and supporting 500 word nomination statements. The panel members were left to review the papers, deliberate on their choices for a couple of hours, before reaching their decisions. This was the sum total of what they did. The nomination portfolios were then retained by the TSI. Although not personally involved in this particular judging panel, Mr Fisher stated that he had been involved in a similar panel for TSI organised awards and it was his experience that the procedure described for the 2007 awards followed normal practice. h. He elaborated that: i. “Following Mr Arkison’s request for an Internal Review, I understand members of the OFT’s General Counsel’s Office conducted further enquiries with the staff members concerned. I have discussed this with the lawyer in the OFT’s General Counsel’s Office who dealt with the internal review, who told me that he had spoken to Christine Cryne and Karen Chilvers who confirmed that the TSI had retained the Disputed Information at the conclusion of the judging process and that it was not held by the OFT. It was also confirmed during these further enquiries that at no point was the Disputed Information ever copied, stored or recorded in any form by the OFT”; 1 We note that whilst the witness was not clear on the point, the OFT’s representative stated at the hearing that National Consumer Week no longer takes place. - 11 - EA/2010/0146ii. “It is not entirely clear to me on what basis Mr Arkison seeks to challenge the truthfulness of the OFT’s statements, effectively contending that the OFT and its relevant employees are telling lies.” iii. On cross-examination, he stated that there would have been no reason why the judges from the OFT and Consumer Direct would have kept the portfolio after the event. The documents belonged to TSI and he was confident that the judges would not have considered it necessary to question why TSI removed the documents after deliberations, and he could not say whether future requests under FOIA would have been considered as a reason for the judges wanting to keep the information. i. He also relied on the initial response to the Appellant on 31 March 2008, the email to the Appellant of 3 April 2008, and the letter of 6 May 2008 as support for this. Information held by TSI on behalf of OFT j. As to whether the information was held on behalf of the OFT, Mr Fisher stated: i. “…the Media Awards were – and continue to be – organised and administered by the TSI with sponsorship from Consumer Direct. The awards were – and are – given by the TSI and not by Consumer Direct or the OFT. Neither Consumer Direct nor the OFT were involved in determining the rules for the Media Awards’ nominations, nor in collating the portfolios with articles and nomination statements provided to the judges for them to assess and select the competition winner. The OFT did not create or control the Disputed Information; we do not hold it; and we have no right of access to it. Accordingly, I do not see how the TSI can be said to be holding the Disputed Information on the OFT’s behalf.” 23. On cross-examination, Mr Fisher confirmed that: a. There was nothing in writing in relation to the funding and other terms of the relationship between the OFT or Consumer Direct and TSI. b. Consumer Direct staff across various centres may have made nominations for the awards. c. He could not answer the Appellant’s question as to why TSI as an independent privately registered company had what appeared to be a website connected with government. d. He did not know whether TSI held the requested information. Submissions 24. Submissions included: a) “It is unclear… precisely what basis [the Appellant] has for making [the] allegations, which amount, in substance, to an accusation that the OFT and its officials have been telling lies in order deliberately to conceal the portfolio from the Appellant…the OFT vigorously denies the Appellant’s allegation of collusion or other impropriety between the OFT and the [Commissioner]. b) “As the OFT has repeatedly explained to the Appellant the OFT did not hold the portfolio, and it was not and never has been, held on the OFT’s behalf. The OFT has transparently explained the reasons why it is entirely unsurprising that that is so, though it has also searched for the information and made enquiries with the OFT staff who were involved in the judging process, whilst they were still employed by the OFT.” - 12 - EA/2010/0146c) “Indeed, having regard to the OFT’s limited role in relation to the Awards, and the likelihood that even those members of the judging panel who were OFT employees were (on proper analysis) adjudicating in their personal capacities rather than on the OFT’s behalf, it is likely that the portfolio has never at any time been held by or on behalf of the OFT. However, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether that is so, because all that matters for present purposes is whether the portfolio was held by or on behalf of the OFT at the time of the request.” d) At the hearing, Mr Bates for the OFT argued that the OFT did not play a part in the article that was written and its only role was in relation to providing an award to the journalist. It was not making a judgment about a particular trader and so would not have needed to keep records in relation to this. 25. He explained that the competition had been going on for some time and had been sponsored by a third party. The OFT had therefore been invited to enter a pre-existing arrangement and this suggested something about the level of control between TSI and any sponsor. It would have been unlikely that the OFT would stipulate that it would want a right to any information held in connection with any competition to be obtainable at any time it wished. In the absence of a contract, the OFT has no way of providing the information to the Appellant. The Task of the Tribunal 26. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by section 58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or whether he should have exercised any discretion he had differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. 27. The burden of proof in this appeal lies with the Appellant, who must satisfy the Tribunal that it is more likely than not that the decision made by the OFT and upheld by the Respondent was wrong. In making its decision, we may only consider evidence relevant to the issue before it, of whether the requested information is held. 28. Accordingly, as was made clear at the case management hearing and at the hearing, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide other matters raised by the Appellant, such as his alleging a ‘cover up’ concerning the Consumer Journalist of the Year Award 2007 competition itself. We also need not address his concerns about the Respondent’s investigation. As an independent judicial body, we have looked into the matter afresh, independently considering the evidence and arguments put to us at the hearing and in writing. The Questions for the Tribunal 29. The Questions for the Tribunal in this appeal are: a. Did the OFT hold the information? b. Does TSI hold information on behalf of OFT? The relevant law 30. A person who has made a request to a ‘public authority’ for information is, (subject to the provisions of FOIA), entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds the information described in the request, and if so to have that information communicated to him. (S.1(1) of FOIA). 31. The term “holds” for these purposes includes information held by someone else, but “on behalf of” the authority. (S.3(2)FOIA). - 13 - EA/2010/014632. In deciding whether information is “held” by a public authority for the purposes of s.1 FOIA, previous decisions have applied a test, established in Linda Bromley v Information Commissioner & the Environment Agency (EA/2006/0072). In that case, the Tribunal observed in paragraph 13: “There can seldom be absolute certainty that information relevant to a request does not remain undiscovered somewhere within a public authority's records. This is particularly the case with a large national organisation … whose records are inevitably spread across a number of departments in different locations. … the test to be applied was not certainty but the balance of probabilities. This is the normal standard of proof and clearly applies to Appeals before this Tribunal in which the Information Commissioner's findings of fact are reviewed. We think that its application requires us to consider a number of factors including the quality of the public authority's initial analysis of the request, the scope of the search that it decided to make on the basis of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency with which the search was then conducted. Other matters may affect our assessment at each stage, including, for example, the discovery of materials elsewhere whose existence or content point to the existence of further information within the public authority which had not been brought to light. Our task is to decide, on the basis of our review of all of these factors, whether the public authority is likely to be holding relevant information beyond that which has already been disclosed.” (Emphasis added.) 33. This Tribunal agrees that since it is difficult to establish with certainty whether a large organisation ‘holds’ requested information, the Tribunal needs to decide this ‘on the balance of probabilities’. Depending on the circumstances, factors in reaching the decision might logically include the analysis of the request, what searches have been carried out and the rationale for the extent and method of search. A. Did the OFT hold the information? 34. We accept: a. The relevant judges only ever held the requested information when it was handed to them in hard copy and that this was limited to the few hours in which they sifted through and deliberated upon the award. This would seem to be a perfectly normal way to conduct a sift process and we have been given no real reason to doubt it; and b. This was the normal practice for the awards. c. The OFT asked the judges to confirm that the portfolios had been handed back to TSI after the deliberations and they did so. 35. Whilst we were told by the OFT’s representative that the OFT conducted a search for the information, we were not given any details to support this. Regardless of this, the facts found above are sufficient to convince us that on the balance of probabilities, the OFT did not hold the information at the time of the request. 36. The Appellant makes various assertions that are unsubstantiated and which we do not accept. These include: a. That it can be deduced from the TSI email to the OFT of 28 March 2008 (in para.17(a)), that TSI believed the OFT possessed the requested documents at the time of the request. b. TSI colluded with the OFT to ensure the latter got rid of the requested information. Nothing in the OFT email of 28 March 2008, illustrating its intention to consult with TSI regarding the reply to the Appellant, or the TSI email of 28 April 2008 justifies the Appellant’s suspicions. The section 45 code which the Appellant referred us to envisages that public authorities will consult with interested third parties. c. The combination of the communications from the OFT to the Appellant and those between the OFT and TSI, all at around the time of the request, reveal a changing story designed to conceal whether the information was held. (See para.s 17(a) to (c).) - 14 - EA/2010/0146Whilst the initial response of 31 March (that the disclosure of the information was not the OFT’s decision) could have been better phrased so as to respond properly to an FOIA request, on the facts, it is highly likely that the OFT meant that the decision was not theirs to make because the information was held by the TSI who had run the competition. We do not think that any of the communications, such as the email of 3 April explaining that none of the judges had kept the papers indicates a change of story. The statement that the awards were from TSI not the OFT supports the OFT judges being required to hand back the material to the TSI after the event. d. The arguments proffered in para.19(a) above about the partnership’s motive to suppress scandal. These are baseless and highly uncompelling - we do not accept that if it were proven that a prizewinner within the awards ceremony had published an untruthful article, this would expose the OFT to scandal. We do not accept that the OFT were motivated to suppress scandal and so conspired with TSI to suppress disclosure of the portfolio. We also consider it extremely unlikely that the requested portfolio would contain information revealing ammunition to fuel a scandal. e. That the 12 November 2007 press release (in para.17(d) above) could not have been drafted without the OFT having had the requested information in its possession after the competition. Sight of the portfolio would not have been needed to produce the press release. It does not set out any such a level of detail. f. There has to be a reasonable suspicion of cover up because the OFT did not reply properly to his request for five weeks. The delay does not cause real suspicion, and, in any case, the relevant official who replied on 6 May 2008 explained that she had been on holiday. (See para.s 8 and 19 above.) 37. The Appellant argues that the OFT should have kept the requested information as part of its proper records. However, the question before us is what the authority actually held, not what it should have held. Perhaps, if the normative position were so strong it would inform our expectation of what the OFT actually held. However, in this case we do not agree that the OFT had any reason to have kept the requested information. We do not see why it would have been necessary for auditing - the judges of the event were not being audited. For the reasons discussed in paragraph 47 below, we also do not accept any requirement under the section 45 and 46 codes. The idea that the OFT would need to keep for posterity these types of portfolios to ensure the credibility of the judges for any event they sponsor seems far-fetched. We would have expected records for the expenditure (of nearly £23,000) on funding the events and these existed and were disclosed to the Appellant. However, that is something quite different. 38. We do not accept any of the other evidence put to us indicates that the Appellant has successfully challenged the credibility of the OFT officials. Accordingly, on the balance of probabilities, the OFT did not hold the information requested. B. Does TSI hold information on behalf of OFT? 39. We have not been told whether TSI holds the requested information. If it does not, then we do not need to consider whether the OFT has any form of rights to have the information. Even assuming it does, or did so at the time of the request, we find that there is nothing to indicate that TSI holds any of the information requested on behalf of the OFT or Consumer Direct. 40. We accept and consider as key factors that: a. The awards were run by TSI; b. Whilst the OFT provided significant sponsorship in the ways set out above, and Consumer Direct nominated candidates for awards, they did so to pursue their joint interests in encouraging and improving awareness in consumer rights and protection. - 15 - EA/2010/0146The press release of 12 November 2007 makes clear: ""We would not be able to get the Consumer Direct message out so widely without such an excellent network of consumer journalists across the country…It seems absolutely right to reward them for their efforts."" The OFT did not provide sponsorship in order to have rights to require the information within portfolios of candidates for the relevant awards – it is hard to see how these would be helpful to pursuing their broader objectives; and c. There is nothing in writing explaining any terms for OFT sponsorship or anything else relevant to our case. 41. As for the nature of the relationship between the two parties, press releases described the TSI as being in partnership with Consumer Direct. Given there was no written contract or Memorandum of Understanding, we suspect this was not a legal arrangement, but a looser description as might be expected in a press release. It is clear that TSI ran the awards and the OFT helped out. This might be called a partnership of sorts, but not one where we would expect TSI to be holding information on behalf of OFT, its sponsor. 42. The emails between the TSI and OFT do not support any argument of TSI being any form of agent of the OFT. TSI on the other hand, did request of the OFT not to reply directly to the Appellant (in para.17(a)), but they did so anyway. 43. That TSI seems to have a government website address does not affect our findings. 44. Clearly, the OFT would be able to request the material, but without written terms addressing the point, we find it hard to envisage that TSI would be required to give it to them. Although we were offered no analysis on the point, even had they been so required if the OFT made a request, this would not necessarily be the same thing as TSI holding the information on behalf of the OFT. 45. We agree with the Appellant that the OFT benefitted from the competition. But it is clear that TSI ran it - and not on behalf of another - and that the requested information, if still held by TSI, belongs to it. 46. We find it somewhat surprising that the OFT had nothing in writing that they could present on the basis on which they provided sponsorship. This is unhelpful to us in our need to ascertain the nature of the relationship. We suspect it is not good practice. However, whilst we find it regrettable, we also find it believable. 47. Whilst the Appellant suggested that given the existence of the section 45 and 46 codes, there was doubt as to whether the OFT were telling the truth, we do not agree. (Presumably by this he meant that he suspected there was indeed something in writing. He expected the contract would state the TSI to be “accountable to provide information for FOIA purposes”, and that in relation to the section 45 code, “the OFT were not allowed to agree with the TSI for the latter not to provide it with information if required under FOIA”.) As an aside, we note that we do not think the codes are particularly relevant here. To suggest that a public authority need to neurotically collect records of all its interactions with others purely for FOIA stretches our understanding of the codes. The portfolios did not belong to OFT and their collection would not support the discharge of its or Consumer Direct’s functions or help the institutional memory in any meaningful way. As for the section 45 code, the OFT have not argued that it would not hand over the information because of TSI’s expectation of confidentiality based on some agreement they had for the OFT not to disclose TSI’s information. They argue they do not hold the information to disclose it. Further, neither code requires the parties to enter into agreements specifically to ensure that information belonging to TSI should be said to be held on behalf of the OFT. 48. There are no other arguments or evidence that the Appellant has put forward that persuade us in any way of his position on either ground. Conclusion 49. The Tribunal concludes that on the available evidence, the Second Respondent did not hold the information within the meaning of FOIA that was requested by the Appellant at the time of the request. This is because the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence that, the judges from the OFT - 16 - EA/2010/0146and Consumer Direct handed back to TSI the relevant portfolios after having made their deliberations and that if TSI kept the information, it did not do so on behalf of the OFT. 50. The Appeal is dismissed. 51. Our decision is unanimous. Other matters 52. Promulgation of this decision was delayed due to illness. Accordingly, a notification of the outcome of the appeal was given on 19 July. Rights to seek an appeal are effective from 27 September 2011.

Cases: Linda Bromley and Others and Information Commissioner v Environment Agency (EA/2006/0072) DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal rejects the appeal and upholds the decision notice dated 1 June 2010. Christopher Hughes Judge Dated this 31st day of December 2010Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 Reasons Introduction 1. This appeal to the Tribunal arose as a result of litigation conducted by the Appellant which reached the Court of Appeal in which the Appellant wished to obtain access to the wills of certain recently deceased members of the royal family. The Tribunal was informed that this litigation is still before the Courts and a number of issues are being considered within that litigation. This Tribunal was concerned with one specific issue which came to light in the course of the litigation and which the Appellant pursued through a FOIA request. 2. On 8 February 2008, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in Brown v Executors of the Estate of HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother [2008] EWCA Civ 56. That judgment contained, at §28, the following summary statement by the presiding judge in that case, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Philips of Worth Matravers: “Before and after the death of Princess Margaret there were discussions between the Palace, Farrers, the Attorney General's Secretariat, and the Attorney General and the court which reviewed what Mr Hinks described as the practice of sealing royal wills. The senior district judge was involved who sought the views of the former President. Ultimately “a quite lengthy document” was agreed that was reviewed and approved by the former President. The process that this contained involved a system of “checks and balances” that was highly confidential. The primary object of the process was to protect the privacy of the sovereign. Thus when the two applications came before the former President she had an understanding of the background that she would not otherwise have had.” 3. According to material supplied by the Appellant, the “quite lengthy document” referred to above had been mentioned during the trial giving rise to the hearing in the Court of Appeal. The Appellant relied on the transcript of the trial where a document, tentatively described as a “practice direction” is referred to in exchanges between counsel and Sir Mark Potter, the then President of the Family Division. 4. In the light of the information he had gathered from the proceedings in Court January 2009, the Appellant approached Her Majesty’s Courts Service (“HMCS”) with requests under FOIA for “the document known as the ‘practice direction’ for the closure of the Royal Wills”. HMCS responded on 19 January 2009 stating that no such practice direction exists within HMCS.Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 5. The request for information which is the subject of this appeal was made initially in a letter dated 5 March 2009 to the Master of the Rolls for the “quite lengthy document” referred to in the extract from the Court of Appeal’s judgment set out above. The Personal Secretary to the Master of the Rolls replied on 17 March 2009, in similar terms to the response of HMCS to the January 2009 request. 6. On 23 March 2009, the Appellant emailed the relevant officer of the Data Access & Compliance Unit of the Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”), attaching his letter to the Master of the Rolls of 5 March 2009. His email emphasised that this application for the “quite lengthy document” was new and distinct from his previous applications for the “the document known as the ‘practice direction’ for the closure of the Royal Wills”. He received an automated reply acknowledging his email. Over the following months the Appellant made a number requests for the information but received no substantive reply. Finally on 16 November the MOJ re-issued its response of 19 January 2009. 7. On 17 November 2009, the Appellant informed the MOJ that he considered the two requests distinct and that he did not consider his request for the “quite lengthy document” to have been answered by the MOJ’s letter of 19 January 2009. 8. On 30 November 2009, the MOJ wrote to the Appellant to attempt to clarify the position with respect to various issues including the request contained in the letter to the Master of the Rolls dated 5 March 2009 and submitted to the MOJ on 23 March 2009. The MOJ explained that it had misunderstood and therefore proposed to treat the Appellant’s request as having been made on 17 November 2009. 9. On 15 December 2009, the MOJ sent the Appellant a substantive response to his March 2009 request for the “quite lengthy document”. It stated that the Master of the Rolls, to whom the Appellant’s letter of 5 March 2009 was addressed, was not a public authority. The Appellant’s request of 23 March 2009 was, however, treated as being made to HMCS, for which the MOJ has responsibility. The MOJ confirmed that neither it nor HMCS held the “quite lengthy document”. 10. On 30 December 2009, the Appellant requested an internal review of the MOJ’s decision In his request he claimed that the MOJ’s response had been framed in the way it was because it knew that “the document is held by the Master of the Rolls, the Lord Chief Justice, the Senior District Judge, other judge, person or persons, or institution orAppeal No: EA/2010/0119 institutions, acting on their behalf”. He explained that he was objecting to what he considered to be the withholding of documents based on their being held by the Master of the Rolls or other persons not considered subject to FOIA. 11. On 11 February 2010, the MOJ informed the Appellant that, after an internal review, it was satisfied that the requested information was not held. It stated that it had been unable to find any trace of the document requested by the Appellant and was satisfied that it was not held by them. 12. In June 2009 the Appellant first complained to the Information Commissioner about the MOJ’s failure to respond to the request initially sent to the Master of the Rolls and then to the MOJ. Following an investigation the IC issued a Decision Notice on 1 June 2010. 13. The IC found that:- (i) The Appellant first submitted a valid FOIA request on 23 March 2009 when his letter to the Master of the Rolls was forwarded to the MOJ however the submission of the request to the Master of the Rolls earlier that month was not a valid request since he is not a public authority for FOIA purposes. (ii) The MOJ’s failure to respond substantively to the Appellant’s request of 23 March 2009 until 15 December 2009 therefore placed it in breach of section 10(1) FOIA. (iii) The Commissioner was satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the MOJ had carried out an appropriate search for the “quite lengthy document”. (iv) The Commissioner concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that the information was not held by MOJ/HMCS. The Commissioner considered that the evidence, including the evidence of the court proceedings, did not demonstrate that the MOJ held the document. The MOJ had conducted a sufficient search, during which it had identified the existence of the requested information within another public authority. There was no basis for suspecting that the MOJ was concealing its holding of the document. (v) The MOJ’s failure to inform the Appellant of its discovery, through its enquiries of Farrer & Co (the solicitors acting for the Executors of the wills in question), that the document he had requested was held by the Attorney General’s Office constituted a failure to conform to the ‘Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs’ Code of Practice on the discharge of public authorities’Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 functions under Part I of the Freedom of Information Act 2000’, issued under section 45 of FOIA. The Appeal 14. The Appellant was dissatisfied with this outcome and lodged an appeal. The Appellant raised six issues in his appeal:- <U+F0B7> The IC had failed to consider the Master of the Rolls non-judicial functions in relation to the applicability of FOIA to him. <U+F0B7> The IC failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify his finding that adequate searches had been made. <U+F0B7> The IC failed to give sufficient weight to evidence that the document is likely to be held or have been held by the Courts Service or the Judiciary on behalf of the Courts Service. <U+F0B7> The decision notice failed to adequately censure the MOJ for delay and poor administration. <U+F0B7> The IC demonstrated a lack of objectivity, showed bias and the regular contact with Government departments had dulled his objectivity. <U+F0B7> The IC failed to consider the delays and to consider whether an enforcement notice was justified. 15. The ICO and the MOJ resisted all grounds of the appeal and submitted detailed arguments on each point. 16. In addressing the core question underlying the appeal – whether or not the MOJ held the “quite lengthy document” which the Appellant sought; the ICO relied on a series of exchanges which it had with the MOJ and the information which the MOJ had supplied about its attempts to find the document. In the course of these exchanges the MOJ explained that: (i) It contacted the Knowledge Information Liaison Officer at the Royal Courts of Justice (“RCJ”), referring that officer to the relevant passage in the Court of Appeal judgment set out above. (ii) That officer explained that HMCS had received and responded to a previous request worded as being for a “practice direction for the closure of the Royal Wills”, which differed from this request for the “quite lengthy document”.Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 (iii) The RCJ conducted a search for the “quite lengthy document” without success. (iv) Ms Wright, of the Data Access & Compliance Unit at the MOJ, then met with a Senior District Judge at the RCJ, who confirmed that he was not aware of the existence of this document within HMCS. (v) The MOJ then contacted Farrer & Co, the solicitors involved in the trial(s) referred to earlier in this Response during which the “quite lengthy document” had been mentioned, asking for further information which may assist in locating the “quite lengthy document”. The MOJ was informed that the “quite lengthy document” was dated 2002 and that the Attorney General held a copy. (vi) Based on this refined description, the MOJ then researched HMCS but were still unable to locate the “quite lengthy document”. 17. The ICO concluded “In the light of the fact that the public authority had identified the requested information and that it was held by the Attorney General’s Office, the Commissioner is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the public authority had carried out an appropriate search within the public authority.” 18. In the light of this search history and its results the ICO and MOJ submitted that on the balance of probabilities the information sought was not held by the MOJ. 19. The question for the Tribunal is whether the Commissioner erred in finding that, on the balance of probabilities, the MOJ did not hold the requested information. Oral evidence 20. In determining this question in addition to the documentary evidence supplied by the parties the Tribunal considered the oral evidence of Richard Goodman Head of Disclosure for MOJ and Luigi Leo who discharges the role of “Knowledge Information Liaison Officer” at the Royal Courts of Justice. Between them they gave a clear exposition of the systematic way in which the search for the document was carried out. The areas within the Courts Service where it was possible that such a document would be or would be likely to be kept were identified, The Probate Registry, the Royal Courts of Justice and the Principal Registry of the Family Division. This focussed approach identified the Senior District Judge of the Family Division as the person most likely to have knowledge of documents similar to the one sought. He was able to establish thatAppeal No: EA/2010/0119 all documents relevant to the sealing of royal wills were held in one place. From a consideration of the documents he had identified and following consultation with solicitors acting in the litigation concerning the wills (in order to obtain specific information about a document not fully described in the litigation) it was established that none of the documents in the file was of the correct date to be the document sought by the Appellant. 21. Although the Appellant raised a number of arguments concerning the search he was unable to present any evidence to suggest that the document was held by the MOJ. He relied on the absence of detailed records of the searches conducted by the MOJ. A formal written of every step in the search process is not a requirement of the public authority. The individual who had on the spot responsibility for the search, Mr Leo, was confident and clear in his evidence. He had a practical understanding of how to approach the challenge of searching within the Royal Courts of Justice for a document described in the Court of Appeal as a “quite lengthy document” but not otherwise fully characterised. His answers were ready and clear and he was frank in his acknowledgement of matters of which he was unaware. His researches into the nature of the document and his knowledge of the RCJ, its organisation and staff were effective in bringing about a clearer understanding of the document and finding the file in which it would have been kept, if it had been held. The Tribunal found his evidence persuasive and convincing. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that an adequate search for the document was conducted. Findings 22. Given that such a search was carried out the Tribunal needs to consider, in the light of this finding, whether on the balance of probabilities the MOJ did hold the document at the relevant time. 23. The evidence indicates that the document was created in 2002 in consultation with the then President of the Family Division. The Tribunal is satisfied that, at that stage, if the document had been kept by the then President, it would have been retained with the other documents relating to royal wills which were identified by the Senior District Judge. The relevant file was kept in a locked safe under the control of the Senior District Judge. He had been in post since 2004. He confirmed during the search process that he did not recognise the document and was satisfied that the material requested was not within theAppeal No: EA/2010/0119 file that he held. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the document was at the time of the search there was no retention of the document within the MOJ; the evidence strongly indicates that from 2004 and in all likelihood before that the document was not held within the MOJ. 24. While the Appellant until a late stage relied on the comments in the High Court and Court of Appeal to argue that this indicated that the Judges in the wills litigation had seen the document, a close analysis of the text of the decision gave no grounds for such a conclusion – a point the Appellant conceded in the hearing. The Tribunal was satisfied that there were no grounds for believing that, during the course of the Wills litigation, the document came into the possession of either the judges or the MOJ. 25. These two circumstances (the creation of the document, the Wills litigation) are the identifiable points at which the document could have come into the possession of the MOJ. There is no evidence upon which the Tribunal could conclude that, at those times, it did. The question before the Tribunal is whether the document was in the possession of the MOJ at 23 March 2009. The Tribunal is satisfied, based on the adequacy of the search in 2009 and the absence of evidence that the document came into the possession of the MOJ prior to then, that the “quite lengthy document” was not held at the time of the Appellant’s request. 26. The Tribunal was informed, towards the end of the hearing, that a copy of the document concerned was supplied to the MOJ by the Attorney-General’s Office in early November 2010. The document was supplied in connection with a review the MOJ is carrying out of probate procedure. The Appellant had previously been aware that the document was held by the Attorney-General and indeed had submitted a request to the Attorney- General for the disclosure of the information. 27. Turning now to the specific grounds listed in the grounds of appeal:- GROUND 1 28. The Appellant argued that proper consideration should be given to the wider responsibilities of the Master of Rolls which go beyond his role as a judge and in particular his statutory responsibility for Chancery records. It is clear from the legislative history that this responsibility it as matter of antiquarian interest and relates to the court records of Chancery prior to the re-organisation of the Courts in the 19th century. WhileAppeal No: EA/2010/0119 the Master of the Rolls has many responsibilities in addition to presiding in the Court of Appeal, as a simple question of statutory construction he is not a person listed as a public authority under Schedule 1 of the FOIA and therefore he is not a person to whom an application under FOIA lies. In any event when the application was received in his office in March 2009 it was appropriately transferred to the MOJ which does have responsibilities under Schedule 1 of FOIA. The subsequent delay in handling the application was due to the MOJ and the responsibilities of the Master of the Rolls do not enter into the matter. Accordingly the Tribunal was satisfied that this head of the appeal was entirely without merit. Ground 2 29. “The IC failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify his finding that adequate searches had been made”. The Tribunal noted that there was significant evidence before the IC upon which he made his decision. Tribunal has concluded (see above) on all the evidence before it (much of which was before the Information Commissioner) that, on the balance of probabilities, the information sought was not held by the MOJ at all the relevant dates raised during the hearing. Accordingly this ground of appeal does not succeed in persuading the Tribunal to set aside the IC’s decision. Ground 3 30. “The IC failed to give sufficient weight to evidence that the document is likely to be held or have been held by the Courts Service or the Judiciary on behalf of the Courts Service.” The question before the Tribunal was whether or not on the relevant date (for these purposes 23 March 2009 when the request was forwarded from the Office of the Master of the Rolls) the information was held. The test the Tribunal applied is that laid down in Bromley the balance of probabilities and has satisfied itself that the information was not held at that date (see above). The Tribunal heard detailed evidence of the searches which had been made and the specific and highly valuable contribution of one member of the Judiciary to ensuring that the search was effective. During the course of the hearing the Appellant reconsidered the relevant transcript and judgement from the High Court and Court of Appeal proceedings and concluded that they did not amount to evidence that any members of those courts had indeed seen the document sought in the course of the Appellant’s litigation. In the light of this the Appellant abandoned his argument with respect to the judiciary.Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 Ground 4 31. “The ICO failed to accurately and fully reflect the timeline of events, and as a result the decision notice misrepresents events and fails to adequately censure the MOJ for delays, and the poor quality of administration”. There is no obligation on the ICO to chronicle every twist and turn of the path in investigating how a public authority has discharged its obligations. The narrative set out by the ICO is amply sufficient for the purpose of investigating the Appellant’s complaint. The Tribunal noted that the ICO had made an adverse finding against the MOJ in the decision notice with respect to a failure to comply with the duty laid down by s10(1) of FOIA to respond within 20 days to a request for information. It further recorded that the MOJ was in breach of the code of practice. In the light of this the Tribunal is satisfied that in this respect the ICO properly discharged his responsibilities. This ground of appeal has no merit. Ground 5 32. ”The ICO demonstrated a lack of objectivity in the conduct of their investigations.” In his submissions the Appellant identified an excessive reliance on the MOJ by the ICO in investigating the matter and an expression of sympathy (during the course of the investigation) for the difficulties which the MOJ encountered. However the ICO made adverse findings against the MOJ and concluded that the delays involved were unacceptable. The Appellant failed to adduce any substantive evidence of lack of objectivity. Ground 6 33. “The ICO failed in the DN to fairly assess and record the delays and administrative failings of the MOJ, or to consider if in the wider context an enforcement notice may be merited”. The statutory framework of FOIA is clear. S57(1) provides for an appeal against a decision notice either by the complainant (as in this case) or the public authority. Where an information notice or enforcement notice has been served the public authority may (under S57(2)) also appeal against that. There is no free-standing right of a complainant to appeal against a decision not to issue an information or enforcement notice. Accordingly this ground of appeal is invalid.Appeal No: EA/2010/0119 Conclusion 34. As a result of our findings the Tribunal concludes that the ICO was correct in determining that the information sought was not held and accordingly we uphold the decision notice. 35. Our decision is unanimous. 36. An appeal against this decision must be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person seeking permission to appeal must make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of receipt of this decision. Such an application must identify the error or errors of law in the decision and state the result the party is seeking. Relevant forms and guidance for making an application can be found on the Tribunals website at: www.informationtribunal.gov.uk Christopher Hughes OBE Judge Dated: 31st December 2010Case no: EA/2010/0119 IN THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) RULING on an APPLICATION for PERMISSION to APPEAL By Mr Robert Brown 1. This is an application dated 6 December 2010 by Mr Robert Brown for permission to appeal against the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) (“FTT”) dated 31st December 2010. 2. That decision dismissed the appeal of Mr Brown and upheld the Information Commissioner’s (IC) Decision Notice FS50256367 of 1 June 2010. 3. The right to appeal against a decision of the FTT is restricted to those cases which raise a point of law. The FTT accepts that in form this is a valid application for permission to appeal under rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 as amended (“the Rules”). 4. The FTT has considered whether to review its decision under rule 43(1) of the Rules, taking into account the overriding objective in rule 2, and has decided not to review its decision because the grounds of the application do not raise an error of law for the reasons stated below. 5. The Appellant believes the Tribunal (and the Information Commissioner) erred in concluding that the Ministry of Justice, the Additional Party in the original appeal, did not hold the information he was requesting at the relevant time. 6. His original appeal to the Tribunal was dated 28 June 2010 in respect of information requested from the Additional Party in March 2009. 7. The Tribunal concluded that his requests were for information which was not held by the Additional Party at the relevant time. 8. The Appellant in his lengthy Application for Permission to Appeal disputes the findings of the FTT including arguments of law, adequacy of reasons by the FTT and the absence of a transcript obstructing his ability to appeal. 9. The FTT found that the information was not held and gave detailed, logical and cogent reasoning based on the evidence for its decision. 10. The arguments as to law are general points of constitutional or theoretical interest but do not go to the subject matter of the case; whether the information was held or not. The absence of a transcript of proceedings is not a procedural flaw which vitiates the proceedings. 11. The Appellant raises no new issues which ought to be heard by the Upper Tribunal and the claim that the FTT decision did not provide sufficient reasons is completely without foundation.12. The Tribunal is not persuaded that its original decision was incorrect in fact or in law. It follows that the appeal has no prospect of success and that permission to appeal is refused. 13. Under rule 21(3) the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as amended Mr Brown has one month from the date this Ruling was sent to it to lodge the appeal with the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber).

REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. This Appeal arises out of a request for information under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), which the Appellant, Mr Whyte, sent to the Second Respondent, the Ministry of Defence (“MOD”), on 22 May 2010. The request was refined and clarified during the course of correspondence,. Before us it was accepted by both sides that the information requested was the data that formed the basis for a graph, which Mr Whyte had obtained, showing the decay rate, in hours, of Gamma Radiation at ground zero during two Atomic Bomb tests (Pennant and Burgee) carried out by the UK authorities in the South Pacific in 1958 under the code name “Operation Grapple - Z”. We will refer to this as “the Dose Rate Graph”.EA/2011/0178; Decision 2. Section 1 of FOIA provides: “(1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled- (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him.” 3. In this case the MOD informed Mr Whyte that it did not hold the information. Mr Whyte was not satisfied with that response and lodged a complaint with the Information Commissioner. At the end of his investigation into the matter the Information Commissioner concluded that the MOD did not hold the information and that, (apart from one procedural issue, with which we are not concerned on this Appeal) the MOD had handled Mr Whyte’s request properly. The conclusion was recorded in a Decision Notice dated 20 July 2011 (“the Decision Notice”). The Appeal to this Tribunal 4. On 5 August 2011 Mr Whyte appealed against the Decision Notice. The Tribunal’s role on such an appeal is to consider whether or not the Information Commissioner’s decision was “in accordance with the law” (FOIA section 58(1)). If it considers that it was not, it may issue such other notice as it considers appropriate, in substitution for the Decision Notice. The Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the Decision Notice was based. 5. The MOD was joined as a party to the appeal and directions were given for the determination of the appeal at a hearing. In the event the Information Commissioner opted not to appear at the hearing. MrEA/2011/0178; Decision Whyte conducted his own case and Ms Lisa Busch of counsel represented the MOD. The issue to be determined 6. The only issue we have to consider is whether or not the MOD held the requested information at the time of the request. Although we are not bound by other decisions of the Tribunal, there have been a number of earlier cases dealing with the difficulty facing a public authority in cases where it asserts that it does not hold requested information: the difficulty, in effect, of having to prove a negative. In the case of Bromley v Information Commissioner and the Environment Agency (EA/2006/0072) a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal said: “There can seldom be absolute certainty that information relevant to a request does not remain undiscovered somewhere within a public authority's records. This is particularly the case with a large national organisation like the Environment Agency, whose records are inevitably spread across a number of departments in different locations. The Environment Agency properly conceded that it could not be certain that it holds no more information. However, it argued (and was supported in the argument by the Information Commissioner) that the test to be applied was not certainty but the balance of probabilities. This is the normal standard of proof and clearly applies to Appeals before this Tribunal in which the Information Commissioner's findings of fact are reviewed. We think that its application requires us to consider a number of factors including the quality of the public authority's initial analysis of the request, the scope of the search that it decided to make on the basis of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency with which the search was then conducted. Other matters may affect our assessment at each stage, including, for example, the discovery of materials elsewhere whose existence or content point to the existence ofEA/2011/0178; Decision further information within the public authority which had not been brought to light. Our task is to decide, on the basis of our review of all of these factors, whether the public authority is likely to be holding relevant information beyond that which has already been disclosed.” 7. Although, as we have said, we are not bound by that decision it seems to us that it correctly identifies both the test that we should apply and some of the factors which we should take into account in deciding whether, on the facts of this case, we should conclude that the requested information was not held by the MOD at the time when the request was made.

The analysis of the original request, as well as the scope and rigour of the resulting document search, may be assessed by reference to the Information Commissioner’s own investigation (in the form of the correspondence between his office and the MOD, which has been made available to us), and the evidence given by the MOD’s witness on the appeal, Mr Gareth Rowlands. The Information Commissioner’s investigation 9. The Information Commissioner’s investigation took the form of a letter to the MOD dated 10 June 2011, explaining the process of investigation and asking a total of 11 questions.. The MOD’s letter in response of 8 July 2011 explained that the Dose Rate Graph was contained in a document entitled “Operation Grapple Z, Interim Report, Part XII 1958”, which had been retrieved from Atomic Weapons Establishment (“AWE”), which operates the relevant Records Office for the MOD under delegated authority. The letter added that the Interim Report itself could be accessed in the National Archives, where it had previously been lodged at some date prior to 2005 although MrEA/2011/0178; Decision Whyte’s evidence was that only 72 of the 192 pages of the report were accessible. It then said: “The only other search that was made was for the original record (log book) but no information was found. There was no requirement to carry out additional searches as the information in scope is the Interim Report.” In response to a later question it stated that no search had been made of any electronic data because: “The information in scope is the Interim Report now held as a hard copy document/PDF by MOD but the information within it cannot be searched electronically as it is an image file.” Still later it stated: “It is believed that the graph was derived from manually recorded data. A search was made for the original record (log book) but no trace was found. It has been assumed that the manual record was either lost/destroyed at some time after generation of this Interim Report in 1958 containing [the Dose Rate Graph].” 10. On the basis of those responses to its enquiries the Information Commissioner recorded the following conclusion in the Decision Notice: “The Commissioner understands that the complainant may find it frustrating to be in possession of a piece of information, namely [the Dose Rate Graph], which the MOD cannot explain or clarify. However, the Commissioner is mindful that the existence of the graph alone does not guarantee that the MOD would necessarily hold further related information. TheEA/2011/0178; Decision Commissioner accepts that no explanatory information was found in the Interim Report and that it is likely that the original log book data has been destroyed. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, the Commissioner considers that the requested information is not held by the MOD.” Mr Rowland’s evidence 11. Mr Rowland is a Senior Executive Officer within the Defence Equipment and Support function of the MOD. He explained in his witness statement that the UK’s nuclear warhead capability is managed and operated by the Atomic Weapons Establishment (“AWE”) under a contract with the MOD. One result of that arrangement is that AWE holds and maintains extensive historical archives relating to the UK’s nuclear weapons programme. When the MOD receives a freedom of information request relating to this area of activity it liaises with AWE to identify and retrieve potentially relevant information to be reviewed and considered for release. 12. Mr Whyte’s original request generated some correspondence from one of Mr Rowland’s colleagues attempting to explain the significance of some elements of the Dose Rate Graph. Mr Rowland’s witness statement stated, without disclosing the source of his information, that none of the correspondence was based on any raw data used to compile the Dose Rate Graph but relied on general mathematical and scientific knowledge and principles. 13. Mr Rowland also explained in his witness statement that, in the course of carrying out an internal review of the refusal of the information request: “…MOD attempted to identify the source of the information in the [Dose Rate Graph] and locate any raw data which was used to compile the graph. This is likely to have been obtained in an original record or ‘log book’ which, if held, would be stored inEA/2011/0178; Decision either the AWE archive or would have been transferred to [the National Archive]. However, a search of the AWE archives confirmed that they did not hold it. This search was conducted on the two major databases at AWE that include records relating [sic] the UK’s nuclear test programme, and on records held in microfiche form. These included searches based around the names of the nuclear tests and the year they took place.” We comment, in passing, that Mr Rowland provided no basis for his belief as to the likely nature of the raw data and no identification of the source of his information about the way in which AWE had carried out the database searches. The omissions are particularly noticeable in light of what we would call the usual hearsay statement appearing earlier in his witness statement. 14. Mr Rowland explained that not all of the Interim Report had been lodged with the National Archive. It had taken the form of a collation of several stand-alone reports, some of which had been retained by AWE because they remained highly classified. He then concluded: “A subsequent review of the retained parts by an MOD subject- matter expert has confirmed that they contain no relevant information” We observe, again, that the expert in question is not identified as the source of Mr Rowland’s information. 15. Mr Rowland attended the hearing in order to be cross examined. He also answered questions put to him by the Tribunal panel. He answered all questions fully and, as far as we could see, truthfully. We felt that he was trying to assist us in our deliberations. However, there were a number of aspects of the evidence proffered by the MOD which caused us concern. Those concerns informed the questions we put to Mr Rowland. They generated the following additional information: (a) The team that Mr Rowland supervised was responsible for the initial responses to the information request. He was therefore able to confirm, from his own direct knowledge, that a decisionEA/2011/0178; Decision was made, in consultation with his colleagues and his contact at AWE, that the response should take the form of an explanation of the scientific notation appearing on the Dose Rate Graph and that it should not be treated as the kind of question that could be answered by recorded information. (b) It was only when Mr Rowland’s colleague, who was undertaking the internal review, suggested that a search for raw data might provide something useful, that the focus changed to the possible existence of recorded information. The search was carried out by AWE but Mr Rowland was not sure if his team was involved in giving the instruction or whether this was done by the internal review team. He thought it likely that his team did not take an active part in the process at that stage. (c) Mr Rowland had a degree of knowledge about AWE’s records and processes from previous dealings and had used this as the basis for the statements in his witness statement about the nature of the material that may have been retained (an “original record or ‘log book’”) and the structure of the AWE archives. He told us that AWE had two databases. One was called Merlin. He could not recall the name of the other. He believed that paper documents had been scanned but was not sure of the precise structure of the resulting database or what search techniques it could accommodate. (d) The MOD’s contact at AWE was a Marjorie Wilson, who was in charge of the team of people responsible for the archives. Mr Rowland believed that Ms Wilson would have organised the database search. He thought that she searched against the two terms “1958” and “grapple”, but could not be certain and did not know if Ms Wilson would have tried other search terms or techniques. He had not instructed her to do so and had received no report from her as to exactly how she carried out the task. (e) Mr Rowland did not regard the request for a search as imposing a particularly onerous task on AWE and he had confidence thatEA/2011/0178; Decision Ms Wilson would have carried out a “sufficient search” because she and her team had developed a degree of expertise in this area. AWE had a contractual relationship with the MOD and was required to carry out searches for other purposes, such as Parliamentary questions. He considered that it was a professional organisation and that it was part of the relationship for AWE to have carried out the requested search correctly and professionally. (f) Mr Rowland thought that Ms Wilson reported back to him by email. His recollection was that the message simply stated that nothing had been found. Neither then, nor at any other time, did Ms Wilson provide him with any detail about the searches she had carried out. That was not the normal way in which search results were communicated and Mr Rowland did not ask for more information on this occasion. Although he had some communication with Ms Wilson before he finalised his witness statement he did not seek more detail at that stage as to the way in which the search had been conducted and none was volunteered by Ms Wilson. (g) Mr Rowland was not able to help us as to whether either of the relevant databases could be searched by reference, for example, to the name of the author of the relevant part of the Interim Report, or the nature of the data (possibly distinguishing hand written log books from machine generated print outs), or by any broad subject matter. When pressed he replied that he simply believed that the search had encompassed everything it needed to. (h) No search had been made of the MOD’s own records because Mr Rowland believed that there would be nothing outside the archive that had been transferred to AWE. He did not think that any records maintained for the purposes of handling claims brought by veterans who had been present at the tests would include information which was not also in the AWE archives. HeEA/2011/0178; Decision had confidence that any radiation level materials would be held within those archives and nowhere else. (i) Mr Rowland explained that parts of the Interim Report, which had previously been classified as secret, had subsequently been de-classified, with the result that they had been released to the National Archive. The de-classified elements included the part of the Interim Report containing the Dose Rate Graph. He did not believe that the retained parts contained anything relevant, although he accepted that a list of documentary material released in response to another freedom of information request did include some documents that appeared from their titles to refer to radioactivity sampling in relation to Project Grapple even though they were not recorded as being available in the National Archive. (j) The “subject matter expert” who, according to the witness statement, had reviewed the retained parts of the Interim Report and advised Mr Rowland that they did not contain any relevant information was a Ms Kirsten Greest, who had both the security clearance to inspect the material and the expertise in nuclear technology to make the assessment. Submissions on whether documents held by the MOD 16. Mr Whyte informed us that, as a young service man in 1958, he was ordered to enter ground zero two hours after detonation of the bombs in Operation Grapple to clear debris. He worked there for two hours, wearing no special protective clothing. He had, he said, a ‘film badge’ for monitoring radiation levels which went missing. When he returned his vehicle to base, bearing the materials he had collected, a second person, who he believed was one of the scientists working on the project appeared in full protective clothing and took over his vehicle and its contents. Mr Whyte believes that meticulous measurements were taken at the time and that his exposure on that occasion to the radiation levels which must therefore have been recorded has put hisEA/2011/0178; Decision long term health at risk. He has a number of suspicions about the way he has been treated, both in relation to the loss of radiation measuring equipment issued to him at the time and what he believes have been manoeuvres to prevent him from subsequently discovering the truth of the contamination to which he believes he was exposed. 17. This information was given to us in the original Grounds of Appeal and during Mr Whyte’s oral submissions during the hearing. It was not presented as evidence and was not tested in cross examination. Much of what he told us was also irrelevant to the very narrow issue under consideration in this appeal. It is not our role to consider how other enquiries or information requests have been handled. We are limited, quite properly, to deciding whether the Ministry of Defence was justified in refusing this particular information request on the basis that at the time it did not hold the specific information requested. We nevertheless feel that we should record our disappointment at the relaxed attitude displayed by the MOD in providing us with information about the steps that it took to search for the information. As we have indicated in our summary of Mr Rowland’s evidence, including his answers to our questions, the MOD proffered a witness who did not have sufficient direct knowledge of the facts to provide the level of detail that we believe we needed in order to determine the issue. Nor did he provide us with sufficient information as to what he was informed by those who may have had that knowledge. It matters not whether Mr Whyte’s suspicions are justified. Just the fact that he may have been exposed to serious contamination at a time when its impact on long term health was not so well understood as it is today means that he was, in our view, entitled to expect a more rigorous approach to the document search than was apparent from the incomplete and imprecise evidence that was placed before us. We think that he was also entitled to expect the Information Commissioner to have done more than to accept, without any further testing, the answers he was given to his questions by the MOD.EA/2011/0178; Decision 18. Counsel for the MOD argued that Mr Whyte had not adduced any evidence to show that the requested information was still in existence and that it was entirely plausible that it had been lost or destroyed some time after the Interim Report had been completed some 50 years ago. She suggested that, if the raw data on which the Dose Rate Graph had been based had existed, it would have been released to the National Archives, and made available for public inspection, at the same time as the Interim Report in which that graph appeared. The fact that it did not appear in the National Archives gave rise to an inference, she said, that it no longer exists. In response to our concern that we had not received evidence from the person who actually conducted the search, or been provided with either instructions or a written report of the searches conducted and the results achieved, counsel for the MOD reminded us that AWE was contractually bound to perform an effective search and we should not lightly conclude that it had failed to do so. In our view that submission gives insufficient weight to the importance of the instruction that AWE received; instructions on which we received very limited evidence indeed. 19. In a written submission sent to the Tribunal after the hearing, at the Tribunal’s request, to deal with two points of detail that had not been fully addressed at the time, the MOD volunteered the information that the other documents concerning Operation Grapple had been sent by AWE to the MOD, which had satisfied itself that they did not contain any information on radiological measurements at Ground Zero after the Pennant and Burgee explosions. Counsel for the MOD submitted that it should not be necessary for it to incur further expense to the public purse by being required to confirm this in a witness statement, since the inference which the Tribunal is invited to draw is self-evidently a sound one, given what its counsel described as the “entirely adequate” search that had been conducted.EA/2011/0178; Decision Our conclusion 20. The document search may have been adequate. It may even have been comprehensive, as counsel for the MOD had previously argued in her skeleton argument. Our difficulty is that we have not been provided with sufficient evidence to be satisfied whether it was or not. For the reasons indicated in our summary of the answers Mr Rowland provided to us, we consider that the witness proffered by the MOD was too distant from the search to provide a reliable account of it from his own knowledge and that his evidence on the information received from those who were closer was too imprecise and incomplete to demonstrate that the search had been conducted with the rigour and precision which we believe (adopting the test set out in Bromley) is required before we could consider concluding that, on a balance of probabilities, the recorded information no longer existed. 21. In the light of that conclusion we propose that this decision be treated as preliminary and that the MOD be given an opportunity to remedy the defects and omissions in its evidence, which we have indicated. We believe that it should be possible to provide that evidence within 28 days and that the parties should then seek agreement as to whether the appeal should be determined in a further hearing or on the papers. However, we will entertain any alternative proposals the parties may wish to make, provided they are presented to the Tribunal in writing within 14 days of the date of this decision.

The appeal is dismissed. 2. The Penalty Notice dated 19 August 2019 is confirmed. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is a data controller within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”). As such, it is required to comply with the Data Protection (Charges 1 and Information) Regulations 2018 (“the Regulations”)2. As a “tier 1” organisation, the Appellant’s fee was £40. 4. The Appellant failed to provide the Respondent with the information required by regulation 2 (3) of the Regulations or to pay to the Respondent the Data Protection Fee required by regulation 2 (2) of the Regulations by the compliance date of 2 July 2018. 5. The Respondent served a Notice of Intent on 27 March 2019 and, in the absence of any representations from the Appellant, served a Penalty Notice of £400 on 19 August 2019. 6. The Appellant has appealed to this Tribunal on the basis that its default was an innocent mistake and asks that the penalty be revoked/varied by the Tribunal. Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 12 September 2019 relies on grounds that he was on leave at the time the original reminder was sent and did not receive that email. Thereafter the Appellant was involved in personal litigation which was a source of considerable stress and rendered him unable to attend to the day to day ‘minutiae’ of his practice. The Appellant has provided a court order dated 7 January 2019 under which he was required to pay an agreed settlement of £120,000. The Appellant further submits that he did not receive the Notice of Intent. 8. The Respondent’s Response dated 15 October 2019 resists the appeal. She submits that the Penalty regime has been established by Parliament and that there is 1 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents 2 The Regulations were made under s. 137 DPA. See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/480/contents/made 2no requirement to issue reminders (although a reminder was fact been sent in this case). It is accepted that the Appellant’s failure to comply with the Regulations was due to an oversight, but it is submitted that the imposition of a Penalty was appropriate in all the circumstances. The Respondent notes that the Appellant had been a data controller prior to the commencement of the Regulations and had paid the relevant fees under the earlier legislation so should have had relevant administrative systems in place. It is submitted that the level of penalty is appropriate. 9. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 50 pages. The Law 10. The Regulations came into force on 25 May 2018. They replace the previously applicable regulations, made in 2000. Regulation 2 requires a data controller to pay an annual charge to the Information Commissioner (unless their data processing is exempt). It also requires the data controller to supply the Information Commissioner with specified information so that she can determine the relevant charge, based on turnover and staff numbers. 11. A breach of the Regulations is a matter falling under s. 149 (5) of the DPA. Section 155 (1) of the DPA provides that the Information Commissioner may serve a Penalty Notice on a person who breaches their duties under the Regulations. S. 158 of the DPA requires the Information Commissioner to set a fixed penalty for such a breach, which she has done in her publicly-available Regulatory Action Policy3. The specified penalty for a tier 3 organisation which breached regulation 2(2) is £4,000. The statutory maximum penalty is £4,350, which will be appropriate where there are aggravating factors. 12. Schedule 16 to the DPA makes provision as to the procedure for serving Penalty Notices, which includes the service of a Notice of Intent written inviting representations. 13. An appeal against a Penalty Notice is brought under s. 162(1)(d) DPA. S.162(3) DPA provides that “A person who is given a penalty notice or a penalty variation notice may appeal to the Tribunal against the amount of the penalty specified in the notice, whether or not the person appeals against the notice.” 14. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is established by s. 163 DPA, as follows: 3 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 3163 Determination of appeals (1) Subsections (2) to (4) apply where a person appeals to the Tribunal under section 162(1) or (3). (2) The Tribunal may review any determination of fact on which the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought was based. (3) If the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice or decision involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that the Commissioner ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute another notice or decision which the Commissioner could have given or made. (4) Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. … 15. I note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. 16. It is increasingly common for the General Regulatory Chamber to determine appeals against financial penalties imposed by civil regulators. In appeals against Fixed Penalty Notices issued by the Pensions Regulator, tribunal judges have frequently adopted the approach of asking whether a defaulting Appellant has a “reasonable excuse” for their default, notwithstanding the fact that this concept is not expressly referred to in the legislation. This approach was approved by the Upper Tribunal in The Pensions Regulator v Strathmore Medical Practice [2018] UKUT 104 (AAC).4 There is much case law concerning what is and is not a “reasonable excuse” and it is inevitably fact-specific. An oft-cited definition is the one used by the VAT Tribunal (as it then was) in The Clean Car Company v HMRC (LON/90/1381X) as follows: “…the question of whether a particular trader had a reasonable excuse should be judged by the standards of reasonableness which one would expect to be exhibited by a taxpayer who had a responsible attitude to his duties as a taxpayer, but who in other respects shared such attributes of the particular appellant as the tribunal considered relevant to the situation being considered. Thus though such a taxpayer would give a reasonable priority to complying with his duties in regard to tax and would conscientiously seek to ensure that his returns were accurate and made timeously, his age and experience, his 4 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5acf131ee5274a76be66c11a/MISC_3112_2017-00.pdf 4health or the incidence of some particular difficulty or misfortune and, doubtless, many other facts, may all have a bearing on whether, in acting as he did, he acted reasonably and so had a reasonable excuse….” The Facts 17. There appears to be no dispute between the parties as to the facts in this case. The Appellant implicitly accepts that it received the Penalty Notice, although not the Notice of Intent. The Appellant does not say whether he received a second payment reminder sent by post on 20 August 2018. 18. The Appellant expressly accepts that he was in breach of his legal obligations under the Regulations on the relevant date. 19. The Appellant has provided corroborating evidence of his absence on leave when the email reminder was sent on 11 June 2018 in the form of an automated out of office response. This gives 17 June 2018 as the date of the Appellant’s return to work. 20. The Respondent has provided the Tribunal with copies of the email sent on 11 June 2018, of the letter sent on 20 August 2018, and of the Notice of Intent and Penalty Notice. All correspondence was sent by post to the address given by the Appellant in the Notice of Appeal. 21. Conclusion 22. I have considered whether the Appellant has advanced a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the Regulations. I conclude that he has not. I note that the Appellant was on leave when the email reminder was sent but that he returned to work before the fee was due. I conclude that a reasonable data controller would have systems in place to comply with the Regulations. 23. I note the Appellant’s explanation of his involvement in stressful litigation which eventually concluded in January 2019. I also note that the fee was due some six months before the case settled, shortly after the Appellant returned from leave. I find that the Appellant has pointed to no specific difficulty or misfortune which explains his departure from the expected standards of a reasonable data controller at the time the fee was due. 24. I have considered whether there is any basis for departing from the Respondent’s policy as to the imposition of a £400 fixed penalty in the circumstances of this case. I find that there is not. 25. Having regard to the relevant principles, I note that the Appellant has stated that paying the litigation settlement figure of £120,000 has caused him ‘an enormous amount of financial difficulty.’ However, the Appellant has not presented any specific evidence of financial hardship which could affect the penalty. 526. In the circumstances I see no reason to depart from the Respondent’s assessment of the appropriate penalty. I am aware, however, that the Respondent will be able to take the Appellant’s financial circumstances into account when deciding how the penalty should be paid. 27. For all these reasons, the appeal is now dismissed, and the Penalty Notice is confirmed. JUDGE MOIRA MACMILLAN DATE: 29 APRIL 2020 DATE PROMULGATED: 6 MAY 2020 6"

Eur Ing1 Chris Gore (the Appellant) indicated on 14 May 2010 that he would like a complete set of documentation relating to a complaint he had made to the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) about Cornwall Council. The request for information 2. This request was formalised on 28 June 2010 when he confirmed he was seeking ""…. The 'complete set' of paperwork, that is all the paperwork, that the LGO used to come to the 'The final Decision' given in the letter of 14 April 2010."" 3. On 2 July 2010 the LGO responded to the Appellant. It clarified that the request was for the contents of the Appellant's complaints file. It explained that some of the information was exempt on the basis of s.44 of the FOIA and some on the basis of Regulation 12 (5) (d) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) by virtue of s. 32 (2) of the Local Government Act 1974. 4. After some correspondence on 14 September 2010 the LGO told the Appellant it had completed an internal review. It disclosed some of the withheld information to the Appellant but upheld the application of s.44 FOIA and Regulation 12 (5) (d) to the remainder 5. The disputed information relates to Notes to the Ombudsman On 14 May 2010 and a Draft letter dated 1 April 2010. 1 A professional engineering qualification. -4-EA/2011/0254; Decision The complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. The Information Commissioner found that the information in both of the documents containing the requested information fell within the meaning of environmental information under Regulation 2 (1) EIR. He did this on the basis that the nature of the information would inform the public about the matter under consideration and would therefore facilitate effective participation by the public in environmental decision making. 7. He found that the disputed information broadly related to a complaint made by the Appellant to the LGO about Cornwall Council’s decision not to take action to stop developments on a number of sites which the Appellant felt breach planning regulations. He found that the disputed information related to an activity and measure likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in Regulations 2 (1) (a) and (b) and was environmental information. 8. The IC considered the public interest arguments in relation to the requested information. The LGO had acknowledged that disclosure could contribute to public understanding of its decision-making process and that there was a general public interest in accountability and transparency. 9. However, the LGO argued that the statutory restriction from disclosing information obtained as part of – or in the course of – its investigations was vital in encouraging frankness and openness on the part of those providing information to it. The LGO believed that disclosure would go against the reasonable expectation of confidentiality on the part of those providing information in the course of its investigations. It stressed that an environment which discouraged the provision of information to it for fear of disclosure would have an adverse effect on its ability effectively to discharge its functions. 10. The IC accepted that was a valid public interest argument in favour of maintaining the exception. Although the LGO could resort to exercising its -5-EA/2011/0254; Decision statutory powers to compel third parties to provide it with information, that would not be a good use of public funds and resources in the context of voluntary cooperation and supply of information. The appeal to the Tribunal 11. Eur Ing Gore, in his representations to the Tribunal dated 29 November 2011, focused on two points on the basis that the LGO had admitted that disclosure of the two documents in question ""would contribute to the public understanding of its decision-making process"" and ""enhance the accountability and transparency of its investigation process"". 12. His first point was that, based on the IC's description of the two documents being withheld, the information contained within them should already have been disclosed within documents already released in the case. The information could not be classified as confidential if it had already been released. 13. His second point was that if there was information in those two documents which had not been released then, based on the LGO’s assertions, ""disclosure would contribute to a better understanding"" that information would allow him (the general public) to have a better understanding of the LGO's reasoning which led him to (what he characterises as) ""the perverse decision not to uphold my complaint against Cornwall Council, based on the grounds that I was 'too far away to suffer injustice', a reference to the fact that the two properties about which he was enquiring abutted his properties boundary, one directly and the other across a country public footpath. 14. In his view there was no justifiable reason why those documents should not be released to him. -6-EA/2011/0254; Decision Evidence 15. The Tribunal had the benefit of seeing the withheld information on a closed and confidential basis and has been able to satisfy itself about the particular nature of the information in question. 16. It has also considered the written witness statement of Neville Jones, a Deputy Ombudsman reporting to one of the two Local Government Ombudsmen currently in post, 9 February 2012. Conclusion and remedy 17. The Tribunal notes that under Part 3 of the Local Government Act 1974, Local Commissioners – more commonly known as Local Government Ombudsmen – may investigate complaints alleging maladministration and in deciding whether or not to investigate a complaint to act in their own discretion. 18. There are wide powers such Ombudsmen possess in terms of requiring the attendance and examination of witnesses and in respect of furnishing information and producing documents under the provisions of the Act. Failure to comply with the requirement of a Local Government Ombudsman in respect of s. 29 may lead to a fine or imprisonment for contempt of court. 19. There is a statutory restriction in s. 32 (2) of the 1974 Act on the disclosure of information obtained by a Local Government Ombudsman or any person discharging or assisting in the discharge of a function of a Local Government Ombudsman. That exists in part to protect people who are under a legal compulsion to provide a Local Government Ombudsman with information against the possible consequences of disclosure of that information. -7-EA/2011/0254; Decision 20. The Tribunal is satisfied that the statutory restriction on the disclosure of information in s.32 (2) of the 1974 Act applies regardless of the relevance of the information obtained and regardless of whether it is influential in a Local Government Ombudsman's consideration of any complaint. It is clearly sufficient that the information was obtained ""in the course of or for the purposes of an investigation"" under Part 3 of the 1974 Act. 21. Because of the confidential nature of every investigation conducted under this process, the wide powers of compulsion given to the LGO and the statutory restrictions provide a statutory framework constituting the context in which requests for the disclosure of information under EIR falls to be considered. 22. The Tribunal agrees that it is clear the parties submitting information to the LGO only do so on the basis that they expect such information to be held in absolute confidence, particularly because of the statutory prohibition that exists. Investigation reports published by the LGO are anonymised with place and party names being replaced with aliases and initials. To disclose such information would breach the basis of confidentiality and has the potential to cause complainant and witnesses to withhold information or curtail evidence to protect them from exposure in any future requests that may be made under EIR. 23. The Tribunal also accepts that it is possible that the knowledge that such disclosures might be made could prevent or dissuade members of the public from making a complaint in the first instance, diminishing a strong element of accountability and scrutiny which currently exists. 24. The Tribunal has seen the disputed information and agrees that it contains all the necessary elements requiring the protection of confidentiality in the circumstances claimed above. To release this information would be to discourage others to use the confidential process which is currently in place. -8-EA/2011/0254; Decision 25. The Tribunal has conducted the balancing test required to be considered and performed in relation to Regulation 12 (1) (b) and – in particular – the wider public interest in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in s. 32 (2) (3) of the 1974 Act. That public interest would be undermined if the documents requested in this case were disclosed to the Appellant. 26. The Tribunal has no difficulty in deciding unanimously – on the balance of probabilities – that the public interest in maintaining the exception significantly outweighs the public interest in any disclosure of the disputed information. 27. There is no order as to costs. [Signed on original] Robin Callender Smith Judge 23 March 2012 -9-"
"23","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0286 Heard at Riverside House, Edinburgh On 3 February 2020 Representation: Appellant: In person First Respondent: Before JUDGE BUCKLEY DAVE SIVERS PAUL TAYLOR Between ALEX CONWAY Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the appeal is allowed. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: UK Research and Innovation Complainant: Alex Conway 1The Substitute Decision 1. For the reasons set out below the Public Authority was not entitled to refuse the Complainant’s requests for information made on 27 July 2018 on the grounds that the request was vexatious under s 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Action Required 2. The Public Authority has already responded to the request in its response to the internal review. The Public Authority is not required to take any steps. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS508077193 of 15 July 2018 which held that UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) were entitled to rely on s 14(1) of FOIA. The Commissioner did not require the public authority to take any steps. Evidence and submissions 2. We have read and were referred to a bundle of documents. We heard oral submissions from Mr Conway and read written submissions from both parties. Mr Conway was permitted by the tribunal to produce further documents during the hearing. Copies of these were sent to the Commissioner and she was given the opportunity to comment. Factual background to the appeal 3. UKRI is the statutory body responsible for distributing UK research funding. It was established in April 2018 as a new non-Departmental Public Body bringing together the UK research councils, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), Innovate UK and Research England. Mr Conway is the CEO of Mental Illness Research in Children and Young Lives (‘Miricyl’). Miricyl campaigns for children and young people affected by mental illness and funds research into mental illness. 4. The background to this particular request is set out at p 102 of the bundle in a letter from Mr Conway to the Commissioner. He states that the request asked substantive questions about UKRI: • When it is widely understood MRC has not previously increased funding for mental health because of the lack of quality grant applications the FOI questions what research MRC has conducted as to the effect of its plans to substantially increase funding for mental health 2in the future (1 and 9). The question is why had it not been funding at a higher level before? • MRC prioritised one particular illness, which effects a much lower proportion of people than some other illnesses, for funding without considering any other ones which are less funded and more prevalent (questions 2, 3, 5, 7). This is very poor management of resources. • Why MRC does not use a globally recognised measure of the level of disability caused by the illness as a measure for allocating funding to different illnesses (6). MRC allocates funding to mental illness at a level of half the impact of mental health on the population. 5. Mr Conway has a disability which he told us causes him, amongst other things, to be more affected by stress than most people and sometimes to suffer from muddled thoughts and impaired memory. He states that this makes him more likely to inadvertently request information that he has already requested. UKRI were aware of his condition at the time of the internal review, and he had asked them to take it into account when determining whether overlapping requests were an indicator of vexatiousness. They stated that they took this into account when deciding to respond to the request at internal review stage, albeit that they upheld their initial decision to treat the request as vexatious. Requests, Decision Notice and appeal The Request 6. This appeal concerns the following request made by email on 27 July 2018: 1. Looking at the recent grants you have announced, if you were to maintain your core level of funding of mental health at c.£25m, I would estimate that you intend to spend an additional £15m on mental health research in 2018/2019. Given your track record and capacity in the sector how will you do this and maintain the quality you desire? Or will your core funding likely reduce? 2. With respect to this grant, Child and young adult mental health – the underpinning aetiology of self-harm and eating disorders, please explain why you are targeting these two areas, including any discussion, board or research papers comparing these illnesses with your other options 3. This should answer the questions: What other illnesses did you consider? And why did you reject them? Specifically why did you not choose to target: anxiety: addiction or shizoaffective disorder 4. Please list all the other grants into specific mental illnesses that you have funded in this proactive way (ie not response mode) over the last 5 years. 5. What % funding from 2 do you estimate the MRC will fund? 6. Why do you not allocate funding in line with the WHO burden of disease? Both at “family illness” level. ie malignant neoplasms, mental health and behavioural disorders etc and illness level: lung cancer, breast cancer, depression etc 37. List the projects the MRC has funded specifically into shizo affective disorder, with the value, title, duration, amount and abstract 2013-2018. 8. I think I am right in saying that you get an annual budget from The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy or maybe even direct from parliament but that you don’t know your funding any further than a year in advance. Is this correct? 9. If you were a company you would have cost centres with budgets and you would monitor spending against the budget on a monthly basis. How do you manage your spending? What are you equivalent of costs centres and what are their budgets for this year? The Council’s reply 7. UKRI replied by letter dated 23 August 2018, sent by email to Mr Conway on 24 August 2018, stating that it was treating the request as vexatious. UKRI said that they have already provided Mr Conway with information relating to MRC research funding and that they have responded to similar questions on a number of occasions. 8. Mr Conway requested an internal review on 24 August 2018. He complained about the individual who drafted the response. He also provided a commentary to the original request and made three additional requests. 9. On 28 August 2018 Mr Conway submitted a revised request, stating that his request for a review in relation to the original request and his complaint about the individual who wrote the response remained. On 29 August he made a further minor clarification. 10. UKRI responded to the internal review on 19 October 2018. The review upheld the original decision to treat the request as vexatious but answered the request in any event. The reasoning was as follows: …we have found that Section 14(1) of the Freedom of Information Act (vexatious request) was appropriately applied. As outlined previously this is because responses to similar questions, relating to MRC and other UKRI council research funding, had been provided already. In your request for an Internal Review you also requested some information which was similar to previous requests. However, in your request for an Internal Review you submitted a document “Analysis 27072018 and response”, where you provided a commentary on the original request and asked for further information. This document was useful in helping us identify where previous responses could have been clearer and where publicly available information on research council websites may not have been easy to locate. Therefore, we have provided a response to the questions you outlined in the Annexes attached to this letter…we have also provided our responses to the three additional FOI requests within Annex 1, so that the information is easily accessible to you. 411. The responses to each part of the request at issue in the appeal given in the response to the internal review were: Part 1: not held Part 2: The 2017/2018 MRC/Medical Research Foundation Call for Proposals on Child and young adult mental health builds on an earlier initiative. MRC participation in the earlier initiative was considered by the MRC Neuroscience and Mental Health Board in March 2016. An extract from the Board papers and minutes relating to this discussion are attached at Annex2 -R – MRC-MRF Child and adolescent health call 2016. Part 3: Information on the Board’s consideration of the Call for Proposals is provided at 2 above. Part 4: This information is publicly available. [links provided] Part 5: The Call for Proposals on Child and young adult mental health is a joint in initiative between the MRC and the Medical Research Foundation. Up to £2.5 million is available to support high quality pilot studies and research grants submitted to this call. The Medical Research Foundation is the majority funder and MRC will contribute approximately 40 per cent to the common funding pot. The final amount of funding committed jointly by MRC and the Foundation is dependent on the scientific excellence and quality of applications received. As reported on the Call web page the Panel meeting where proposal will be considered is on 27 November: Https://mrc.ukri.org/funding/browse/mrc-mrf/the-aetiology-of-self-harm- and-eating-disorders/ Part 6: Not held. Part 7: Not held. Part 8: Withdrawn therefore no response required. Part 9: Information provided in Annex 3 – MRC finance information with introduction. 12. In summary, UKRI provided answers to each individual part of the request either providing information or stating that it could not be provided because it was not held. The Decision Notice 513. In a decision notice dated 15 July 2019 the Commissioner decided that the Council had correctly applied s 14(1) FOIA (vexatious request). 14. The Commissioner found that the series of 14 requests submitted to UKRI up to 28 July 2018 are often multi-part and sometimes overlapping. They are on similar matters. UKRI’s response to one request often generates another request, further questions and requests for opinions. The Commissioner concluded that if this request was fully complied with, Mr Conway is likely to submit a further request on the same or similar subject. 15. UKRI has already provided Mr Conway with a significant amount of information in response to previous requests. There is no reason to doubt UKRI’s assertion that it has spent over 350 hours dealing with previous requests, given the volume and nature of the requests which are often multi-part, complex and require the input of various teams. Mr Conway has not put forward a wider compelling public interest. 16. On this basis the Commissioner concluded that complying with the request would be a continuation of what has been a significant burden to UKRI and that the burden is disproportionate to the request’s value. 17. The Commissioner found that there was no breach of s 16 because there is no duty to offer advice and assistance if a request is vexatious. Notice of Appeal 18. Mr Conway attached a number of documents to his grounds of appeal, but it appears that his main arguments are that: 1. The decision notice is biased and incompetent. 2. The Commissioner ignored Mr Conway’s complaints that showed a pattern of behaviour by UKRI. 3. The Commissioner gave no reasons for not answering his complaints. 4. In a document attached to the decision notice the Commissioner asked Mr Conway to make the complaints again. This is abusive and incompetent and biases the decision. 5. The Commissioner ignored the FOI Code of Practice and the UKRI complaints procedure. 6. The Commissioner has been dishonest. 7. The Commissioner was wrong to decide that the request was not in the public interest. Mr Conway’s FOI requests have created the largest research related Equality Impact Assessment ever seen in the UK. 8. The Commissioner accepted without question UKRI’s assertion that Mr Conway’s FOI requests took 370 hours to respond to, which means that each request took more than 26 hours. 9. The Commissioner did not analyse the request to see which questions might have been vexatious. 610. The Commissioner decided that Mr Conway’s previous requests were overlapping without seeing those requests. 19. Mr Conway provides further detail of his criticisms of the decision notice in a table attached to the notice of appeal. From this document we have extracted the following challenges to the decision: 11. Not all 9 parts are requests for information under the FOIA. Parts 1, 6 and 9 are general enquiries or requests for an opinion. The Commissioner should not have included them. 12. It is incorrect to state that he subsequently sent three further requests. He only sent one further request. 13. The Commissioner did not include in the decision notice the conduct of UKRI when dealing with the request. 14. The meeting with the MRC was only provided after seven months and a complaint to the Commissioner. 15. The Commissioner did not mention in the decision notice the further complaints made by Mr Conway to the Commissioner between 4 December 2018 and 25 April 2019 and Mr Conway was asked to resubmit these complaints. 16. The Commissioner failed to review the internal review. 17. The UKRI complaints procedure states that a complaint about the internal review should be made to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman p 24 of bundle. 18. Mr Conway refers to the Commissioner’s guidance on dealing with vexatious requests at para 36 and 37. The panel assumes that he asserts that the Commissioner did not follow this part of its guidance. 19. If previous requests to all of the separate legal entities are to be taken into account, then the number of separate entities should be taken into account as context: the Commissioner claims 14 requests across what were previously 9 organisations. 20. Making on average 1 request per month is not excessive. 21. The Commissioner did not have due regard to the need to make reasonable adjustments for Mr Conway’s disability. The ICO’s response 20. The Commissioner submits that UKRI’s matrix setting out its communications with Mr Conway is credible. On the basis of this matrix the Commissioner summarises these communications at paras 10-29 identifying 11 requests for information. This summary will not be repeated here but we have taken it into account. 21. The Commissioner took a common sense and holistic approach. The request was unreasonable looked at in the round, taking account of prior correspondence that lasted over a year, involved at least eleven requests and numerous other 7emails and letters. Many of the earlier requests were repetitive, overlapping and highly complex and frequently sought commentary and opinion. 22. The requests placed a significant burden on UKRI’s resources and there was little public interest to outweigh that burden. Mr Conway was free to make his central claim of underfunding with the information he already had. It was a misuse of the FOI regime to keep hounding the MRC and UKRI for ever more detailed spending breakdowns, policy justifications and analysis that he ought to be doing himself. Any public interest did not outweigh the fact that the request was vexatious viewed in context and against the prior correspondence. 23. The Commissioner was entitled to take account of Mr Conway’s behaviour which occurred after UKRI had refused to comply with the request in line with the holistic approach in Dransfield. 24. The Commissioner was entitled to take account of UKRI’s efforts to comply with the letter and spirit of the FOIA in its dealings with Mr Conway. 25. In summary, the history of the requests showed them to be vexatious; they were disproportionate and sought to use the FOIA as a means to carry on a policy disagreement with UKRI; Mr Conway eventually began to display open hostility to UKRI staff members; Mr Conway’s use of the FOIA procedure was, in all the circumstances, unjustified and inappropriate. 26. The Commissioner then deals briefly with each of Mr Conway’s complaints referred to above as his ‘main arguments’. Issues 27. The issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether or not the request is vexatious. Any matters raised by Mr Conway which do not relate to this issue are not within our remit, and we have not made findings on those issues. Legal framework S 14(1) Vexatious Request 28. Guidance on applying s 14 is given in the decisions of the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in Dransfield ([2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and [2015] EWCA Civ 454). The tribunal has adapted the following summary of the principles in Dransfield from the judgment of the Upper Tribunal in CP v Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 427 (AAC): 29. The Upper Tribunal held that the purpose of section 14 must be to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA (para 10). That formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal 8subject to the qualification that this was an aim which could only be realised if ‘the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied’ (para 72 of the CA judgment). 30. The test under section 14 is whether the request is vexatious not whether the requester is vexatious (para 19). The term ‘vexatious’ in section 14 should carry its ordinary, natural meaning within the particular statutory context of FOIA (para 24). As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may be vexatious but that is not a rule. Annoying or irritating requests are not necessarily vexatious given that one of the main purposes of FOIA is to provide citizens with a qualified right of access to official documentation and thereby a means of holding public authorities to account (para 25). The IC’s guidance that the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause was a useful starting point as long as the emphasis was on the issue of justification (or not). An important part of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of whether or not there is an adequate or proper justification for the request (para 26). 31. Four broad issues or themes were identified by the Upper Tribunal as of relevance when deciding whether a request is vexatious. These were: (a) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (b) the motive (of the requester); (c) the value or serious purpose (of the request); and (d) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). These considerations are not exhaustive and are not intended to create a formulaic check-list. 32. Guidance about the motive of the requester, the value or purpose of the request and harassment of or distress to staff is set out in paragraphs 34-39 of the Upper Tribunal’s decision. 33. As to burden, the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether the request is properly to be described as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor [para 29]. Thus, the greater the number of previous FOIA requests that the individual has made to the public authority concerned, the more likely it may be that a further request may properly be found to be vexatious. A requester who consistently submits multiple FOIA requests or associated correspondence within days of each other or who relentlessly bombards the public authority with email traffic is more likely to be found to have made a vexatious request [para 32]. 34. Ultimately the question was whether a request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Answering that question required a broad, holistic approach which emphasised the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there was a previous 9course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests [paras 43 and 45]. 35. In the Court of Appeal in Dransfield Arden LJ gave some additional guidance in paragraph 68: ‘In my judgment the Upper Tribunal was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the request was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available...’ 36. Nothing in the above paragraph is inconsistent with the Upper Tribunal’s decision which similarly emphasised (a) the need to ensure a holistic approach was taken and (b) that the value of the request was an important but not the only factor. 37. The lack of a reasonable foundation to a request was only the starting point to an analysis which must consider all the relevant circumstances. Public interest cannot act as a ‘trump card’. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious. The role of the tribunal 38. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. 10Submissions Summary of the Appellant’s oral submissions 39. Mr Conway submitted that his request could not be described as a request with no reasonable foundation and that it was not vexatious taking account of the factors of burden, motive, serious purpose and harassment. 40. Mr Conway set out the other relevant work undertaken by Miricyl as context to the request. Miricyl’s campaign is centred on the apparent difference between the disease burden of mental health according to the World Health Organisation and the percentage of funding allocated to mental health research. 41. The other main strand of Miricyl’s work focusses on the equality impact of UKRI’s research funding policies because of a concern that these policies have a disparate impact on mental health researchers. Miricyl has highlighted the fact that public bodies that allocate funding are obliged to carry out an Equality Impact Assessment (‘EIA’) of research funding policies in accordance with the public sector equality duty. As a result of Miricyl raising this issue, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has become involved in ensuring that these bodies comply with the PSED. It is at least partly because of Miricyl’s work that Health and Care Research Wales and the Scottish Government’s Chief Scientist Office will be carrying out EIAs of their new strategies. UKRI also confirmed in May 2019 that Research England would be producing an EIA in connection with its general duties. 42. Miricyl has submitted evidence to two commons select committees on this issue and Mr Conway tells us that the select committee is considering a committee on equalities in research funding. Mr Conway has asked 11 questions in parliament and spoken to a number of MPs on this issue. As part of its campaign Miricyl has instructed Leigh Day and David Wolf QC in a proposed judicial review action and has has issued pre-action judicial review letters to UKRI in relation to its alleged failure to comply with the public sector equality duty. 43. Mr Conway also explained the reason behind the different parts of the request. Part 1 44. This is not a request for information – it is a general enquiry or a request for an opinion. UKRI had said previously that there was not enough capacity, i.e. not enough academics, in mental health. When they announced an additional 15 million pounds worth of funding, Mr Conway thought it was important to know how UKRI thought this would work. Part 2 and 3 1145. Mr Conway thought it was important to understand the reasoning and/or critical analysis behind the decision to fund research on self-harm and eating disorders rather than, for example, on anxiety and addiction, which is the least funded. Part 4 46. Mr Conway accepts that this is available on the website but says that it is ‘impossible to find’. He had not been able to locate it on the website before he made his request. Part 5 47. The funding for the grant for self-harm and eating disorders was going to be partly funded by the MRC. Part 6 48. This is a general enquiry in line with Miricyl’s central argument that funding should be allocated in line with the burden of disease. Part 7 49. UKRI had already provided Mr Conway with 2011-2016 figures. This was a request for an update. The overlap is a mistake – it should have been limited to 2017 and 2018. Part 8 50. This was withdrawn. Part 9 51. Mr Conway thought that the budgetary decisions might hold the key to the disparity in funding. This was intended to cast light on that. 52. Mr Conway spent some time addressing us on the conduct of UKRI and the Commissioner after the request and internal review. For the reasons set out in our discussion and conclusions below, this is not relevant to the question of whether or not the request was vexatious and so we do not summarise this part of the submissions here. UKRI’s position 53. UKRI were not a party to the appeal and did not provide any written submissions. Their position is set out in correspondence to the Commissioner. 12In a letter to the Commissioner dated 24 May 2019 UKRI state that the request was: initially refused as a vexatious request. This was on the basis that much of the information requested had been addressed in response to previous FOI requests and correspondence and the remainder of the request largely involved questions or requests for opinions… In considering the Internal Review we took account of the commentary and found it helpful in identifying areas in previous FOI responses and correspondence that could have been more clear. In responding to the Internal Review the initial decision, that the request was vexatious was upheld, however we did also provide a response to all nine of the original questions and the three new requests. In the response we tried to be clear where there was any relevant recorded information, we provided links to publicly available information which had been identified previously and copies of information where relevant. In cases where there was no relevant information this was confirmed. We also provided a response to the questions asked, including those identified by Mr Conway as asking for an opinion. As you will see from the letter we were also offered a meeting with the MRC’s head of Neuroscience and this was taken up by Mr Conway. 54. UKRI provided further detail in support of its conclusion that the request was vexatious to the Commissioner in a letter dated 4 July 2019 (at page 177 of the bundle). In summary its position is as follows. The request references questions that had been addressed previously and information that had been provided in response to previous requests. UKRI provided a summary of all requests from Mr Conway. This request was the tenth from Mr Conway to UKRI and its predecessor councils, nine of which related directly to health and mental health research. Since July 2018 Mr Conway has submitted a further eleven requests to UKRI, of which eight related directly to health and mental health research. 55. In many cases the requests involved multiple information requests, questions about strategy, budgets and decision making processes. They have sought information on health and mental health research for MRC and across UKRI. The requests have been broad and have involved requests for recorded information and extensive and repeated questions about MRC strategy and approaches to funding mental health research. 56. The questions posed have evolved over time but the information and general responses requested all relate broadly to the the same information regarding: • How the MRC funds research, including the specifics of decision-making processes • How the MRC funds mental health research, including the specifics of decision-making processes for mental health proposals. • Information relating to the distribution of the MRC’s research funding across all areas of research supported. • Information relating to MRC and UKRI budget plans and spending for mental health research. 13• Information on the MRC’s strategy for Lifelong Mental Health, published in April 2017 and covering the period 2017-2022. • Specific information relating to the MRC’s mental health research portfolio and asking for a substantial amount of additional analysis work to be done. • Information relating to health and mental health research by other UKRI councils. 57. Clarification has been required in a number of cases. Refinement and prioritisation have been necessary to take account of the appropriate limit because of the level of detail requested or additional analysis or new analysis requested. Requests have also asked for comments on recommendations or analyses undertaken by Mr Conway. 58. Responses provided were often followed by further multiple questions and queries. Sometimes discussions led to clarification that previous responses and information was relevant, and sometimes additional information was required. Mr Conway also contacted research council staff directly on similar issues. Several aspects of the different requests were duplicative or overlapping, and required significant coordination across UKRI. 59. In relation to the request in issue, UKRI stated that parts 1 and 3 concerned information that was not held, part 2 sought background information on a funding call, the majority of the information requested in parts 4, 5, 7 and 8 was publicly available and parts 6 and 9 asked for an opinion. 60. UKRI stated that as many of the questions addressed similar issues to previous requests/correspondence the request was assessed and found to be vexatious under s 14(1). UKRI concluded that the request has the potential to cause a disproportionate level of disruption because of the relationship with previous requests/correspondence and the likely burden it would place on the organisation. 61. The request for an internal review followed a similar pattern to previous correspondence in making further requests. The pattern of overlapping and duplicate requests was repeated. The language used by the Appellant was increasingly critical, distressing and began to be directed at individuals. 62. The letter then addresses the issues of burden, frequent or overlapping requests and unreasonable persistence. Burden 63. The request followed a similar pattern to previous requests with multiple questions addressing similar issues. Therefore UKRI took a view on the significant effort involved in responding to similar questions in the past. UKRI 14also considered the impact of any subsequent repeated, related and overlapping requests any response might generate. UKRI also took account of the significant staff time (370 hours) that had been taken up in responding to previous requests. Mr Conway would be aware of the burden because he had been advised that consultation across different groups had been necessary due to the breadth of the requests. Mr Conway had made a number of requests seeking information on research spend by health area etc, where the analysis required to identify and extract the information would exceed the appropriate limit. Frequent or overlapping requests 64. A number of the requests addressed points that had been raised in previous requests and correspondence. The evolution of further questions and new FOIA requests which formed a feature of correspondence following previous requests was relevant. There were a number of occasions where multiple requests and questions were being taken forward at the same time. Unreasonable persistence 65. The requestor appeared to be attempting to reopen questions which had already been comprehensively addressed. Question 6 asked why the MRC did not use a particular method of budget allocation. Responses to questions on how the MRC funded research and allocated budgets had previously been provided on several occasions. The position at the time of the internal review 66. The internal review request helped to identify more clearly the information the requestor expected to see. It identified areas where the initial response could have been more explicit in identifying where in previous correspondence the issues had been addressed and how publicly available information might be used to address the questions. The requestor also disclosed that they had a diagnosed mental health condition and requested reasonable adjustments in particular where the requests were overlapping. Although the internal review upheld the original decision it aimed to provide as full a response as possible to try and draw the matter to a close. 67. The letter then summarises the responses provided in the internal review. It identifies a number of areas in which the initial response could have been done differently as follows: … Links to publicly available information that could be combined to address the question were provided. Information had been provided previously on calls for proposals (22/06/18) and funded research (21/09/18). We accept that the initial response to the request could have been more explicit on this point and could have provided the links 15to this information and views on how it might be combined with the MRC mental health research portfolio information. (Part 3) … In the internal review response an estimate of the percentage of funding available for each area under the Call was provided along with a link to where funding decisions would be confirmed as the Call progressed. We accept that the initial response could have been more clear on the interpretation of this part of the request. (Part 5) … The internal review response provided an explanation of how to review the MRC portfolio (provided previously) to extract the information now requested. A link was also provided to publicly available information that could be searched to find updated information. We accept that the initial response could have been more explicit on how to search the information provided previously/publicly available. (Part 7) 68. The internal assessment of the internal review also contains certain additional points relevant to UKRI’s position: 22. Elements of the internal review request show a similar pattern. 23. The new requests are overlapping because they request information on spend by illness which is essentially the same as the previous request FOI2008/0008. 24. There is some evidence of a scattergun approach with correspondence addressed to the FOI team, MRC’s evaluation team and a MRC Scientific Programme Manager. 25. The tone of some of the comments in the internal review application indicates an intransigent position. 26. The proposed response aims to address Mr Conway’s request for a reasonable adjustment to be applied where requests were overlapping, by fulfilling the duty to advise and assist the requestor. Discussion and conclusions 69. The tribunal considers the four factors identified by the Upper Tribunal in Dransfield to be a helpful framework to structure its consideration of whether the request was vexatious but has regard to the fact that it is not intended to be an exhaustive definition or a checklist for determination of this issue and that a holistic approach must be taken, with no one factor acting as a trump card. 70. In our view the date at which we should determine whether or not the request was vexatious is the date of the internal review. Although the case law states that a holistic approach should be taken and that we should take account of all the relevant circumstances, the matter should be considered in the light of the information available to the public authority at the time. As part of this, it is legitimate to take into account the likely future conduct by the requestor. 71. We are not aware of any case law which explicitly deal with this point. The authorities on vexatiousness refer to a prior or past course of dealings. None of them refer to matters that took place after the internal review. In our view, a similar approach to the timing of the assessment of the public interest should be 16taken. The first tier tribunal is assessing past compliance with FOIA, not monitoring ongoing compliance. We must consider how the public authority dealt with the request and then whether the Commissioner erred in law. Evidence of conduct post internal review can be taken account if it informs our decision as to the likely future conduct of Mr Conway at the date of the internal review. Burden 72. UKRI provided a response to the request at internal review stage, but there is no evidence on the amount of time it took to respond to this request or any other evidence as to its specific burden. In the absence of this evidence and taking a common sense approach in the light of the content of the response the tribunal takes the view that this request taken alone is not burdensome. 73. In accordance with the case law we take into account the context and history of the request and the previous course of dealings between Mr Conway and UKRI. UKRI assert that they have spent ‘around 370 hours’ dealing with the requests, but we have been provided with no explanation of how this 370 hours was calculated. Without any breakdown or explanation of how this figure was reached, we are not prepared to accept it. 74. We have been provided with a table headed ‘summary of requests’ which we accept summarises the correspondence and freedom of information requests received from Mr Conway. Looking at the summary of requests and correspondence received prior to the internal review, it is clear that UKRI and its predecessors have spent a significant amount of time dealing with requests and correspondence from Mr Conway. It is also clear that Mr Conway often follows a response with a request for clarification or additional information. Sometimes he asks for information that has already been provided. The requests are often broad and contain multiple parts. The correspondence or requests for information also regularly contain or are accompanied by requests for opinions or comments on Mr Conway’s analysis. 75. Although most of the requests are for different or more detailed/clarified information virtually all of them relate to the same broad areas. This is unsurprising because these are the areas primarily of interest to Miricyl i.e. the apparent difference between the disease burden and the percentage of funding allocated to mental health research and the equality impact of UKRI’s research funding policies. 76. The table shows that there has been, on occasion, a repeated request for the same information. Where there is any direct overlap we take into account that some of this is likely to have been caused by Mr Conway’s disability, a factor that was known to the public authority at the time of the internal review. 1777. Given the focus of Miricyl’s work we do not think that it is surprising, nor an indicator of vexatiousness that the requests and correspondence relate to the same broad areas. Further, although the level of correspondence and requests taken together is high, this is not a case where Mr Conway is relentlessly bombarding UKRI with email traffic. Much of the correspondence appears to be part of genuine and effective communication between UKRI and Mr Conway intended to assist Mr Conway in obtaining the information he requires. 78. Although in February 2018 Mr Conway did submit multiple requests within days of each other, in general the requests are months rather than days apart. 79. In the light of all these factors, we recognise that these requests and the related correspondence have placed a significant administrative burden on UKRI and we take that into account. We accept that the evidence suggests that there was likely to be further requests and correspondence from Mr Conway in the future. We have concluded that this burden is not disproportionate, taking a holistic approach and in the light of our conclusions below. Motive/value or serious purpose of the request 80. Given the background information provided by Mr Conway on the work carried out by Miricyl, it is clear to us that this is not a request which has no reasonable foundation. There is no evidence in this case to suggest that the request was made deliberately to annoy or out of vengeance for some action by the authority. We disagree with the Commissioner’s findings that there is no wider compelling public interest. 81. We find that the information sought would be of value to the requester, to the public in general and in particular to the section of the public directly or indirectly affected by mental health. There is a very high public interest in the question of the allocation of large amounts of public money to research in particular areas, and the impact of those funding decisions either in terms of the equality impact, or in terms of the impact on particular conditions. The information requested is valuable to inform the debate on that important issue. 82. Mr Conway has explained very clearly why the particular information requested is of importance to understanding how and why funding is allocated in a particular way. It is not the case that this information has already been provided (save for the mistaken overlap in dates in part 7), nor that the question of how funding is or should be allocated has already been comprehensively dealt with. It is clear from the response provided at internal review stage that valuable information was made available as a result of the request. 83. We note that some of the correspondence post-internal review suggests that Mr Conway may be beginning to focus more on complaints about the conduct of UKRI and the Commissioner, and less on the important issues with which 18Miricyl is concerned. If Mr Conway’s future requests continue to become distant from his starting point, he risks ‘vexatiousness by drift’ (see Wise v Information Commissioner (GIA/1871/2011; EA2010/0166). In our view he had not drifted from his starting point at the date of the internal review, nor, at that stage, was it likely that he would do so. Harassment/distress 84. We accept that the wording of the request for an internal review was critical and directed at an individual. It stated: ‘I would like to raise a complaint about the anonymous person who signed of the response to my request to their supervisor. Your response was ill judged, poorly conceived and vexatious’ 85. We do not accept that this can be classed as ‘harassment’. Although an individual might understandably feel unhappy about having a complaint made against them in these terms, we do not accept that a reasonable employee would suffer from anything that might be termed ‘distress’ in response to this complaint. 86. The request for an internal review also stated: ‘You can only deflect individual questions not stop me from making any further requests. I have taken advice from the ICO and I strongly recommend that you collaborate with me in my lines of enquiry.’ 87. Whilst this is strongly stated, in the panel’s view it does not necessarily indicate that Mr Conway has adopted an intransigent position. 88. We note that after the internal review Mr Conway’s language has become increasingly critical and his criticisms increasingly personal, both in relation to individuals at UKRI and at the Commissioner’s office. Mr Conway’s subsequent conduct does not lead us to decide that the public authority was correct to conclude at the time that the request was vexatious, but Mr Conway should note that using this type of language greatly increases the risk of future requests being correctly classified as vexatious. Summary of conclusions 89. We have taken a holistic and broad approach and have looked at the request in the light of the past course of dealings and Mr Conway’s likely future conduct. We have considered in particular the significant burden on UKRI, and the value and purpose of this request. We note that the public interest should not be seen as a ‘trump card’, but we have balanced the public interest against the resource implications of this request and its predecessors, in the light of the other relevant factors set out above. Looking at all these factors we find that the request was 19not vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of the FOIA.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. On 16 February 2015 the Appellant in these proceedings, Mr Mabbutt, asked the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service (WMFRS): ““Please can you supply me with a list of the locations of all the Fire Hydrants within your administrative area. Please could you also include canal access hatches, if you still maintain these. If so, please indicate which is which, or provide two separate files. I would like to know the exact location (longitude & latitude) if known, or if that is not held I would like the nearest street address.” 2. WMFRS resisted the request relying on the exemption in s24(1) FOIA, national security and s31(2) prejudice to law enforcement (it later relied on s38(1) endangerment of health and safety). Mr Mabbutt complained to the Respondent Information Commissioner (“ICO”) who following an investigation ordered the disclosure of the canal hatch information but upheld the reliance of WMFRS’s on s24(1) to withhold information about fire hydrants. The decision notice 3. The ICO concluded that the withholding of the information was reasonably necessary for national security and a listing of hydrants and their locations would assist in the planning of an attack by poisoning on water supply infrastructure by identifying access points (dn paragraph 11-13). Such an attack on the infrastructure would be in the domain of national security. While hydrants are visible a comprehensive list of the precise location of every hydrant would place in the public domain more information than is available through hydrants being visible. WMFS supplied a list of attacks and attempted attacks on water supplies (DN paragraph 15, document at 2Appeal No: EA/2015/0288 bundle pages 61-76, list at page 63). The ICO considered that such an attack was plausible. 4. In considering the balance of public interest (dn paragraphs 21-24) the ICO did not consider that there were any weighty factors in favour of disclosure, and recognised the inherent weight and significance of national security as a matter of fundamental public interest he therefore concluded that the location of the hydrants should not be disclosed. The Appeal 5. Mr Mabbett appealed against the decision. He argued that similar information had been released in the past, that high pressure water hydrants could not be used to inject poison into the water supply and that information was already in the public domain since hydrants were visible. 6. In resisting the appeal the ICO relied on the decision notice. He contended that even if similar material had been released for other locations this did not preclude the application of s24(1) in this case. He noted the current threat of terrorist attack and remained satisfied that the possibility of an attack via fire hydrants was plausible and that since a complete list of hydrants was not available the disclosure would add to the information in the public domain. Issues 7. The two issues for the tribunal to decide were first whether the information was exempt information in that exemption from the duty to disclose was required for the purposes of national security and secondly, if so, where did the balance of public interest lie between disclosure and non-disclosure. 8. Mr Mabbett doubted the credibility of the information provided to the ICO which included an article by an author which did not indicate the author’s credentials; although he acknowledged that the author had written a book on the subject. He considered that there was no evidence of a terrorist attack through a fire hydrant and that it amounted to “mere supposition and very little of that”. He felt that the request was very similar to a request he had made to the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, which had, having relied on s24, then consulted the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and reversed its position. No harm had come from the disclosure of this and similar information. He questioned the expertise of the 3Appeal No: EA/2015/0288 WMFRS and ICO in coming to a decision contrary to the expert body. He did not consider the finding with respect to national security reasonable. 9. He explained that he was part of an open information group – openstreetmap which could be described as a “Wikipedia of maps” producing a freely available map of the world maintained by volunteers. The information requested would be fed into the map. In addition to the principle of open information he identified a number of public benefits from disclosure of the information: it would enable the public to hold to account those responsible for the maintenance of the hydrants as well as enabling them to assist by reporting vandalism, it would assist those members of the public who prefer to buy houses near a fire hydrant and it would assist builders and others who need access to the water supply from hydrants when carrying out works. Consideration 10. The tribunal noted that while on Mr Mabbett’s account the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure had concluded that a similar request in a different area did not give rise to considerations of national security, WMFRS had consulted the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit which confirmed the view that WMFRS had taken of the national security implications (bundle page 77). Although this view may have differed from the view of the other agency, that related to a different area that might have a different susceptibility to terrorist attack; furthermore it is entirely proper for two different expert bodies in this complex and uncertain area to come to different conclusions. The tribunal, having reviewed the article “Securing Our Water Supply, Protecting a Vulnerable Resource”, were satisfied that it provided significant indications of potential threats to the water supply system and in the light of the views of the Counter Terrorism Unit and the information in the article it was reasonable to conclude that the information requested would be of assistance in carrying out an attack on the water supply infrastructure. The tribunal noted, in particular, that the article described, contrary to Mr Mabbett’s view, how contaminants could be introduced via a hydrant. The tribunal was satisfied that s24(1) was engaged by this request for information. 11. The tribunal was further satisfied that, while Mr Mabbett had identified public interests served by disclosure, the public interest in protecting national security in this case substantially outweighed the public interest in disclosure. 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0288 12. The tribunal was therefore satisfied that the decision of the ICO was correct in law and upheld that decision. The appeal is dismissed. 13. Our decision is unanimous.

"141","FOI","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2016/0081 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN RODERICK LUBBOCK Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD Second Respondent Heard at Field House in London: 28th September 2016 and at Fox Court in London: 20 December 2016. Date of Decision: 6th February 2017. Before Brian Kennedy QC Paul Taylor Anne Chafer DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the Decision Notice dated 3 March 2016 and dismisses the appeal:REASONS: Introduction: [1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice dated 3 March 2016 (reference FS50606866), which is a matter of public record. The Public Authority concerned is the University of Oxford (“ the University”). [2] The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat at Field House, London on 28th Sep- tember 2016 but the Tribunal were unable to conclude the hearing and issued Direc- tions on the 29th September 2016. The Tribunal reconvened at Fox Court, London on 20 December 2016. Factual Background to this Appeal: [3] Full details of the background to this appeal, Mr. Lubbock’s request for informa- tion and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice and not re- peated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns the question of whether Mr. Lubbock’s request was vexatious. History and Chronology: [4] 4 Sept 2015 Request for all university communications referencing ice hockey 2 Oct 2015 University refuses request, citing s14 (1) 2 Oct 2015 Request for internal review 15 Dec 2015 Request again refused 12 Jan 2016 Complaint to the CommissionerRelevant Law: [5] Section 14 Vexatious or repeated requests (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for in- formation if the request is vexatious. (2) Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for informa- tion which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subse- quent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a rea- sonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request. Commissioner’s Decision Notice: [6] The University explained that there has been a private dispute between the Ox- ford University Sports Federation (the department of the University that oversees student sports clubs) (“OUSF”) and the Oxford Ice Hockey Trust (a team and club that is independent to the University)(“the Trust”). The requested information relates broadly to that dispute. [7] The University stated that it had attempted to resolve this dispute in various ways. However, since March 2013 it had received 15 FoIA requests from various in- dividuals known to be associated with the Trust. Ten were complied with, and five were refused on the grounds of vexatiousness. Evidence was received by the Com- missioner showing the scale of the effort required to comply with these requests (es- timating approximately sixty hours and requiring consultation with twenty-three indi- viduals), as well as the unreasonable persistence and at times openly hostile attitude of requesters. [8] Regarding the subject matter of the requests themselves, the University states that backdrop of the requests is a private dispute between the University and former athletes that is of no interest to the wider public. It characterised the totality of therequests as a “scatter gun” attempt to open up a “second front” of the dispute. The Commissioner accepted this argument, noting that even if the request were complied with, the dispute would continue. Therefore, whilst considering the Appellant’s re- quest not to be vexatious per se, it forms part of a series of requests that are in their entirety vexatious. Grounds of Appeal: [9] Mr. Lubbock put forward three grounds of appeal: i) Inaccurate Characterisation of the Background to the Request The instant request was made on behalf of the Trust, which has no dispute with the OUSF; rather, it has lodged a formal complaint with the University al- leging serious misconduct on the part of University staff including, inter alia, covert audio recordings of students, intentional disruption of sporting activi- ties, threatening students with academic repercussions, deceit and defama- tion. The Appellant argues that any references to this misconduct as a ‘dis- pute’ trivialise and misrepresent the misconduct and attempts to conceal it. Such misconduct by University staff that has been allowed to continue and has been ‘covered up’ by the institution is a matter of public interest. ii) Previous Requests by the Trust Contrary to the Decision Notice, the Trust has only made three previous FOIA requests. There is at least one FOIA request that was made by an individual unknown to the Trust, and no evidence has been provided that the remaining requests came from individuals associated with the Trust and not from jour- nalists or interested third parties. iii) Insufficient attempts to address the Trust’s concerns Following one meeting with senior University staff in October 2013, the Appel- lant alleges that the Trust was threatened with legal action and attempts were made to prevent the team competing in the British University league. A further meeting in January 2015 was also adjudged by the Appellant to be an attempt to conceal misconduct.The Commissioner’s Response: [10] i) Inaccurate Characterisation of the Background to the Request The Commissioner’s understanding is that the Oxford Blues team was formed from former members of the official University Ice Hockey Club (‘OUIHC’) as the result of an ongoing dispute over the organisation’s structure and the branding of merchandise. This and the allegations of misconduct are beyond the remit of this appeal, but the Commissioner now accepts that identifying and addressing such misconduct is in the public interest. Nevertheless, the extremely broad nature of the request in both subject matter and time period, with no direct link to the misconduct allegations, has lead the Commissioner to repeat his contention that the request is a fishing expedition likely to lead to further correspondence without providing any resolution to the disputes. ii) Previous Requests The Commissioner cannot determine whether the disputed twelve requests were associated with the trust, and as such the Commissioner requests that the University be joined to the appeal. However, the three previous requests made on behalf of the Trust are extremely broad in scope (albeit admittedly narrower than the instant request) and there exists a degree of overlap with the present request. The burden of complying, the disruption to and negative impact on staff members and the irritation of the requests is sufficient to meet the ‘high standard’ of vexatiousness described in Dransfield. iii) Insufficient Attempts to resolve the concerns The University’s attempts at resolving the dispute is out-with the remit of this appeal, and is not critical to the question of vexatiousness. Nevertheless, hav- ing reviewed the University’s evidence, the Commissioner is satisfied that there have been attempts made at a resolution.[11] In view of new evidence presented by the Appellant, which was not before the Information Commissioner at the time of his investigation, the Tribunal issued Direc- tions dated 29th September 2016, joining the University and requesting submissions from all parties as follows: i) The University to provide evidence as to the precise nature of the burden in complying, how it determined the previous requests to have come from the Trust, precisely what correspondence it considers to be ‘hostile’ and any fur- ther submissions regarding the involvement of particular staff members in the dispute. ii) The Appellant regarding his claims about certain meetings with the Univer- sity and if his complaint had been finalised. iii) The First Respondent as to whether the Appellant’s subject access request was a relevant consideration in relation to whether his request was vexatious and the independence of the University officer carrying out the internal re- view. The Directions required submissions within 28 days from all Parties with a further 14 days for submissions in response. THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD SUBMISSIONS [12] On 24th November 2016 the University replied. [13] Ms. Potts provided a witness statement. She is the Academic Registrar for the University, with responsibility for the co-ordination and development of student- related services and operations; in this case, she is charged with rebuilding relations between the University and the ice hockey community, and supporting members of OUIHC. She gave evidence that subsequent to the present appeal being lodged, the Appellant raised a formal complaint of harassment to the Vice Chancellor.Background to the Dispute: [14] Regarding the genesis of the dispute, it arose when certain members of the Men’s Ice Hockey Team within OUIHC objected to the Women’s team using OUIHC branding on their merchandise, being of the opinion that they should use the Oxford University Women’s Ice Hockey Club branding. OUIHC approached OUSF to at- tempt to resolve the dispute. OUSF ruled that the women’s team should be given the opportunity to use the OUIHC branding, but made certain criticisms of the layout of the website which did not adequately highlight the distinctions between the teams. [15] In protest, fifteen members of the men’s team resigned, one of which being the Appellant. They requested they be permitted to continue to play under the name ‘Oxford University Ice Hockey Club’. Mr. Roycroft, the University’s Director of Sport, began a series of discussions with a view to encouraging the dissenting players to rejoin OUIHC. This was unsuccessful, and the players formed their own team under the auspices of the Trust. The disagreement has now stretched beyond branding, and the dispute is which team is the proper successor to the historical Men’s Blues team and has the right to name its fixture against the University of Cambridge the ‘Varsity Match’. The University is only concerned that an independent group does not present itself as an official University team. [16] Ms. Potts accepted that, during a meeting in April 2013, Mr. Roycroft attempted to make an audio recording without the permission of the participants. This recording was discovered in the course of the meeting, immediately deleted and Mr. Roycroft apologised for his error of judgment. However, between 26 March 2013 and 4 Sep- tember 2015, the University received fifteen FOIA requests pertaining to this dispute. Mr. Damien Fessey, honorary trustee of the Trust at the time, made three of the re- quests and voluminous disclosure was made between June 2013 and March 2014. Ms. Potts noted that no complaints were forthcoming from the Trust from this time until after the present appeal was lodged. The harassment complaint was investi- gated by the University and dismissed without merit. Ms. Potts informed the Tribunal that much of the material used by the Appellant to ground this complaint was dis- closed to the Trust in the course of its requests.[17] The attempts to resolve the dispute are evidenced in Ms. Potts’ statement. She contrasts this with the Trust’s decisions to publish their own perspective (as she de- scribes, to “name and shame” alleged transgressors) on the dispute online, and al- leging that at times OUIHC’s Wikipedia page had been edited to redirect readers to the Trust’s website. Burden of Compliance: [18] Ms. Potts provided the evidence for the burden of complying with the Trust’s previous requests, requiring consultation with twenty-three individuals and taking more than twenty hours. She observes as well, that the Appellant made a subject access request for information held by the University, but with the exception of in- formation pertaining to him as a former student and staff member. Ms. Potts states that this left only information relating to his involvement with ice hockey. The request was complied with, and eighty-six pages were disclosed, taking eight hours for the Compliance Team to process. She gave evidence that this, along with all the other ice hockey requests with the exception of the instant request, requires an estimated compliance time of eighty-eight to one hundred hours. This is unprecedented for re- quests regarding university sports. [19] Regarding the other requests, they came from whatdotheyknow.com and use names that the University accepts are not transparently associated with the Trust or any known journalists; however, from a glance at their account history, these particu- lar usernames have only ever made requests to the University pertaining to this dis- pute. This would lead the University to conclude that they are not journalists but are in some way connected to the Trust. This suspicion is further heightened by the heated language used in some of the requests, with allegations and insinuations of misconduct in destroying, concealing or altering information. Finally, the responses to these requests are referenced and linked on Trust-affiliated websites.[20] The Appellant’s request as it stands would encompass thousands of email ad- dresses, covering three years of communications that would capture a significant amount of personal data and potentially require consultation with a vast number of individuals. If s14 had not been applied, the request would exceed the cost limit un- der s12 in any event. As the attempts at reconciliation stalled in 2014, there is unlikely in Ms. Pott’s estimation to exist any further material that could assist in re- solving the dispute that has not already been disclosed to the Trust. THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD: WITNESS STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR EWAN MCKENDRICK [21] The Tribunal noted a comment made by the Appellant in his grounds of appeal, which suggested that Professor McKendrick was line manager to Ms. Emma Potts (p.14). Whilst not explicitly stated, this appeared to the Tribunal to be suggesting that Professor McKendrick was insufficiently independent of the handling of the original request. Consequently the Tribunal directed that Professor McKendrick provide a witness statement setting out his involvement in the dispute, which he did on the 24th November 2016. In his statement Professor McKendrcick set out: “I only participated in one conference call with representatives of the Trust on 7 October 2014. I recall that Emma Potts was also involved with this call and that the relevant Trust representatives informed me within the two weeks thereafter that they had resigned from the Trust.” (para.4) “I was not otherwise involved in the dispute. I was not responsible for line managing Ms. Potts during the period in question because, in her role as Di- rector of Student Administration and Services, she was line managed by the Deputy Registrar, Michael Silby.” (para.5) [22] The Tribunal is satisfied that Professor McKendrick’s very limited involvement in the dispute does not sufficiently affect his independence in a way which would ren- der his internal review invalid.[23] The University adopted Ms. Potts’ statement, reiterating the cost of compliance issues and confirming that the University stopped actively pursuing a resolution of the dispute in February 2014. INFORMATION COMMISSIONER SUBMISSIONS [24] The Information Commissioner submitted that in her view: - i) the Appellant’s subject access request is a relevant part of the course of dealings between the Appellant and the University as it appears to be connected to the ongoing dispute; ii) if it were to be established that Professor McKendrick was involved in, or con- nected to the dispute in any way this would be a relevant factor and would diminish his independence. THE APPELLANT [25] Despite the Tribunal’s Directions, which were sent to all parties, and having been copied in to submissions from the First and Second Respondents, the Tribunal had received no submissions from the Appellant by the time of the second hearing on the papers on 20th December 2016. A copy of the Tribunal’s Directions was sent out in error following this and, whilst the First and Second Respondents sent further copies of their submissions, the Appellant sent none. On the 3rd January 2017 the Tribunal corresponded with the Appellant and made clear that no submissions had been received from him. On the same day the Appellant requested an extension of 28 days for his submissions, claiming that he had not understood the date by which these should have been made. The Second Respondent objected to this request stating that it had been clear from the Tribunal’s Directions when these should have been submitted. We are not satisfied that the Appellant has given any adequate reasons for an extension of time for him to respond further and in any event we do not consider it is in the public interest to delay the matter further.[26] The Tribunal further agrees with the Second Respondent. The timing of submis- sions was clear from Directions 3 and 4, which read as follows: Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3. The Response from the second Respondent and all submissions, inter-alia, ad- dressing the points outlined in 2 (ii) are to be served on the Tribunal within 28 days. 4. Within 14 days of receipt of a copy of the items served pursuant to (3) above, all Parties may serve submissions in response Mr R Lubbock v Information Commissioner - EA/2016/0081 3.

[27] Accordingly the request by the Appellant for an extension of the time in which to make submissions is denied. Conclusions: [28] Despite the Directions issued by the Tribunal, the Appellant has provided no additional information in relation to the meeting with the University and also did not reply to any issues arising in the submissions or witness statement provided by the University or the further submissions from the Commissioner. [29] Specifically the Appellant did not rebut the information in the witness statement of Emma Potts which referred to the other requestors who ‘use names that the Uni- versity accepts are not transparently associated with the Trust or any known journal- ists’ and that their account history shows that these particular usernames have only ever made requests to the University pertaining to this dispute. [30] In his Grounds of Appeal the Appellant states that no evidence has been pro- vided by the University that ‘the other requests came from individuals associated with the Trust and not from journalists or interested third parties’ but the Tribunal notes that the Appellant has not provided any evidence to the contrary, for example to show that they are journalists. [31] The detailed understanding of the issues which were demonstrated by these other requestors, both in the wording of their requests and in their comprehensivechallenges to the information provided by the University in response to their re- quests, and the fact that their usernames have not been linked to any other requests, leads the Tribunal to accept, on the balance of probabilities, that these other re- questors have, at the very least, had discussion with the requestors and that these requests can, in our view properly be considered as part of the history of the Trust’s requests. [32] For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal upholds the Commissioner’s Decision Notice and dismisses the appeal. Our decision is unanimous. Brian Kennedy QC 6 February 2017."

The appeal is dismissed. 2. The Penalty Notice dated 19 August 2019 is confirmed. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is a data controller within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”). As such, it is required to comply with the Data Protection (Charges 1 and Information) Regulations 2018 (“the Regulations”)2. As a “tier 1” organisation, the Appellant’s fee was £400. 4. The Appellant failed to provide the Respondent with the information required by regulation 2 (3) of the Regulations or to pay to the Respondent the Data Protection Fee required by regulation 2 (2) of the Regulations by the compliance date of 30 June 2018. 5. The Respondent served a Notice of Intent on 28 February 2019 and, in the absence of any representations from the Appellant, served a Penalty Notice of £400 on 19 August 2019. 6. The Appellant has appealed to this Tribunal on the basis that its default was an innocent mistake and asks that the penalty be revoked. Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 3 September 2019 relies on grounds that the school secretary had been absent due to ill health for much of the preceding year. The Appellant’s former head teacher had left the school. Ms Darcy, the new head teacher who appeals on behalf of the Appellant, took up her post on 2 September 2019 and became aware of the oversight at that stage. 8. The Respondent’s Response dated 23 October 2019 resists the appeal. She submits that the Penalty regime has been established by Parliament and that there is no requirement to issue reminders (although a reminder was fact been sent in this case). It is accepted that the Appellant’s failure to comply with the Regulations was due to an oversight, but it is submitted that the imposition of a Penalty was appropriate in all the 1 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents 2 The Regulations were made under s. 137 DPA. See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/480/contents/made 2circumstances. The Respondent notes that the Appellant had been a data controller prior to the commencement of the Regulations and had paid the relevant fees under the earlier legislation so should have had relevant administrative systems in place. It is submitted that the level of penalty is appropriate. 9. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 45 pages. The Law 10. The Regulations came into force on 25 May 2018. They replace the previously applicable regulations, made in 2000. Regulation 2 requires a data controller to pay an annual charge to the Information Commissioner (unless their data processing is exempt). It also requires the data controller to supply the Information Commissioner with specified information so that she can determine the relevant charge, based on turnover and staff numbers. 11. A breach of the Regulations is a matter falling under s. 149 (5) of the DPA. Section 155 (1) of the DPA provides that the Information Commissioner may serve a Penalty Notice on a person who breaches their duties under the Regulations. S. 158 of the DPA requires the Information Commissioner to set a fixed penalty for such a breach, which she has done in her publicly-available Regulatory Action Policy3. The specified penalty for a tier 1 organisation which breached regulation 2(2) is £400. The statutory maximum penalty is £4,350, which will be appropriate where there are aggravating factors. 12. Schedule 16 to the DPA makes provision as to the procedure for serving Penalty Notices, which includes the service of a Notice of Intent written inviting representations. 13. An appeal against a Penalty Notice is brought under s. 162(1)(d) DPA. S.162(3) DPA provides that “A person who is given a penalty notice or a penalty variation notice may appeal to the Tribunal against the amount of the penalty specified in the notice, whether or not the person appeals against the notice.” 14. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is established by s. 163 DPA, as follows: 163 Determination of appeals (1) Subsections (2) to (4) apply where a person appeals to the Tribunal under section 162(1) or (3). 3 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 3(2) The Tribunal may review any determination of fact on which the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought was based. (3) If the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice or decision involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that the Commissioner ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute another notice or decision which the Commissioner could have given or made. (4) Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. … 15. I note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. 16. It is increasingly common for the General Regulatory Chamber to determine appeals against financial penalties imposed by civil regulators. In appeals against Fixed Penalty Notices issued by the Pensions Regulator, tribunal judges have frequently adopted the approach of asking whether a defaulting Appellant has a “reasonable excuse” for their default, notwithstanding the fact that this concept is not expressly referred to in the legislation. This approach was approved by the Upper Tribunal in The Pensions Regulator v Strathmore Medical Practice [2018] UKUT 104 (AAC).4 There is much case law concerning what is an is not a “reasonable excuse” and it is inevitably fact-specific. An oft-cited definition is the one used by the VAT Tribunal (as it then was) in The Clean Car Company v HMRC (LON/90/1381X) as follows: “…the question of whether a particular trader had a reasonable excuse should be judged by the standards of reasonableness which one would expect to be exhibited by a taxpayer who had a responsible attitude to his duties as a taxpayer, but who in other respects shared such attributes of the particular appellant as the tribunal considered relevant to the situation being considered. Thus though such a taxpayer would give a reasonable priority to complying with his duties in regard to tax and would conscientiously seek to ensure that his returns were accurate and made timeously, his age and experience, his health or the incidence of some particular difficulty or misfortune and, doubtless, many other facts, may all have a bearing on whether, in acting as he did, he acted reasonably and so had a reasonable excuse….” 4 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5acf131ee5274a76be66c11a/MISC_3112_2017-00.pdf 4The Facts 17. There appears to be no dispute between the parties as to the facts in this case. The Appellant implicitly accepts that it received the relevant Notices. 18. The Appellant expressly accepts that it was in breach of its legal obligations under the Regulations on the relevant date. It has since paid the requisite fee. 19. The Appellant has not provided any corroborating evidence of the length of the school secretary’s absence through ill health, or of any other staffing issues that might have contributed to the oversight. 20. The Respondent has provided the Tribunal with copies of reminder letters sent to the Appellant on 6 June 2018 and 17 August 2018, and copies of the Notice of Intend and Fixed Penalty Notice. 21. Conclusion 22. I have considered whether the Appellant has advanced a reasonable excuse for its failure to comply with the Regulations. I conclude that it has not. I conclude that a reasonable data controller would have systems in place to comply with the Regulations. Although the Appellant has pointed to a particular difficulty arising from the absence of the school secretary, I find that this does not fully explain its departure from the expected standards of a reasonable data controller. 23. I have considered whether there is any basis for departing from the Respondent’s policy as to the imposition of a £400 fixed fee in the circumstances of this case. I have concluded that there is not. The Appellant was sent the Notices required under the Regulations and has failed to take any action in response to earlier correspondence. 24. Having regard to the relevant principles, I note that the Appellant in this case has not presented any evidence of financial hardship which could affect the penalty. 25. I see no reason to depart from the Respondent’s assessment of the appropriate penalty. 26. For all these reasons, the appeal is now dismissed and the Penalty Notice is confirmed.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Mr Sanders explained to the tribunal that he was involved in proceedings in the County Court relating to his leasehold flat; these were transferred to the Residential Property Tribunal in 2009. He was unhappy with procedural decisions made by the tribunal hearing his case. He spoke to tribunal staff and was told that he could complain to the President of the tribunal. He did so at some time between June and August 2009; she responded indicating that it was not for her to intervene. He continued to be dissatisfied. He unsuccessfully appealed the decision of the tribunal. 2. He said in March 2011 he sued the three members of the tribunal for misfeasance in public office. In about 2015 the Ministry of justice applied to be joined as a defendant and subsequently successfully applied for the proceedings to be struck out. 3. During the course of these proceedings Mr Sanders sent two communications, one to an email address at the First-tier Tribunal (Residential Property) (which discharges the functions of the Residential Property Tribunal following the re-organisation of tribunals under the provisions of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act) and the other to the judge who had been President of the Residential Property Tribunal in 2009. The request for information 4. Both communications are lengthy and are set out in full in the decision notice, however for convenience of analysis they are summarised. 5. The communication of 18 December 2014 makes reference to “matters arising in 2009 and thereafter” and there are then 12 numbered paragraphs. Paragraph 1 quotes from a tribunal document explaining the procedure of the tribunal, paragraph 2 claims “there is some ambiguity”, paragraphs 3-11 then explore hypothetical situations raised by Mr Sander’s litigation, and 3-7 deal with the role of the President 2Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 culminating in: “7. If the president appears corrupt and denies he/she has any responsibility..” Paragraphs 8-11 deal with members of the tribunal culminating in: “11. In the alternative, are the aforementioned paid not to resolve such disputes… whilst continuing to accept their salary as paid for out of the public purse?” Paragraph 12 asks for information: “Please provide all the information held on and around these subjects as disclosed hereinabove in this email.” 6. On Christmas morning 2014 Mr Sanders wrote to the judge about issues raised in his litigation in 9 numbered paragraphs preceded by: “2. I wrote to you on 8 July 2010. You have evaded and/or failed to deal lawfully or at all inter alia the following complaints and requests for information which were part of the aforementioned correspondence..” The communication concluded: “Kindly therefore reply in full in accordance with your duties and my rights without further prevarication, evasion or delay. Please provide all the information held on and around the subjects referred to and/or touched on herein. I register a further formal complaint with regard to your personal misconduct as demonstrated inter alia by your refusal to engage with the quoted paragraphs.” 7. The Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”) in refusing to comply with these requests stated that neither “request” fell within s8 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”)which provides:- “8 Request for information. (1)In this Act any reference to a “request for information” is a reference to such a request which— (a)is in writing, (b)states the name of the applicant and an address for correspondence, and (c)describes the information requested…” 8. The MoJ told Mr Sanders that:- “Your requests for information do not describe the information sought, they pose many questions requiring clarification or opinion on 3Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 matters in respect of your legal matters. The FOIA only covers recorded information rather than advice or opinion.” 9. The MoJ further argued that the communication addressed to the judge was not within FOIA as it was not addressed to a public authority as required by s3:- “Public authorities (1)In this Act “public authority” means— (a)subject to section 4(4), any body which, any other person who, or the holder of any office which— (i)is listed in Schedule 1, or (ii)is designated by order under section 5, or (b)a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6.” The complaint to the Information Commissioner 10. Mr Sanders complained to the Information Commissioner (“ICO”). In considering whether the communications were valid requests within s8 she noted the argument of the MoJ that: “it is not possible for the MoJ to conduct a search for “all information” around a hypothetical event, or indeed why an individual has acted towards or responded to the requester in a certain way. Much of the requester’s correspondence asks for clarity around situations or events which does not meet the criteria for recorded information..” While acknowledging that there was a low threshold for the description of the information in the request she concluded that the communications were not requests for information, rather Mr Sanders was using FOIA as a means of advancing his arguments concerning his dispute with the MoJ. The ICO considered the definition of a public authority. She noted the position she had taken with respect to a previous similar request that the judiciary were not within s3 FOIA. She relied on a decision of the First-tier Tribunal which upheld that decision. She concluded that a judge did not fall within the definition and accordingly the Christmas morning communication to the judge was not a valid request for this reason also. 4Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 The appeal to the Tribunal 11. Mr Sanders’ notice of appeal consists of 20 numbered paragraphs. Paragraphs 1-9 are criticisms of the tribunal panel which considered his case in 2009, paragraph 10 criticises the ICO. Mr Sanders argues in paragraphs 11-12 that the judge “could not only have been a member of an independent judiciary since she had various email addresses… some were HMCS/HMCTS addresses and some of these were/are judicial email addresses”. Paragraphs 13-16 deal with possible complaint procedures for dealing with a complaint against a judge, paragraphs 17-20 criticise the MoJ and the ICO’s acceptance of information provided by the MoJ. 12. The ICO resisted the appeal relying on the reasoning of her decision notice. With respect to the status of the judge she argued:- “the Appellant does not appear to dispute that [the judge] was a member of the judiciary, but instead appears to submit that she was not necessarily acting as a member of the judiciary when she received the Second Request. … The Commissioner considers that a judge will likely perform a number of functions that would fall within the remit of the judiciary, and submits that the Appellant has failed to set out why [the judge] was not acting as a member of the judiciary at the time of the request. … The Commissioner does not consider the use of a HMCTS email address to indicate that [the judge] was acting otherwise than as a member of the judiciary.” . 13. The Commissioner also noted that Mr Sanders was fully aware of the MoJ FOIA procedures “yet chose to submit the Second Request directly to [the judge], a point which is indisputable given that the email was addressed directly to her. This indicates that the purpose of the second Request was to obtain information from her which was connected with her judicial function, rather than requesting information from the MoJ in the usual manner.” 14. In responding to the ICO’s case Mr Sanders argued that he had not written solely to the judge on Christmas Day 2014 since: “the email in question was also sent to numerous other recipients all of whom were either employees of HMCTS or the generic inbox for RPT London (HMCTS) enquiries”. He suggested that in 2010 he was not aware that the judge was a judge when he first wrote to her. He noted the ICO’s position that judges were constitutionally separate from the administration and 5Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 argued that: “Judges do not have HMCS/HMCTS email addresses as standard unless they also perform some other non-judicial role”. 15. In the tribunal Mr Sanders argued that it was a factual question whether the individual was only a judge and he suggested that she may have had another role. He pointed to the difficulty a requester had of knowing what precise information was held which would answer his request, and said that he had been seeking information of how a President of a tribunal exercises her responsibilities. He had not been exploring hypothetical scenarios but had been trying to get information to move forwards. He noted that the MoJ had argued that a previous request to them had been vexatious; however that had been totally different. Consideration 16. In his appeal Mr Sanders has not challenged the reasoning of the ICO that a judge is not a public authority within s3 FOIA. Although Mr Sanders claimed that when he first wrote to the judge in 2010 to complain about the conduct of a tribunal panel he was not aware that he was writing to a judge, when he wrote on Christmas Day 2014 he did know. Although he claims that the possession of a HMCTS email address points to the judge exercising a non-judicial function and that a complaints function with respect to members of a tribunal may not be a judicial function, these propositions are neither evidence nor convincing arguments. The possession of an email address may simply be a convenience and a matter of how the email system of a particular tribunal has been administered. The role of a President of a tribunal includes handling complaints about tribunal members, however this complaint handling does not extend to the content of their judicial decisions. That is a matter for appeal. The tribunal is satisfied that the ICO was correct to conclude that Mr Sanders wrote to the judge about her judicial work. The fact that he copied the email to other recipients is irrelevant. He wrote to her, complaining about her actions and sought a reply from her. 17. Furthermore the content of both communications was not seeking information that was likely to be held. They were written against the background of a claim alleging misconduct and they advance arguments and criticisms. They were a misuse of the statutory procedure for the purpose of conducting a dispute, not to seek information. 6Appeal No: EA/2017/ 0070 18. The tribunal is satisfied that the ICO in her decision correctly analysed the factual position and came to the only possible conclusion with respect to s3 and s8. 19. This appeal is without merit and is dismissed. 20. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 3 October 2017 7"

Gaskin Respondent: The Information Commissioner Judge: NJ Warren Member: N Watson Member: S Shaw Hearing Date: 5 June Decision Date: 1 July 2014 DECISION NOTICE 1. About two years ago the Tribunal gave a decision dismissing Mrs Gaskin’s appeal on the papers. They were wrong to do so because she had not consented to that procedure. She appealed to the Upper Tribunal. 2. The Upper Tribunal identified the error of law in the First-tier Tribunal’s decision and then at paragraphs 31 onwards discussed “what happens next”. 3. The Upper Tribunal Judge explained that he had given serious consideration to refusing to set aside the First-tier Tribunal’s decision because of doubts whether Mrs Gaskin could succeed. However, given the absence of the oral hearing which had been requested, he allowed the appeal, set aside the Tribunal decision and remitted the matter for rehearing before a new Tribunal. He added that the possibility of the case being struck out without a hearing remained. 4. This Tribunal decided to list the case for a hearing. 5. In October 2013 Mrs Gaskin applied late in the day for an adjournment on medical grounds. The adjournment was granted. The case was relisted for hearing inDecision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2011/0101 Appellant: Mrs S.F. Gaskin Date of decision: 1 July 2014 December 2013. Mrs Gaskin applied for a postponement relying on a letter from her doctor recommending that she take things easy for four to six weeks. The postponement was granted. The case was relisted for hearing in February 2014. Again, there was a late adjournment request from Mrs Gaskin on the ground that she was not fit to attend. The Tribunal again adjourned the case, this time with a warning that any future adjournment was unlikely. 6. The case was relisted for hearing on 5 June 2014. On 3 June 2014 Mrs Gaskin applied again for an adjournment on the ground that a recent blood test had required an urgent appointment at the local hospital and that rest was required. Having regard to all the circumstances, we concluded that it was in the interests of justice to refuse the application for an adjournment. We considered that it was in the interests of justice to proceed although neither party to the case attended. 7. Mrs Gaskin has had a series of disputes with English Heritage about building work in the precincts of Norwich Cathedral. 8. As long ago as May 2009 she wrote a letter to English Heritage. Most of the letter concerns the use of a protocol to threaten judicial review proceedings in the High Court but there is one paragraph which constitutes a request for information. It seems to be a request for all the copy documents which the director of English Heritage East had relied on for an assertion in another letter that there was “consultation” about developments at 56A, B and C, The Close. (The Tribunal papers also contain (page 35) another request apparently under the Environmental Information Regulations in respect of developments at the Stable Range in Ferry Lane. This is not the subject of this appeal). 9. English Heritage’s position throughout has been that they have shown Mrs Gaskin all the information which they hold. Mrs Gaskin was dissatisfied with this and complained to the Information Commissioner (ICO). The process then followed by the ICO is not easy to follow but it resulted in the issue of a decision notice on 14 March 2011 which found in favour of English Heritage. Mrs Gaskin then lodged her appeal to the Tribunal. The Grounds of Appeal are not easy to follow either.Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2011/0101 Appellant: Mrs S.F. Gaskin Date of decision: 1 July 2014 10. To assist Mrs Gaskin the Tribunal issued a case management note in October 2013 indicating that it seemed from the Notice of Appeal that her concerns were limited to two files which were reported missing. She was asked to confirm whether or not this was the case; she was also asked what remedy she sought from the Tribunal. 11. After the February adjournment another case management note indicated to Mrs Gaskin that the Tribunal’s provisional interpretation of her response to the October 2013 case management note was that:- “(a) The issue she wishes the Tribunal to consider is that of the two missing files. (b) There are other persons, including the surveyor for the fabric of the cathedral who are likely to hold similar information.” If this was a misinterpretation then Mrs Gaskin was asked to write to the Tribunal explaining why. Having considered Mrs Gaskin’s reply to that case management note we consider it reasonable to proceed on the basis that the provisional interpretation contained in it is correct. 12. The ICO considered that English Heritage were wrong to have dealt with Mrs Gaskin’s request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). He considered that the correct legal regime was the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). We have our doubts about this but it makes no difference to the outcome of this appeal. 13. In respect of the two missing files we accept the evidence of the corporate records manager at English Heritage in a detailed letter which is contained at pages 51-54 of the bundle. The letter displays a careful and diligent approach and we have no reason to doubt the statement that the two files are missing. In our judgment, the ICO was correct to decide that English Heritage did not hold any more information. 14. The second point raised by Mrs Gaskin seems to be that it would be open to English Heritage to reconstruct the files by going to various other bodies who might hold material identical to that which the files contained. No doubt English HeritageDecision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2011/0101 Appellant: Mrs S.F. Gaskin Date of decision: 1 July 2014 could do this if they wished to. It is not for the Tribunal, however, to tell them to do so. Our role is limited to considering whether English Heritage has fulfilled its obligations under FOIA or the EIR. 15. On the facts, no question arises here of a breach of Regulation 10 EIR. This is partly because the request asks for the information considered by an English Heritage employee and partly because Mrs Gaskin is herself well aware of the institutions which may hold similar information. 16. For these reasons we conclude that there are no grounds to interfere with the ICO decision and the appeal is dismissed. NJ Warren Chamber President Dated 1 July 2014"

Date of Decision: 9th March 2015 BEFORE Fiona Henderson (Judge) Anne Chafer And Dave Sivers 1Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 Subject matter: S12 FOIA – the costs limit S16 FOIA – Advice and Assistance Decision: The Appeal is Refused REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This appeal is against the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice dated 7th August 2014 which held that the Ministry of Justice had correctly applied s12 FOIA. 2. The Appellant wrote to the Ministry of Justice asking for1: 1. Excluding those prisoners classified as “provisional Category A” would you please tell me how many Category A prisoners in 2013 were recommended for a downgrade in classification to Category B by the Local Advisory Panel [LAP] at: [5 named prisons] 2. With specific reference to each of the aforementioned prisons how many of the LAP recommendations were rejected by the Director of High Security? 3 (i) Can the figures in 1 and 2 above be broken down into mainstream: [vulnerable prisoners]? 3 (ii) How many Category A prisoners were downgraded by the Director on his own initiative? 4(i) On average/on any fixed date how many prisoners were categorised as Category A in 2013? 4(ii) With regard to Category A prisoners is there information available as to: a) length of time spent on Category A b) types of offences c) offenders’ age 1 The Appellant’s original request included two requests numbered 3 and two requests numbered 4. The Tribunal has renumbered the requests 3(i), 3(ii), 4(i) and 4(ii) for ease of reference within this decision. 2Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 5. If the answer to 4[ii] is no, is there any research ongoing/planned for such data to be made available? 3. The Ministry of Justice responded on 10th March 2014 confirming that it holds the information but refusing to provide it because the cost of compliance exceeded the appropriate limit. They did however, provide the Appellant with some information stating that it was released outside the scope of FOIA and on a discretionary basis. An internal review on 1st May 2014 upheld the decision on the same grounds. 4. The Appellant’s complaint to the Commissioner was accepted on 22nd May 2014. In its submissions to the Commissioner, the MOJ confirmed that contrary to their assertion in the internal review, the cost limit was not exceeded responding to s3(i) alone but they relied upon the aggregated cost of answering 3(i) and 4 (ii). Following an investigation the Commissioner upheld the MOJ’s reliance on s12 in relation to the aggregated request. The Appeal 5. The Appellant appealed on 21st September 2014 on the grounds that manual searching of paper records was not the only method of gathering the requested information, and that the MOJ was over-estimating the number of records that would require searching. He confirmed that the MOJ had provided some answers to questions 1, 2, 3(ii) and 4(i)2 so that the issue outstanding for the Appeal related to questions 3(i) 4(ii) and 5. 6. The Tribunal heard oral submissions and evidence by video link from the Appellant. The MOJ did not apply to be joined and the Commissioner was not represented at the oral hearing, relying upon his decision notice and his response to the Appeal. The Tribunal was provided with an open bundle comprising some 89 pages. Scope 7. The Appellant argued before the Tribunal and in his witness statement that the questions posed in elements 4(ii) and 5 of his request were phrased in such a way that they required a “yes” or “no” answer3. He relies upon question 5 being phrased 2 37, 21, none and 1023 respectively p45. Although the MOJ revised their response to element 3i before the commissioner stating that this information was not held as “ the department confirmed it had no record of the Deputy Director of Custody downgrading Category A prisoners on his own initiative” p83 3 is there information available..? 3Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 “if the answer is “no”...” in support of this construction of the request. We are satisfied that whether the request in element 4(ii) was asking whether the data was held or for the data itself, if the data were not held the answer would be “no” in both cases and that therefore this does not inform the construction of element 4(ii). 8. Whilst we are satisfied that an information request should be read objectively and the public authority should not try to second guess what it believes is behind the request, it must also be read reasonably. In his oral submissions to the Tribunal the Appellant explained that what he wanted to obtain was a pre-prepared data set as he would have expected the retrieval of the information to be a lengthy process. However, whilst that might have been his intention, that was not specified in the wording of the request. 9. The Tribunal accepts that it is possible to read the questions as asking whether the information detailed is held or not but we are satisfied that it would be an overly restricted and unhelpful reading of the question likely to prompt an immediate request for the actual data if it is held. It is also an unnecessary question for a data requestor to ask since any person asking for data is entitled to be told whether the information is held or not: s1(1) FOIA provides: (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled - (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. Consequently asking whether information is held but not asking for it would serve no purpose and militates against reading a request phrased in the terms “is “x” available?” restrictively and overly literally. 10. We are supported in this construction by the Appellant’s position in relation to element 3(i); whilst he emphasised the part of the question stating “Can the figures... [be broken down]?”4 in his written submissions, it was apparent from the rest of his submissions that despite the way the question was phrased he was expecting to be provided with the actual figures and not to be provided with a “yes/no” answer. The public authority must be consistent in its construction of requests. 11. We are satisfied that a reasonable construction of: is there any research ongoing/planned...? 4 p18 Bundle paragraph 8 4Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 <U+F0B7> “Is there information available...” in this context equates to “please give me...”. and <U+F0B7> Can the figures in 1 and 2 above be broken down into mainstream: [vulnerable prisoners]? is equivalent to “Please would you break the total into 2 data sets if you hold the information in that way”. In light of the detail in all the other questions and the fact that they were asking for numerical data, it was reasonable to construe the outstanding elements of the request as being requests for the data referred to in the questions. The costs limit 12. S12 provides that: “Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit”. 13. The limit applicable to the MOJ as a branch of central Government is £600 which when calculated at the rate specified in the regulations of £25 per hour equates to a time limit of 18 hours. Regulation 5(2) allows requests which to any extent relate to the same or similar information to be aggregated. The Appellant accepts that 5 aggregation is applicable and we are satisfied that it was permissible under the regulations. 14. In determining whether complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit the MOJ are limited to the time spent: <U+F0B7> Determining whether it holds the information, <U+F0B7> Locating the information, or a document containing it <U+F0B7> Retrieving the information or a document containing it and <U+F0B7> Extracting the information from a document containing it. 5 Paragraph 19 witness statement 5Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 15. The MOJ conceded before the Commissioner that contrary to the information provided to the Appellant in their internal review, answering question 3(i) would require the review of 37 files and that this would not on its own exceed the costs limit. The MOJ’s evidence to the Commissioner was that in relation to element 3(i) the information is not held centrally and “manual searching of prisoner files is the only method of gathering the information, therefore it is the quickest... a sampling exercise was carried out by NOMS High Security on prisoner files and it is estimated that it would take approximately 25 minutes to locate this information for each prisoner”. 16. The Appellant disputes that answering this question would require the inspection of any files at all because he asserts that every day each prison completes a roll call in which the Category A and B prisoners are listed separately and that the vulnerable prisoners would appear on logs relating to specific wings because they are kept separate from the mainstream Category A prisoners for their own protection. He argues that the records of these logs would provide the information. In addition we express surprise at the length of time assessed as necessary to find a single fact (namely whether a prisoner is classed as vulnerable or not) which is said to take 25 minutes whereas the MOJ’s estimate of the time taken to find a more complex piece of information (namely whether a prisoner has been downgraded and then re- categorised) was estimated to take only 15 minutes6. However, in light of our findings in relation to element 4(ii) and the MOJ’s concession that this element of the request would not exceed the costs limit if considered alone we have not found it necessary to obtain further evidence upon this point. 17. In relation to element 4(ii) we are satisfied that the data being requested is the length of time each individual category A prisoner has spent on Category A, the type of offence(s) that they were convicted of and their age7. Whilst it appears that some data relating to age and offence type might be readily available8 the MOJ asserted that the length of time a prisoner had spent as Category A is not recorded centrally but located within the individual prisoner files and requires manual searching as the only method to locate this information. They note that the search is complicated because in some instances a prisoner may have been downgraded and then re 6 P85 bundle 7 In his oral evidence the Appellant explained that he would have wanted the information relating to category A prisoners from 2011-13 although this was not specified as the Appellant’s intention was to find out if a pre prepared data set existed and then if it did to request it subsequently. 8 P49 bundle 6Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 categorised back to category A. They estimate that this would take 15 minutes per file and that taking the figure of 1,0309 category A prisoners would amount to over 250 hours. Whilst the Appellant is surprised that the information is not computerised, he conceded for the purposes of the appeal that the information sought had to be retrieved from paper files. He also accepted that the time it would take to retrieve the information from paper files would significantly exceed the cost allowance. 18. We are satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the information has to be retrieved from the paper files and that 15 minutes was a reasonable estimate of the time required to locate each file and to retrieve the information from it especially as there was an element of calculation involved. In light of the number of files that would have to be reviewed in relation to element 4(ii) the costs limit would be exceeded. Since the MOJ were entitled to aggregate the request they were entitled to apply s12 costs limit to the whole request. Advice and Assistance 19. S16 FOIA provides that (1) It shall be the duty10 of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it. 20. The MOJ sought to argue before the Commissioner that the information provided to the Appellant was assistance in accordance with the scheme11. They did not purport to provide it on that basis in their letter of refusal at the time that the information was given; stating that it was on a “discretionary basis” outside the scope of FOIA12. The Appellant has noted that the information they provided in relation to elements 1 and 2 was provided as a collective number when it had been requested in relation to 5 prisons. The Tribunal observes that it is likely that when it was received it came from the individual prisons and the reason for not providing it in that form is not clear, 9 This is the number of category A prisoners said to be held at the date of the request p85 Bundle, although 1,023 was given as the answer to the average number of prisoners in this category 10 Emphasis added 11 P85 bundle 12 P45 7Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 especially as the equivalent data relating to previous years had been provided on a prison by prison basis13. 21. The Tribunal endorses the Commissioner’s comments reminding the MOJ of their duty under s16 to provide advice and assistance which in our judgment has still not been complied with although it now appears that all of the request could be answered within the cost limit (subject to clarification of the time frame for 4(ii) b and c) apart from element 4(ii)(a) but this was not made apparent to the Appellant by the MOJ. The position was further obscured by the MOJ’s erroneous calculation that answering element 3(i) alone would exceed the cost limit. Other Matters 22. The Appellant is in his third year of doctoral research for a literature based PhD examining the work of the High Security Prison Group, Category A prisoners and psychology based Offender Behaviour Programmes. The Tribunal is aware that the Appellant has made requests for information relating to prisoners in the past and the MOJ response has often been to engage the s12 exemption but to offer “discretionary” information in response to some of the requests. In their internal review the MOJ included a paragraph stating: “The MOJ can decline to deal with a customer where that customer’s correspondence or dealings with the department place unreasonable demands or pressures upon its staff... Please be aware that we will consider engaging section 14 if you continue with correspondence regarding these matters” 14 23. The Tribunal observes that in a case where the MOJ have provided incorrect information in relation to their use of s12 (wrongly asserting that the cost limit was exceeded in relation to element 3(i) alone), and has failed to offer advice and assistance in accordance with their duty under s16 to enable an Appellant to frame their request in such a way as to come within the costs limit; it does not consider it appropriate to attempt to limit further correspondence with the threat of treating a request as vexatious, when the further correspondence arises in part out of the MOJ’s unhelpful handling of the request. Conclusion 13 P87 14 P50 8Mr Simon Price v Information Commissioner EA/2014/0241 24. For the reasons set out above we refuse the appeal. Our decision is unanimous.

"39","FOI","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case Number EA/2018/0170 (INFORMATION RIGHTS) GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER FOR WARWICKSHIRE Second Respondent Heard in public at Field House on 27 and 28 August 2019 Before Judge Alison McKenna (CP) Rosalind Tatam Marion Saunders Attendances: For the Appellant: Jude Bunting, counsel, instructed by Liberty For the First Respondent: Christopher Knight, counsel, instructed by The Information Commissioner's Office For the Second Respondent: Alex Ustych, counsel, instructed by Warwickshire County Council Legal Services Crown Copyright © 2019 1DECISION ON EA/2018/0170 The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 10 July 2018 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS Introduction 1. Privacy International is a charity which campaigns for the protection of the right to privacy. On 1 November 2016, it made a number of information requests, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (""FOIA""), to police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners and other public authorities seeking information relating to the purchase, use and regulation of equipment falling under the umbrella term of ""Covert Communications Data Capture"" (""CCDC""), in particular equipment known as ""International Mobile Subscriber Identity (""IMSI"") Catchers"". 2. This appeal concerns the response of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Warwickshire (""PCCW"") to that request. PCCW took the view that the requested information was exempt from disclosure under sections 24(1) and 31 (1) FOIA and that the public interest favoured maintaining those exemptions. Privacy International complained to the Information Commissioner. 3. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50728057 on 10 July 2018, in which she decided that PCCW was entitled to rely on s. 24 (1) FOIA to refuse to provide the requested information and that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption. She did not determine the engagement of s. 31 (1) FOIA. Privacy International appealed to the Tribunal. 4. The Tribunal directed an oral hearing of two cases, of which this is one. They were heard together on 27 and 28 August 2019. There are seven extant appeals arising from the original series of information requests. These have been stayed pending the outcome of these two appeals. 5. The Tribunal received open and closed evidence in this appeal and heard open and closed submissions. Privacy International was not provided with the closed material as it constituted the withheld information or was revelatory of it. Privacy International's representatives left the hearing room for the closed evidence and submissions but were provided with a ""gist"" when the Tribunal resumed in open session. Accordingly, there is a closed annexe to this Decision which deals with the closed material and our conclusions about it. This will not be disclosed to Privacy International. 6. This is the Tribunal's decision in relation to PCCW only. Our Decision in the other case we heard, EA/2018/0164, will be issued separately. In case they are not promulgated together, the time limit for making an application for permission to appeal in both cases is extended so that it is 28 days after the date of promulgation of the second of the Tribunal's Decisions. The request for information 7. On 1 November 2016, Privacy International made the following request to PCCW: ""I am writing on behalf of ... to seek records ...relating to the purchase and use of mobile phone surveillance equipment by the Warwickshire police forces. 2I refer, in particular, to the recent article written by the journalist collective The Bristol Cable titled ""Revealed: Bristol's police and mass mobile surveillance"". The article makes reference to the minutes of an Alliance Governance Group meeting in May 2016 between Warwickshire and West Mercia Police in which the topic of ... CCDC equipment was discussed. Specifically, the minutes record that three options relating to ""CCDC replacement"" were discussed: 'Option one -upgrading the existing equipment with the current supplier. Option two -replacing the existing equipment with the current supplier's new product. Option three -Replacing the existing equipment with a new supplier'. The minutes go on to observe that: ""Within the West Midlands region both West Midlands and Staffordshire Police have recently purchased and operated 4G compatible CCDC equipment. Both have purchased the same equipment from the company referred to in option 3"". The minutes indicate that the following decision was made: 'Both PCCs [West Mercia and Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioners] agreed to replacing the existing equipment with a new supplier'. [Name]... requests the following records: 1. Records relating to the purchase of ""existing"" CCDC equipment, referred to in the...minutes above including purchase orders, invoices, contracts, loan agreements, solicitation letters, correspondence with companies and other similar records. 2. Records relating to the purchase of replacement CCDC equipment referred to in the...minutes above, including purchase orders, invoices, contracts, loan agreements, solicitation letters, correspondence with companies and other similar records. 3. Records relating to the decision 'to replace the existing [CCDC] equipment equipment with a new supplier referred to in the...minutes above, including any records referred to or consulted in reaching that decision'. 4. "" 8. The fourth paragraph of the request is not relevant to this appeal, as it should have been addressed to a different public authority. The Information Commissioner commented in her Decision Notice that PCCW should have assisted Privacy International with making that request to the appropriate public authority. 9. In its initial response to the request in December 2016, PCCW stated that it held some information within the scope of parts 1-3 of the request but the information was exempt from disclosure under FOIA sections 24 (1) (national security) and 31 (1) (a) and (b) (prevention or detection of crime/apprehension or prosecution of offenders). It maintained that position following an internal review in May 2017. The Decision Notice 10. Privacy International complained to the Information Commissioner, whose office conducted an investigation. The Decision Notice dated 10 July 2018 records that PCCW had described the information it held as ""the business case regarding the replacement of existing CCDC equipment"", which was provided to the Information Commissioner in confidence. 311. The Decision Notice concluded that PCCW was entitled to rely on s.24 (1) FOIA in response to parts 1-3 of the information request and that the public interest did not favour disclosure. It did not therefore determine the engagement of s. 31 (1) FOIA. 12. The Decision Notice considered at paragraphs 21 to 34 the proper interpretation of s. 24 (1) FOIA and the meaning of the term ""required for the purpose of safeguarding national security"" with reference to case law. At paragraphs 35 to 39 of the Decision Notice, the arguments in favour of, and against, disclosure with reference to the public interest test under s.2 (2) (b) FOIA were considered. At paragraph 40, the Decision Notice concluded that there was ""some valid public interest in disclosure"" as it would increase public knowledge, but at paragraph 42 it was concluded that: ""The Commissioner considers it clearly to be the case that the public interest in disclosure does not match the weight of the public interest in safeguarding national security. This means that her conclusion is that the public interest in the maintenance of the exemption provided by s. 24 (1) outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the requested information"". Appeal to the Tribunal 13. Privacy International's Grounds of Appeal in respect of the PCCW Decision Notice may be summarised as follows. The Decision Notice is said to be wrong and/or unlawful because s. 24 (1) was not engaged by the particular information in dispute and, if it was, then the balance of public interest favoured disclosure. 14. The Information Commissioner's Response to the appeal may be summarised as follows. It was submitted that the Decision Notice was correct in its application of s. 24 (1) FOIA. However, the Commissioner also indicated that she anticipated supporting additional reliance by PCCW on s. 31 (1) FOIA. 15. PCCW's Response to the appeal may be summarised as follows. The Decision Notice was correct in relation to s. 24 (1) FOIA but PCCW also wished to rely on s. 31 (1) FOIA, which it had raised at an earlier stage but had not been determined by the Decision Notice. The Law 16. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 relevantly provides as follows: S. 1 (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled- (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. (2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to...section 2 ... S. 2 provides that: (2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1 (1) (b) does not apply if or to the extent that - (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in al/ the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 4S. 24(1) provides that: Information which does not fall within s. 23 (1) is exempt information if exemption from section 1 (1) (b) is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. S. 31 (1) provides that: Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice (a) The prevention or detection of crime, (b) The apprehension or prosecution of offenders"". 17. Both sections 24 (1) and 31 (1) are qualified exemptions and so engage the public interest balancing exercise under s. 2(2)(b) FOIA. 18. The Tribunal's role in determining an appeal against a Decision Notice is set out in s. 58 FOIA as follows: (1) If on an appeal under s. 57 the Tribunal considers (a) That the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) To the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, The Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner,' and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. Evidence 19. The Tribunal is grateful for their assistance to all of the witnesses in this appeal, some of whom gave evidence on paper only and others of whom attended to give evidence in person. We record here only the open evidence, as the closed evidence is considered in the closed annexe. 20. Privacy International relied on four witness statements, one of which was from Ulf Buermeyer, a Judge of the Regional Court of Berlin and the co-founder and President of the Society for Civil Rights known as GFF. His evidence referred to the publicly available information about IMSI catchers in Germany, and explained the framework under German law governing their use. In particular, he explained that the German system required notification to be given to a person whose data was caught by an IMSI catcher. He concluded that: ""As shown above, there is a high degree of transparency regarding the use of IMSI catchers in Germany, both at the individual and the institutional level. This includes individual notifications, public reporting mechanisms and information revealed in parliamentary questions. Important key figures have been published, including the specific bodies that have used IMSI catchers. This information has facilitated a public discussion, as evidenced by several news articles on the matter'.” 21. Privacy International also relied on a witness statement from Silke Holtmanns, who is a Security Expert and Distinguished Member of Technical Staff for Nokia, although her evidence was provided in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Nokia. She has an academic background and has published widely on the subject of mobile network and 5phone security. She explains what an IMSI catcher is, how it operates and its impact for mobile phone users, as follows: 11. An IMSI catcher, also called a 'stingray' or a 'false base station' is a small mobile base station. IMSI catchers vary in size, range, capabilities and price... 15. An IMSI catcher can act in either a passive mode or an active mode. The operator of the IMSI catcher chooses which mode to use. 16. In the passive mode an IMSI catcher checks which mobile towers are within its vicinity and it may, by tuning into a particular base station, intercept mobile phone data travelling between the phone and that base station. 17. In the active mode, the IMSI catcher acts as what is called a 'man-in-the- middle' 'in the communication path by presenting itself as a base station amid the mobile phone network. By presenting itself as a base station emitting the strongest signal, it entices mobile phones within its vicinity to connect to it and forces them to transmit date, in particular their IMSI and IMEI [International Mobile Equipment Identity]. 32. An IMSI catcher can be used to 'catch all' devices within its given vicinity, which is a common default setting when installing typical IMSI catcher software. 33. An IMSI catcher can also be used to target a particular mobile phone user, in which case you would need to know that particular user's IMSI. But even in this scenario, all other phones in the vicinity of the IMSI catcher would attempt to connect to it. When trying to connect to the IMSI catcher, these phones would transmit their IMSI and potentially IMEI data (depending on the network protocol used) which would be retained in the logs of the IMSI catcher. If properly configured, the IMSI catcher would reject the connection attempt by the phones of non-targeted users. But there remains a risk, dependent on the configurations of the IMSI catcher and the skill of the person configuring it, that the phones of non-target users will successfully connect to the IMSI catcher and have their communications and data compromised, in addition to being unable to make calls, including emergency calls. 43. There exist certain methods for detecting the use of IMSI catchers, for example by observing network anomalies or a strange handover between base stations. However, some of the signs that an IMSI catcher is in use may also be signs that a network is configured badly....So it is unclear how effective methods for detecting IMSI catchers are as it is not easy to differentiate between misconfigurations and IMSI catcher activities. "" 22. Privacy International also relied on a witness statement from Nathan Freed Wessler, who is a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's Privacy and Technology Project in New York. He describes his significant litigation experience in relation to surveillance technology and explains how American police forces have responded to Freedom of Information requests about the use of IMSI catchers. His evidence is that such responses have put a considerable amount of information into the public domain, for use in litigation and to inform public debate. 23. Privacy International also relied on a witness statement from Ailidh Callander, its inhouse legal officer. She describes the information in the public domain about the use of IMSI catchers in the UK, referring to press reports, information published by police forces themselves (such as the information referred to in the information request), and the 6technical information published by manufacturers of IMSI catchers. She exhibits material in each of these categories. 24. PCCW relied on open and closed witness statements made by Detective Superintendent Andrew Nolan of Warwickshire Police, who has been seconded into the West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit. In his open witness statement, DSU Nolan explained that the minutes of the meeting referred to by Privacy International in its information request had been inadvertently published in un-redacted form as a result of human error. When the error was realised, the minutes were removed from the website and a redacted version was later published. 25. DSU Nolan's witness statement described Ailidh Callander's witness statement as containing much speculation. He acknowledged that there is a certain amount of information about covert policing tactics available in the public domain, but expressed the view that further disclosure about equipment or tactics would have a significantly detrimental impact on policing and therefore the safety of the public within the UK. He also expressed the view, in line with national guidance on the subject, that some elements of organised crime directly impact national security. He refers to the National Crime Agency's annual threat assessment containing a finding that organised crime groups are increasingly run by younger, tech-savvy offenders, which he says underlines the importance of restricting public knowledge of any covert tactics or technologies which law enforcement agencies may use. He comments that: ""Within law enforcement across the country, the use of certain types of covert capabilities are only known about by a small number of people who work in dedicated teams and are appropriately vetted. "" 26. Turning to the particular withheld information in this case, DSU Nolan commented that: “...if the business case were to be disclosed, it would allow terrorists and criminal networks to build up a picture of different forces' abilities to respond to the activities of these groups and thus increase the threat to the public. ...it would seriously damage our fight against crime and terrorism should the information be made public."" 27. DSU Nolan described the oversight regime for the use of Targeted Interception and Targeted Equipment Interference, noting that at the time of the information request in this case it was governed by part 3 of the Police Act 1997 but that since September 2018 the relevant regime has been under part 5 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which involves judicial oversight. 28. In his oral evidence during the open session, DSU Nolan up-dated his witness statement to say that he has recently taken up post as Head of Intelligence for Warwickshire Police. 29. Cross-examined by Mr Knight on behalf of the Information Commissioner, he explained that the business case which has been withheld has more information in it than either the un-redacted minutes which had been published in error or the financial data contained within the redacted minutes. His witness statement had expressed the view that PCCW's relationship with other law enforcement agencies had been adversely affected by the inadvertent disclosure but in answer to Mr Knight he confirmed that this has not stopped anyone from doing their job. 30. PCCW also relied on the open and closed witness statements of Detective Superintendent Steve Williams, who is head of the Technical Surveillance Unit within the Metropolitan Police. His open witness statement included the following evidence: 7“4. ...Covert policing, by its nature, regularly works closely with and undertakes joint operations with the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and bodies covered by s. 23 FOIA .... 5. The fact that police use covert tactics to target criminality and terrorism is widely known. The exact detail and extent of law enforcement capabilities are not widely known .... 6. …Disclosure of our capabilities or tactics (or lack thereof) would seriously undermine future operations and place people's lives at risk. 9. Criminal networks and terrorists are actively trying to find out which covert tactics and their capabilities law enforcement utilise. The internet is scattered with pages and forums dedicated to people speculating on police tactics and the capabilities of law enforcement. Much of this information is guesswork, incorrect or based around what is seen in the 'movies'. Even when specific tactics are discussed, people are not aware of their capabilities, limitations, or true nature of how they are used. 10. In relation to covert technology utilised by police, maintaining secrecy is even more important. Technology changes rapidly and what could be done one day may be superseded or altered by the events of the near future. If criminals or terrorists know about the capabilities of covert technology, they will adjust their behaviour accordingly. 12. The ability to deploy these types of tactics not only supports the investigation and prosecution of criminals and terrorists but ultimately protects the lives of the communities that we serve. If we disclosed our tactics and capabilities, this would seriously damage our ability to respond to criminality and put in danger the lives of the communities that we are here to protect. "" Submissions 31. The Tribunal is grateful to all counsel for their helpful written and oral submissions. We record here the open submissions only, as the closed arguments are detailed in the closed annexe to this Decision. 32. Mr Bunting's skeleton argument dealt with the PCCW appeal briefly in submitting that neither the exemption at s. 24 (1) FOIA nor that at s. 31 (1) FOIA were engaged and that in either case, the public interest in maintaining the exemptions is ""obviously outweighed"" by the public interest in disclosing it. 33. In his oral submissions, Mr Bunting cautioned the Tribunal against automatic acceptance of the evidence of police officers and urged us to seek an objective evidential basis in support of their professional opinions. He submitted that PCCW had not demonstrated sufficiently in its open evidence that national security considerations would be impacted by the disclosure of the business case. He urged the Tribunal to ask itself what the business case tells us that is different to the information already in the public domain. In his submission it was unlikely that the business case would tell us the ""how, when and why"" of current usage or how the equipment might be used in the future. 34. In respect of the public interest balancing exercise, Mr Bunting submitted that Privacy International had made a strong case for disclosure. He referred us to Privacy International's witness evidence which, in his submission, demonstrated that there is 8already significant information in the public domain and that greater transparency, as demonstrated in the USA and Germany, had not been shown to impact negatively on national security or police operations. 35. Mr Bunting confirmed that he did not ask the Tribunal to rule on the adequacy of the legal safeguards as to the use of CCDC or IMSI catchers, but referred us to the public clamour for information about the technology, as shown by the press reports, questions asked in Parliament and the involvement of Privacy International as a privacy watchdog. He submitted that the greater the potential for arbitrary use of the technology, the greater the need for an informed public debate. 36. As to Privacy International's role, Mr Bunting submitted that the role of the requester is not irrelevant where it has a watchdog function and requests information in order to exercise its rights under Article 10 ECHR, referring us to the ECtHR judgment in Magyar Helsinki Bizottsag v Hungary (18030/11). 37. Mr Knight's skeleton argument on behalf of the Information Commissioner, acknowledged that PCCW was entitled to rely on s. 31 (1) FOIA before the Tribunal. He submitted that the ""would be likely to"" limb of s. 31 (1) was engaged by the open evidence before the Tribunal because it provided the Tribunal with a basis for concluding that disclosure of the information in the business case would inform serious criminals about a significant potential investigative technique and thus enable them to seek to avoid the application of it. 38. In relation to s. 24 (1) FOIA, Mr Knight submitted that the term ""national security"" has been interpreted broadly by the Tribunal and higher courts. Even where the likelihood of a particular harm to national security occurring may be assessed as low, the serious nature of the risk means that the public interest in avoiding it is strong. 39. Mr Knight submitted that, whilst not all crime would fall within the ambit of s. 24 (1), national security considerations should be understood to be engaged by serious organised crime. He submitted that the Tribunal should afford the evidence given by DSU Nolan and DSU Williams in this appeal respect, as their professional experience, understanding and judgement qualified them to make a predictive assessment as to the likely effect of disclosure. He described their evidence in this appeal as ""clear, cogent and common-sensical"". 40. Turning to the public interest balance, Mr Knight submitted that the Commissioner had accepted the weighty public interests in transparency, accountability and advancing public understanding in relation to the issues raised in this appeal and to the public interest in debating the issues, but had correctly favoured the public interest in avoiding a disclosure which was likely to undermine national security. In his submission, similar public interest considerations should be applied to the detection and prosecution of offenders. He referred the Tribunal to the Decision of the Upper Tribunal in Keane v Information Commissioner, Home Office and Metropolitan Police Service [2016] UKUT 461 (AAC), which concluded at [58] that: ""Whilst it may well be wise to avoid characterising particular exemptions as carrying 'inherent weight' ... the reality is that the public interest in maintaining the qualified national security exemption in section 24 (1) is likely to be substantial to require a compelling competing public interest to equal or outweigh it"" ... 41. In his oral submissions, Mr Knight accepted that there needed to be a public debate about CCDC and its potential to interfere with privacy rights, but submitted that this must be weighed against the public's right to live in peace and security and to be protected from harm by the state. 942. As to the position of Privacy International as a watchdog, Mr Knight's submission was that as a matter of precedent the Tribunal was bound to prefer the judgment of the Supreme Court in Kennedy v Charity Commission [2014] UKSC 20, that Article 10 ECHR did not encompass a right of access to state information. He noted that the Upper Tribunal is expected to rule shortly on this point. 43. Mr Ustych, on behalf of PCCW, supported Mr Knight's submissions. In relation to s. 24 (1) FOIA, he drew the Tribunal's attention to DSU Nolan's evidence that the term ""national security"" encompassed risks not only from terrorism but also from serious organised crime. In respect of s. 31 (1) FOIA, he drew the Tribunal's attention to DSU Nolan's evidence as to the increasingly 'tech-savvy' nature of offenders. 44. Commenting on Privacy International's submissions about the information already in the public domain, Mr Ustych submitted that the issue is more nuanced than Mr Bunting had suggested, because the degree of specificity, certainty and correctness of that information was relevant. The evidence from DSU Nolan was that Privacy International's evidence was speculative. This, in Mr Ustych's submission, undermined Privacy International's argument that a meaningful public debate could not take place without disclosure. 45. As to the public interest test, Mr Ustych submitted that in respect of both ss. 24 (1) and 31 (1) FOIA, the Tribunal must consider how serious the potential harm from disclosing the business case is. Even if the risk of harm were small, the severity of the consequence was, on the evidence, high. Mr Ustych submitted that Privacy International's evidence about transparency in America and Germany (a) did not purport to be a study of all jurisdictions where such technology was used and (b) was not given by witnesses with experience of law enforcement in this country. As to the domestic oversight regime, he referred the Tribunal to the recent judgment of the Divisional Court in R (National Council for Civil Liberties) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWHC 2057 (Admin) in which a Human Rights Act challenge to Part V of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 had been dismissed. 46. In his submissions in reply, Mr Bunting suggested for the first time that a redacted version of the business case might be disclosed. Neither Mr Knight nor Mr Ustych was able to support that proposal. Conclusion 47. Our conclusion in relation to s. 24(1) FOIA is that the exemption is engaged by the information requested in this case. We note that s. 24 is not a ""prejudice-based"" exemption and that the word ""required"" has been interpreted as meaning ""reasonably necessary"" in other First-tier Tribunal Decisions. While these do not bind us, we also adopt this formulation, which seems to us to accord with a plain reading of the statutory provision. 48. We accept Mr Knight's submission that the term ""national security"" should be understood to encompass threats from terrorism and also from serious organised crime. The open evidence from DSU Williams and DSU Nolan supported such an approach, and their closed evidence gave us greater detail. They explained in their open evidence that ""safeguarding"" national security involved protecting the public from all such threats and saving lives. 49. We have adopted Mr Bunting's sensible approach of asking ourselves what the business case tells us that is different to the information already in the public domain. In undertaking this exercise, we have found it difficult to assess the reliability of the 10considerable body of evidence relied on by Privacy International as being ""information in the public domain"". We are unable to go so far as DSU Nolan who described it as speculative, but we do note that the press reports cite either un-named police sources or quotes from former officers alongside official responses which clearly neither confirm nor deny the use of IMSI catchers (exhibits AC1/1, AC1/2 and AC1/3). We also note that the Sky News report referred to by Ailidh Callander at paragraph 9 of her witness statement apparently relied on the use of technology to detect IMSI catchers, whilst Silke Holtmanns' evidence (see paragraph 21 above) was that such methods of detection were unreliable. We conclude, as DSU Williams stated, that even when specific tactics are discussed, people are not aware of their capabilities, limitations, or the true nature of how they are used. We have assessed the information in the business case itself in the light of this conclusion and find that it does tell us things that are different to what is in the public domain via both the minutes disclosed in error and generally. 50. We accept the evidence of both police witnesses that the business case should be regarded as exempt from disclosure for the purpose of safeguarding national security. We do not accept their evidence uncritically, but have done so having considered their long experience of policing and the specialist roles they both now hold, which gives them knowledge of matters known to very few people. We have also had regard to the evidence given in closed session which supports the views they have expressed in their open witness statements. 51. We are accordingly satisfied that the information contained in the business case, which is different to the information in the public domain, engages the exemption for the purpose of safeguarding national security. We consider the public interest balancing exercise in relation to the engagement of s. 24 (1) FOIA below. 52. Our conclusion in relation to s. 31 (1) (a) and (b) is that the exemption is engaged by the information withheld in this case. Both DSU Williams and DSU Nolan gave open evidence about the likely prejudice to the prevention or detection of crime and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders if the business case were disclosed. For the reasons given above, we find their evidence on this point reliable with reference to their experience of policing serious organised crime and their evidence about the use to which information of the sort contained in the business case would be put by offenders. We rely also on the evidence given in their closed witness statements and testimony. We conclude, on the basis of their evidence, that the ""would be likely to"" prejudice test is met. 53. In assessing the public interest balancing exercise in relation to both of the exemptions which we have found to be engaged by the withheld material, we remind ourselves that there is no inherent weight in a qualified exemption under FOIA. We also remind ourselves of the Upper Tribunal's analysis in Keane and its approach in relation to s. 24 (1) FOIA of looking for a compelling public interest in disclosure to equal or displace the compelling public interest in the safeguarding of national security. We apply the same approach to the public interest in detecting crime and bringing offenders to justice. 54. We acknowledge, as did the Information Commissioner in the Decision Notice, the weighty public interest in transparency about how public funds are spent, and in promoting informed public discourse about the potential for CCDC equipment, particularly IMSI catchers, to infringe individual privacy rights. We also acknowledge the leading role that third sector bodies such as Privacy International play in such discourse. However, we do not accept that the public interest in disclosure is enhanced by the status of the requester under FOIA. We regard the ""applicant blind"" approach taken by this Tribunal over many years as fundamentally important to the protection of the right to information requested by ordinary citizens. We are not persuaded that the ECtHR's 11judgment in Magyar disturbs that approach as we are bound as a matter of precedent to rely on the domestic authority of Kennedy, cited above. 55. Having balanced those considerations with reference to the open and closed evidence, we conclude that the public interest favours maintaining both the exemptions in this case. We accept the open evidence of DSU Williams and DSU Nolan that lives would be put in danger by the disclosure (including via a 'mosaic effect') of the information contained in the business case because if criminals or terrorists knew about the capabilities of covert technology, they would adjust their behaviour accordingly. We conclude that the acknowledged public interest in disclosure does not outweigh such a weighty case for non-disclosure. 56. We do not consider that a redacted business case could be disclosed because the extent of the redactions necessary to give effect to our Decision would render the information disclosed useless. 57. For the reasons given above, we now uphold the Decision Notice and dismiss this appeal.

"13","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0304 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Dr Malcolm Clarke Ms Marion Saunders Determined, by consent, on written evidence and submissions. Considered on the papers on 17 March 2020 Between Peter Shaw Appellant -and- (1) The Information Commissioner (2) Arts Council England Respondents DECISION AND REASONS DECISION 1. The appeal is dismissed. 1MODE OF HEARING 2. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 Chamber’s Procedure Rules. 3. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising pages 1 to 365. INTRODUCTION 4. The Appellant has concerns about the authorship painting of Charles Edward Stuart (‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’) which has been accepted into Public Ownership ‘in lieu’ of inheritance tax. The Appellant has pursued this matter with various bodies for some time. For the immediate purposes of this case, the Appellant made two requests for information from Arts Council England (ACE) about a draft letter and Acceptance in Lieu Panel (AILP) recommendations and correspondence. 5. In relation to ‘Request 1’ the Appellant continued previous correspondence with ACE that had begun in February 2017, and on 6 May 2018 requested information in the following terms: [Part 1]. “Could you kindly inform me whether all the Panel members agreed the letter prior to its issue. They are likely to have done so at a minuted meeting or in an email circulated among the Panel. I do not seek the specific details at present, only the information. [Part 2] May I infer from your answer that the AILP or Arts Council have no knowledge of an AILP recommendation ever having been rejected by the Secretary of State or a minister of the devolved nations? (I did ask whether you were aware of such a recommendation ever having been rejected).” 26. To explain the context, this request relates to an earlier, and similar, request made by the Appellant on 23 March 2018. In its response to that request, ACE had released the names of the members of the AILP, advised that no AILP recommendations had been rejected in the previous five years and advised when the last AILP rejection had been. 7. In relation to Request 2, on 8 June 2018 the Appellant made the following request for information: “…all the information, to which I am entitled, that the AILP has generated as a result of my emails related to the subject of the AILP decision to recommend the acquisition of the oil painting by Allan Ramsay of Bonnie Prince Charlie”. 8. Initially, ACE declined to process the Appellant’s Request 1 under FOIA. However, following investigation by the Commissioner, ACE provided a response to Request 1 on 25 April 2019. The Commissioner explained in the decision notice dated 15 August 2019 that: - It released information it holds that falls within the scope of part [1]. With regard to part [2] ACE confirmed that in 2014 and in 2018 there was a rejection of two AILP recommendations for the acceptance of two cultural gifts; and that in the early 1990s the AILP process was subject to long term delays. ACE confirmed that it holds files going back to January 1993 but that it would take over 18 hours to go through these files to provide an answer to part [2]. ACE suggested how the complainant might refine his request to bring complying with it within the time and cost limit. 9. In relation to Request 2 ACE provided a response on 14 June 2018, refusing the request, saying that it was carrying out a review of the Appellant’s previous requests on the topic of the AILP decision with regard to the painting and that the current request did not appear to ask for anything that had not been covered previously. 10. However, during the Commissioner’s investigation, on 2 May 2019 ACE then relied on section 14(1) FOIA (vexatious request) to refuse to comply with Request 2. 311. In relation to the scope of the case investigated by the Commissioner, she explained that: - 18. The Commissioner’s investigation has focussed on …. whether [ACE] has complied with section 1 of the FOIA with regard to part [1] of request 1; whether it can rely on section 12(1) to refuse to fully comply with part [2] of request 1 and whether it can rely on section 14(1) to refuse to comply with request 2. 19. The Commissioner has finally considered whether ACE complied with its duty under section 16(1) with regard to part [2] of request 1 and its duties under section 10(1) and 17(5) with regard to both requests. 12. In relation to Part 1 of Request 1, the Commissioner explains the background as follows- 23. …. the Acceptance in Lieu scheme enables taxpayers to transfer important works of art and heritage objects into public ownership while paying Inheritance Tax (or one of its earlier forms). The AILP advises Ministers on all items offered under the scheme and on the allocation of objects. The Commissioner understands that the painting of Charles Edward Stuart (‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’) in question was acquired by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme. The complainant has concerns about the authorship and valuation of the above painting and a possible associated fraud that he had identified. 24. ACE has explained that on 12 July 2017 the complainant had sent an email to the AILP inbox with a letter addressed to the AILP chairman reporting his latest research into the commissioning letter for the Ramsay Portrait. His letter also requested an “independent review, commissioned confidentially by the panel”. ACE says a response to this letter was drafted and circulated to the AILP members for its information. The letter (i.e. the letter to which the complainant refers in his request) was then sent to the complainant by email from the AILP mailbox on 2 August 2017. 25. In an initial submission to the Commissioner on 15 March 2019, ACE referred to an email it had sent to the complainant on 23 April 2018 (i.e. prior to request 1 being submitted on 6 May 2018). In that email, a copy of which ACE provided to the Commissioner, ACE had released a list of the names of the individual Panel members who saw and agreed the letter in question. ACE told the 4Commissioner that the list included the names of all of the 2017 AILP members, as shown on ACE’s website. 13. Thus, Part 1 of Request 1 was for confirmation that all AILP members agreed to the letter sent on 2 August 2017, before that letter was issued and, in his request, the Appellant said that he was seeking only the information, not the “specific details”. The Commissioner said that ACE had provided the following material: - • An extract from the 22 June 2017 meeting minutes in which it is confirmed that the Chairman would draft the letter. • A ‘Matters arising’ item from the 20 July 2017 AILP meeting relating to the AILP meeting of June 2017 which refers to the Chairman’s draft response to the complainant’s letter being attached (i.e. circulated). • An email from the AILP secretariat to the AILP members dated 26 July 2017 circulating the Chairman’s draft letter and asking for comment. • Emails from some Panel members commenting on the draft letter. • The covering email from the ‘AIL Panel’ to the complainant, dated 2 August 2017, attaching the final letter. 14. The conclusion of the Commissioner in relation to Part 1 of Request 1 was that it was ‘a reasonable interpretation of the recorded information ACE has released’ that the content of the AILP Chairman’s letter sent to the Appellant on 2 August 2017 had been agreed by the whole Panel, and that therefore ACE had complied with the requirement to make requested information available. 15. Part 2 of Request 1 is for confirmation that neither the AILP nor ACE had any knowledge of an AILP recommendation “ever” having been rejected by the Secretary of State or a Minister of the devolved nations. 516. In its final response to the complainant of 25 April 2019, ACE confirmed that in 2014 and in 2018 there was a rejection of two AILP recommendations for the acceptance of two cultural gifts; and that in the early 1990s the AILP process was subject to long term delays. ACE had confirmed that it holds relevant files going back to January 1993 but explained the difficulties it would face retrieving the information. The Commissioner explains as follows: - 35. In a submission to the Commissioner on 2 August 2019, ACE advised that it has compiled a list of all relevant ‘Acceptance in Lieu’ boxes held at its offsite storage facility…. The list comprises 192 boxes, which each hold numbers of case files….. ACE says that in order to provide a response to part [2] it would need to review the contents of all the AILP papers. 36. ACE has explained that not all of its records record how many case files there are per box, but that usually there are 5-10 case files per box (so 7 on average). 192 boxes at 7 files per box equates to 1,344 individual case files, which would all need to be reviewed manually. Each file will contain on average about 100 pages including the ‘offer’ papers. ACE advises that some case files have significantly more pages, especially where the offer relates to a collection or an archive. 37. ACE notes that there are 1,080 minutes in 18 hours. That being the case, ACE says it would mean that it could only spend 1.08 minute on each file, if it is to get through all the case files in 18 hours. This work would include recalling the files and returning them to the storage facility; unpacking them etc. ACE says that the time it would take to recall the files alone is more than 1.08 minute. It would need at least 10 minutes per file (10 x 1000 = 10,000 minutes/166 hours) – by which the Commissioner understands that ACE means 10 minutes to review each file - and five minutes to recall each box (192 x 5 = 960 minutes/16 hours). ACE has confirmed that the amount of time it would take to comply with part [2] would therefore be in excess of the 18 hours provided under section 12(1). ACE has also noted that there are also costs associated with box retrieval from its storage facility, which would likely be above the cost threshold of the £450 provided under section 12(1). 17. The Commissioner concluded that she found ACE’s explanation for why it would exceed the time limit to comply with this part to be reasonable 6and credible, and decided that ACE could rely on section 12(1) FOIA to refuse to comply with Part 2 of Request 1. 18. The Commissioner found that ACE had complied with the requirement to provide advice and assistance to help the Appellant refine the request so that it can be dealt with under the appropriate limit, by suggesting to the Appellant that he limit his request to the previous 10 years rather than ‘ever’, but he declined to do this. 19. Request 2 was for: “…all the information, to which I am entitled, that the AILP has generated as a result of my emails related to the subject of the AILP decision to recommend the acquisition of the oil painting by Allan Ramsay of Bonnie Prince Charlie.”. The Commissioner explains the Appellant’s position as follows: - 48. The complainant clarified for the Commissioner that in response to this request he was expecting that he would receive copies of emails and/or reports, redacted where appropriate, that had resulted from his correspondence with the AILP and ACE. 49. The complainant says he was particularly keen to receive information relating to the involvement of the Audit Committee and Internal Audit regarding his submissions. He says that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had also informed him that ACE staff had looked into the possible fraud issues he had raised and the complainant says he was keen to establish who, or which department, examined the matter; when it was examined and whether a report was produced and, if so, who received it. 50. By way of a final example, the complainant says he also wished to know who received a copy of his ‘January 2018 report’ as it appeared to him that there was some confusion about whether members of the AILP received the information or whether the Chair, Chief Executive or the Audit Committee did so. 20. Having considered ACE’s submissions on why Request 2 should be considered vexatious for the purposes of section 14(1) FOIA, including 7that it would take 30 hours to compile the information requested, the Commissioner reached a conclusion that is worth setting out at length: - 61. The Commissioner notes that at the point of the request, the complainant had been corresponding with ACE about a particular AILP decision for approximately 15 months. ACE had therefore already devoted significant time and resources to addressing the complainant’s queries and requests but it had borne that burden. As a result, the complainant has been provided with a considerable amount of information concerning the subject that is of interest to him – an AILP decision about a particular painting. The complainant has told the Commissioner that he also received “a considerable volume” of associated information from the National Audit Office and DCMS to whom he had also submitted FOI requests. 62. The Commissioner considers that the 30 hours plus that ACE has estimated it would take to comply with the request is a reasonable estimate given the number of pages involved and because any potentially exempt information would be spread throughout this material and would not be straightforward to locate. The complainant’s submissions to the Commissioner explain, to a degree, why he is seeking the particular information requested in request 2 i.e. why it is of interest to him. He has not, however, made a case for the information being of any wider public interest. If the requested information had a wider public interest, this might justify the impact on ACE that complying with the request would cause. 63. The complainant says he is seeking information on the involvement of ACE’s audit committee, internal audit and DCMS – with regard to the latter who, or which, department examined concerns about the fraud the complainant says he identified; when these concerns were examined, whether a report was produced and, if so, who received it. 64. In the Commissioner’s view, these questions are incidental to the central issue, which was whether a fraud had been committed. ACE has confirmed to the Commissioner that it understands that the complainant does not believe that the painting in question is of Bonnie Prince Charlie, nor that it was painted by Allan Ramsay; by implication he considers that the painting was not worth the amount that was paid for it. However, ACE says that its audit team, DCMS and the National Audit Office have all considered the complainant’s concerns and have advised the complainant that 8they were satisfied with the way the offer for the painting had been assessed, and that the complainant’s concerns regarding fraud were unfounded. 65. From the information provided to the Commissioner it appears that the complainant’s concerns have been independently considered by three bodies and that that particular matter is concluded, albeit not to the complainant’s satisfaction. ACE’s audit team and DCMS have advised the complainant that they do not consider a fraud to have taken place. 66. …For these reasons the Commissioner is satisfied that ACE can categorise request 2 as vexatious under section 14(1) as complying with it would cause a burden to ACE that is disproportionate to the request’s value. THE APPEAL 21. The Appellant filed an appeal dated 29 August 2019. His appeal is a lengthy and discursive document and ranges over many matters concerning the way the Commissioner and ACE have dealt with his request and correspondence. 22. Many of the issues discussed are out with the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. The appeal grounds have been amended and expanded in response to the responses from the Commissioner and ACE. 23. In relation to Part 1 of Request 1, the Appellant disputes the Commissioner’s finding that ACE has satisfied her that all members of the AILP agreed the relevant letter referred to in Part 1. The Appellant does not appear to challenge the information provided by ACE upon which that conclusion is based (as set out in paragraph 9 above), or that there is more information to be disclosed but does dispute the conclusion itself. 24. In relation to Part 2 of Request 1, the Appellant queries the amount of time ACE have stated it will take to retrieve the information. He thinks that the rejection of an AILP recommendation would be so unusual that a record 9of it would be easily found. He also now argues that what he wants is an answer to his question based on the current knowledge available, and not the actual information as to whether there has, in fact, ever been a rejection. 25. In relation to Request 2, the Appellant disagrees with the ‘burden’ that ACE states would be placed on it responding to the request such that the request could be considered vexatious and emphasises what he sees as the public interest in the information he has sought being disclosed. He says the Commissioner was wrong to say that the concerns about fraud had been considered by three different bodies. In the latest version of his submissions the Appellant states that he would be satisfied with valuation and authorship reports in relation to the painting he is interested in, redacted as appropriate. 26. Referring to Part 1 of Request 1, the Commissioner responds that she accepts that it cannot be gleaned from the documents disclosed by ACE that all the members of the AIPL agreed the letter prior to its release, but that ACE had also responded to say that ‘we can confirm’ that all AILP members agreed the letter, and that this confirmation together with the disclosed documents were sufficient to satisfy the ACE disclosure duty under s1 of FOIA. 27. For Part 2 of Request 1, the Commissioner reiterates her acceptance that ACE would have needed to review records back to 1993, and that viewed objectively the request was for the information that might be gleaned from available records, and not the present knowledge as to what might or might not have happened since 1993. 28. In respect of Request 2, the Commissioner comments that there is no dispute that the Appellant’s concerns have been relayed to various public bodies, but that none have identified any concerns as to fraud in relation 10to the painting. As a result, the Commissioner identifies little public interest in relation to Request 2. The Commissioner accepts that the burden claimed by ACE in those circumstances is such as to make the request vexatious. 29. ACE has also submitted a response which concentrates on the vexatiousness issue. We note that ACE gives more detail about the burden on the organisation of responding to Request 2, which would amount to preparing 600 pages for disclosure, including consideration of possible exemptions which might apply to some of the information. ACE also provides details of the cumulative burden of responding to the Appellant on the same issue (the authenticity of the painting) for a period from February 2017 to the date of the present request, including five previous FOIA requests, and submission of draft reports from the Appellant, as well as other correspondence. ACE submissions state that ‘As every response generated a new request or a new avenue of correspondence, the task of dealing with the Appellant became increasingly frustrating’. 30. ACE accept that the Appellant was ‘originally motivated by genuine desire to access information, and that the underlying subject matter is of considerable public interest’. However, ACE argue that Request 2 (for all information generated by his own emails) represents ‘vexatiousness by drift’ as described in the UT case of Dransfield at paragraph 38 (see below), as it is one step removed from his original concerns, 31. ACE point out that the Appellant can continue to pursue his theories about the painting, to publish his articles and ‘have these weighed in the academic market-place of ideas’. He can present any evidence of fraud to the appropriate authorities. DISCUSSION AND DECISION 11Part 1 of Request 1 32. In our view ACE has disclosed the information it has to show that the decision that was made in relation to the relevant letter was agreed by the members of the AILP. The Appellant has the confirmation that all AIPL members agreed the letter and he also has the information as to what occurred before the letter was sent (see above paragraph 9). In our view there is nothing else for ACE to disclose to satisfy their duties to disclose information in relation to this request. We agree with the Commissioner that the information disclosed is sufficient to meet ACE’s duties under s1(1) FOIA to make available information requested. Part 2 of Request 1 33. Section 12(1) FOIA says that a public authority is not obliged to comply with a request if the authority estimates it would exceed the appropriate cost limit to do so. The appropriate limit is currently £450 for public authorities other than government departments. Public authorities can charge a maximum of £25 per hour to undertake work to comply with a request which corresponds to the £450 threshold cited by ACE. 34. Where a public authority claims that section 12(1) FOIA is engaged it should, where reasonable, provide advice and assistance to help an applicant refine the request so that it can be dealt with under the appropriate limit, in line with section 16(1) FOIA. 35. We accept the evidence of ACE about the amount of time it would take to respond to this part of the request. Essentially, the request requires ACE to retrieve and search records going back a quarter of a century to ascertain whether it holds material. Even if that initially involves tracking 12down minutes of meetings since 1993, it is understandable that that will take ACE over the statutory limit for responding as described above in the decision notice. 36. We agree with the Commissioner and ACE that the Appellant’s recent claim that all he wants is an explanation as to what is currently known about previous rejections if AILP recommendations, rather than the actual information held, is not reflected in an objective reading of his request. A request for current understanding or beliefs held by ACE would also not amount to a request for information under FOIA. Request 2 37. Section 14(1) FOIA states that “Section 1(1) [FOIA] does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious”. Vexatiousness is not defined in section 14 FOIA, but it is immediately noticeable that it is the request that must be vexatious and not the person making the request. 38. The approach to vexatiousness is set out in the case of Information Commissioner vs Devon County Council & Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC). There is an emphasis on protecting public authorities’ resources from unreasonable requests which is described by the Upper Tribunal in Dransfield when it defined the purpose of section 14 as follows at paragraph 10: ‘Section 14…is concerned with the nature of the request and has the effect of disapplying the citizen’s right under Section 1(1) …The purpose of Section 14…must be to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA…’ (paragraph 10). 1339. Also in Dransfield, the Upper Tribunal took the view that the ordinary dictionary definition of the word vexatious is only of limited use, because the question as to whether a request is vexatious ultimately depends upon the circumstances surrounding that request. As the Upper Tribunal observed: ‘There is…no magic formula – all the circumstances need to be considered in reaching what is ultimately a value judgement as to whether the request in issue is vexatious in the sense of being a disproportionate, manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA’. 40. One aspect of the consideration was whether the request had inherent value. As the UT said at paragraph 38: - 41. …Does the request have a value or serious purpose in terms of the objective public interest in the information sought? In some cases, the value or serious purpose will be obvious – say a relative has died in an institutional setting in unexplained circumstances, and a family member makes a request for a particular internal policy document or good practice guide. On the other hand, the weight to be attached to that value or serious purpose may diminish over time. For example, if it is truly the case that the underlying grievance has been exhaustively considered and addressed, then subsequent requests (especially where there is “vexatiousness by drift”) may not have a continuing justification. …Of course, a lack of apparent objective value cannot alone provide a basis for refusal under section 14, unless there are other factors present which raise the question of vexatiousness. In any case, given that the legislative policy is one of openness, public authorities should be wary of jumping to conclusions about there being a lack of any value or serious purpose behind a request simply because it is not immediately self-evident. 42. Dransfield was also considered in the Court of Appeal (Dransfield v Information Commissioner and Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454) where Arden LJ observed at paragraph 68 that: - 14“…the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public… The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious.’ 43. Specific reference should also be made to paragraph 72 of Dransfield in the Court of Appeal where Arden LJ addressed paragraph 10 of the UT decision and said: - 72 Before I leave this appeal I note that the UT held [2012] UKUT 440 AAC at [10] that the purpose of section 14 was “to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA”. For my own part, I would wish to qualify that aim as one only to be realised if the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied. This is one of the respects in which the public interest and the individual rights conferred by FOIA have, as Lord Sumption JSC indicated in Kennedy v Charity Commission (Secretary of State for Justice and others intervening [2015] AC 455 para 2 above), been carefully calibrated. 44. The recent Upper Tribunal case of Cabinet Office v Information Commissioner v Ashton [2018] UKUT 208 (AAC) made clear that s14(1) FOIA can apply on the basis of the burden placed on the public authority, even where there was a public interest in the request being addressed and where there was a ‘reasonable foundation’ for the request: - 27. The law is thus absolutely clear. The application of section 14 of FOIA requires a holistic assessment of all the circumstances. Section 14 may be invoked on the grounds of resources alone to show that a request is vexatious. A substantial public interest underlying the request for information does not necessarily trump a resources argument. As Mr Armitage put it in the Commissioner’s written response to the appeal (at §18): 15a. In deciding whether a request is vexatious within the meaning of section 14(1), the public authority must consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. b. The burden which compliance with the request will impose on the resources of a public authority is a relevant consideration in such an assessment. c. In some cases, the burden of complying with the request will be sufficient, in itself, to justify characterising that request as vexatious, and such a conclusion is not precluded if there is a clear public interest in the information requested. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious. 45. The Commissioner has identified a number of ‘indicators’ which may be useful in identifying vexatious requests. These are set out in her published guidance and, in short, they include: • Abusive or aggressive language • Burden on the authority – the guidance allows for public authorities to claim redaction as part of the burden • Personal grudges • Unreasonable persistence • Unfounded accusations • Intransigence • Frequent or overlapping requests • Deliberate intention to cause annoyance. 46. As the Commissioner says, the fact that a request contains one or more of these indicators will not necessarily mean that it must be vexatious. All the circumstances of a case will need to be considered in reaching a judgement as to whether a request is vexatious. 47. Taking a holistic view of this request, it comes in the context of the Appellant raising what it is accepted was a serious issue about the authenticity of a painting accepted in lieu of tax on behalf of the State. However, what is clear from the documents we have seen, is that ACE and the other public authorities contacted by the Appellant have not agreed with him on this issue and have declined to carry out the investigation 16that the Appellant believes is necessary. It is palpable from the documents in this case that this has caused the Appellant immense frustration. This has then manifested itself in a series of further requests for information which have culminated in Request 2 – a request ‘all the information … that the AILP has generated as a result of my emails related to the subject of the AILP decision.’ Thus, the focus of the Appellant’s concerns has moved from the issue of authenticity of the painting, to the way that AILP has dealt with the Appellant’s correspondence on the issue. 48. We bear in mind the chronology of correspondence and FOIA requests provided by ACE in its Response (referred to above) over a fifteen-month period, and agree with ACE’s assessment that each response by ACE simply leads to a new request by the Appellant. In some circumstances such persistence might be proportionate and appropriate, but in this case, it is now clear the AILP and ACE are not going to take the action that the Appellant wants them to take. 49. In our view this is the kind of case referred to by the UT at paragraph 38 of Dransfield where “…the weight to be attached to th[e] value or serious purpose may diminish over time’. It is a case where ‘…the underlying grievance has been exhaustively considered and addressed’ and where ‘subsequent requests (especially where there is “vexatiousness by drift”) may not have a continuing justification’. This is a case where, in our view, there is indeed ‘vexatiousness by drift’, as the Appellant moves from his original concern to the way his correspondence has been dealt with. In our view there is little public interest in this secondary issue. 50. It is against this background that we also consider the arguments that Request 2 imposes a disproportionate burden on the public authority. The burden which compliance with the request will impose on the resources of ACE is a relevant consideration in our holistic assessment of the request. We accept that there would be a considerable burden in collating the 17information to be disclosed for the purposes of Request 2 as explained in the passages of the decision notice set out above, and we also take into account that the Appellant’s requests and correspondence have already become burdensome to ACE over a period of time. 51. Taking all these factors into account and bearing in mind the consideration in Dransfield and the points set out in the Commissioner’s guidance we find: - (a) Even though the underlying issue of the painting is an important one, Request 2 as framed has little public interest and is subsidiary to the main concerns about the painting he has sought to explore. (b) The request in itself is burdensome and would add to the burdensomeness already imposed on ACE. (c) The Appellant has demonstrated (a) unreasonable persistence; (b) intransigence; and (c) has made frequent or overlapping requests over a period of time. 52. On that basis we agree with the Commissioner that Request 2 is vexatious for the purposes of s14(1) FOIA. 53. We recognise that the Appellant has recently said that he would be content to receive just two redacted reports. However, this is not the request considered by ACE or the Commissioner, and therefore not a matter which we can take into account in an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice. 54. Finally, we also consider briefly the Appellant’s additional point that the Commissioner failed to consider a third request, made in identical terms 18to Request 2, save that it sought information that ACE (rather than AILP) had generated as a result of the Appellant’s emails on the subject of AILP’s recommendation. We agree with the Commissioner that (a) as the AILP is an ACE panel, the former request is effectively a subset of the information covered by the second and (b) in any event, as ACE responds to FOI requests made to AILP, both requests were made to ACE. 55. If, as we have found, Request 2 is vexatious in relation to the information generated by AILP, the same would inevitably be true about information generated by the identical request in relation to ACE, and we so conclude. CONCLUSION 56. For those reasons, we dismiss this appeal. Stephen Cragg QC Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 9th April 2020. 19"

Dated this 6th day of June 2011 Robin Callender Smith Judge -4-IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2011/0009 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS REASONS FOR DECISION Request for Information 1. On 7 February 2010 the Appellant asked the Additional Party – Mid Sussex District Council – for information in respect of certain planning consents under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Countryside Rights of Way Act 2000. 2. The requests were as follows: (1) CD/06/02564/FUL In relation to that consent, information relating to or in connection with: <U+F0B7> Visit to the land by MSDC officials and their agents at any time; <U+F0B7> Satisfaction or failure to satisfy conditions under the grant of permission notice, dated 17 January 2007; <U+F0B7> Agricultural need for development. (2) CD/06/01828/FUL In relation to that consent, information relating to or in connection with: <U+F0B7> Visits to the land by MSDC officials and their agents at any time; <U+F0B7> Agricultural need the development. (3) CD/00/00054/FUL In relation to that consent, information relating to or in connection with: <U+F0B7> Visits to the land by MSDC officials and their agents at any time; <U+F0B7> satisfaction or failure to satisfy conditions under the grant of permission notice, dated 9 June 2000; <U+F0B7> Agricultural need for development. For the purposes of the above, references to Parkgate Farm, Sunrise Farm, land at Cleavers Lane, land to the west of Cleavers Lane, land at the junction of the B2115 and Cleavers Lane or combinations of the above descriptions will be taken to be synonymous with the above application/consent references. -5-(4) Green Portakabin, currently located on land at junction of B2115 and Cleavers Lane to its west. All information relating to the above, to the extent not disclosed pursuant to the information already requested elsewhere in this letter. For the purpose of this request, information shall include, but not be limited to: <U+F0B7> Type of information: includes all media, such as paper, electronic and micro-fiche; <U+F0B7> Source of information: includes that generated by MSDC or received from or generated by all third parties; <U+F0B7> Form of information: includes all records such as letters, memos, briefs, file notes (of meetings, telephone conversations or otherwise), e-mails, scanned documents, recommendations, forms (compliance application or like) and photos. 3. On 19 February 2010 MSDC stated that the only information it held in relation to the planning applications in question that it had not already disclosed was held on its enforcement files. The MSDC refused to disclose that information on the ground that it was exempt under sections 40 and 41 FOIA. On 20 February 2010 the Appellant requested an internal review. The MSDC provided some information in a letter dated 1 March 2010 at the Appellant considered that response was incomplete. 4. There was an internal review and the MSDC informed the Appellant, in a letter dated 16 March 2010, that it had previously disclosed all the information it held relating to the planning applications in question with the exception of information held in its enforcement files. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner about that refusal on 29 March 2010. 5. During the course of the Commissioners investigation MSDC informed him that, given the passage of time, it was no longer seeking to resist the disclosure of the information it had previously withheld from the appellant. MSDC wrote to the appellant on 4 August 2010 disclosing the information that had previously been withheld. That did not include electromagnetic copies of photographs that had been requested. The MSDC qualified the extent of the disclosures on the basis of relevance and the material might be subject to copyright. -6-The complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. The Appellant did not consider the MSDC had provided him with all the information he had requested and continued with his appeal to the Information Commissioner who issued a decision notice dated 21 December 2010. 7. In that Decision Notice the Commissioner considered whether the MSDC held any further information that had not been disclosed to the Appellant and concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, there was no further relevant information held by MSDC within the scope of the Appellant's request that had not already been disclosed to him. 8. The Appellant appealed against the Decision notice on 19 January 2011 The appeal to the Tribunal 9. By the time the matter came before the Tribunal – following a stay of the appeal to see whether the Appellant and the MSDC could reach agreement on what was disclosable and what had been disclosed – some of the issues set out in the Appellant’s grounds of appeal had been resolved. 10. The Appellant had complained that within the documents disclosed to him by MSDC a particular e-mail was partially disclosed. A complete version of that had now been provided to him and was no longer an issue. 11. The Appellant complained that MSDC had not disclosed copies of all the photographs that it held. MSDC's assurance that all ""relevant"" photographs had been disclosed was a qualified assurance and the Commissioner should have obtained an ""unqualified"" assurance given the context of the appeal. The Appellant contended that the Commissioner should have invited the MSDC either to confirm that ""all related or connected information"" had been disclosed or – if not – to have required that all such information be disclosed. 12. The Appellant believed that the Commissioner should have requested the MSDC to disclose any further information that had been withheld because of concerns over copyright infringement or alternatively to have provided non-qualified confirmation that all photographs had been disclosed. The questions for the Tribunal 13. Whether, on the balance of probabilities, there was metadata in relation to the dates on which particular site photographs had been taken which had not been disclosed to the Appellant. -7-14. Whether the Commissioner should have used more rigorous language – in terms of relevant documents and data – in requiring MSDC to disclose the information that had been disclosed. Evidence 15. Mr Conway, in his evidence, concentrated in particular on the metadata in relation to whether photographs could or could not been taken before 17 January 2010. 16. His observations of the site led him to believe that work had not reached the level suggested by a cut-off date of 17 January 2010 – in respect of photographs – and that the work on the site must have happened later. 17. That date is relevant because it is the date the planning consent in relation to the site lapsed. MSDC said that the work had started before 17 January 2010 but he believed that the metadata in respect of the photographic material in question would show work at a later date. Conclusion and remedy 22. The Tribunal, having considered all the written and oral evidence, concluded that the Commissioner’s decision in relation to the language used in respect of ""relevant"" information was appropriate and proper. It did not agree with the Appellant that more rigorous language should have been used. 23. The Tribunal, having heard the detailed and credible evidence offered by the Appellant in respect of his opinion that metadata and information in relation to the photographic material at issue concluded that it should indeed have been disclosed to him so that the more precise dates could be attributed to the photographs at issue. -8-24. To that extent the Appellant’s appeal succeeds and this information should be disclosed to him as detailed in the Substituted Decision Notice. The Tribunal's view is that it should already have been disclosed to him and, if it had been, the appeal itself might have been more quickly resolved and decided in the light of the other information that had actually been disclosed by MSDC. 25. There is no order as to costs. 26. Our decision is unanimous. 27. Although this appeal started as an appeal to the Information Tribunal, by virtue of The Transfer of Tribunal Functions Order 2010 (and in particular articles 2 and 3 and paragraph 2 of Schedule 5) we are now constituted as a First-tier Tribunal. Under section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and the new rules of procedure an appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal on a point of law may be submitted to the Upper Tribunal. A person wishing to appeal must make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of the date the Tribunal’s decision was sent. Such an application must identify any error of law relied on and state the result the party is seeking.

Subject matter: Qualified exemptions - Law enforcement s.31 Absolute exemptions - Prohibitions on disclosure s.44IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2014/0055 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed in part and the Decision Notice dated 11 March 2014 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: Competition & Markets Authority Complainant: David Simmons Decision: The original decision notice shall stand save that, for the reasons set out in the Reasons for Decision below and the Confidential Annex to that decision, the Public Authority should disclose to the Complainant, within 35 days of the date of the Reasons for Decision, the information identified in the Confidential Annex. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction and Summary of Conclusions 1. This appeal is against a Decision Notice of the Information Commissioner dated 11 March 2014 (“the Decision Notice”), in which the Information Commissioner decided that the Office of Fair Trading had been entitled to refuse a request for information submitted by the Appellant because the information was exempt information under sections 31 (prejudice to law enforcement) and 44 (statutory prohibition on disclosure) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). Since the Decision Notice was issued the relevant functions of the Office of Fair Trading have been assumed by the Competition and Markets Authority, the Second Respondent to the Appeal. For simplicity we will refer to both bodies as “the Public Authority”. 2. We have decided that, with the exception of information contained in a few documents held by the Public Authority, the Information Commissioner was right to conclude that it had been justified in refusing the information request. The documents to be disclosed are listed in a confidential annex to this decision together with our detailed reasons for ordering disclosure. However we give a general indication of those reasons in paragraphs 41- 43 below. Background facts3. The Public Authority has powers under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA 1974”) to monitor the operations of those holding a consumer credit licence. In particular it may impose “requirements” on licence holders where it is dissatisfied with their conduct and it may also, where appropriate, suspend or revoke an organisation’s licence. On 7 December 2010 it exercised those powers by issuing a notice addressed to Firstplus Financial Group PLC (“Firstplus”) requiring it to (a) follow its existing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and official guidance, and (b) not to change those policies and procedures for a period of three years without prior notification to the Public Authority. This notice of requirements was issued at the end of an investigation into the operation by Firstplus of an interest variation provision included in its standard contract for second charge loans. However, the notice did not contain any indication of the facts uncovered during the investigation or the reasons for deciding that a notice of requirements was justified and appropriate. 4. The Appellant had become concerned that the terms regarding interest in the Firstplus second charge loan documentation were unfair, in particular an interest rate variation provision. Since 2009 the Appellant and other members of a campaign group, of which he is a member, have corresponded with the Public Authority with a view to persuading it to take action against Firstplus. They were particularly concerned at what they thought was a lenient approach by the Public Authority in imposing an apparently mild sanction on Firstplus and declining to provide detailed findings arising from its investigation or reasoned arguments for adopting the approach that it did. The request for information and the scope of enquiry arising under it 5. The Decision Notice proceeded on the basis that the request for information which led ultimately to this Appeal was contained in an email dated 26 June 2013 and covered, (to quote from paragraph 2 of the Decision Notice), “any information concerning adverse behaviour” by Firstplus. We became concerned, during the hearing of the Appeal, that the information request, when read in context, might have a broader meaning and asked the parties to provide us with the complete sequence of correspondence that preceded the email of 26 June 2013. 6. The material provided by the parties at that stage, read alongside other material in the bundle of documents prepared for the Appeal, demonstrated the following history: a. The Appellant entered into correspondence with the Public Authority about what he regarded as its inadequate response to the perceived unfairness of the operation by Firstplus of its interest provision. This had led to interest charges increasing (to 13.9% in some cases) during a period of time when interestrates, generally, were reducing. The Appellant’s evident purpose was to both complain about how the Public Authority had dealt with the matter in the past and to seek its assistance for the future. In that context he made it clear that he was contemplating legal proceedings against Firstplus and wished to know what Firstplus had been found guilty of by the Public Authority to justify the imposition of formal requirements. b. On 13 May 2013 the Public Authority, in the form of its Head of the Enquiries and Reporting Centre, wrote to the Appellant in an apparent attempt to pull together the various points he had raised. Having first defended the speed and adequacy of the Public Authority’s responses, the letter went on to identify a possible request for the disclosure of information under either the FOIA or the Enterprise Act 2002 (“EA 2002“). (In certain circumstances the Public Authority has a discretion under EA 2002 to disclose information it has acquired in confidence if the information is required for the purpose of litigation – see paragraph 15 below.) Although the letter provided detailed reasons for refusing to disclose under EA 2002 it said nothing about FOIA. c. The Appellant sent a reply to the Public Authority on the same day in which he said: “…we consumers are not being treated fairly/reasonably nor do we have access to a free market for the purpose of access to competition hence exploitation. Humble consumers like myself have no choice but to rely on their regulators to look into these matters & find some common ground with a regard to fixing this situation, I find it very difficult to believe that this can be ignored/let to continue without some kind of investigation.” d. In an email of 3 June 2013 the Appellant tried to be more specific in stating that he would like “any information you may be able to provide…”. That prompted a response from the Public Authority which disclosed uncertainty as to whether the Appellant was in fact intending to make an information request under FOIA. It went on to say: “if you advise us that you are in fact making a request for information under the FOIA, before we are able to deal with it, you will need to clearly describe the information that you are seeking so that we can consider whether we hold the requested information and whether or not we are under a duty to disclose it to you taking into account the exemptions which may apply.”e. On 11 June 2013 the Appellant emailed in reply, explaining some of the legal and administrative steps being taken by him and others in respect of Firstplus and seeming to suggest that he would like any information which the Public Authority held which might assist those processes. The Public Authority’s response to that communication, in a letter dated 21 June 2013, was to reiterate that it did not intend to treat any of the previous communications as a request for information under FOIA and that, if that was the Appellant’s intention, “you would need to describe the information sought to enable the OFT to consider (1) whether we hold the information requested and (2) whether or not the OFT was under any duty to disclose it.” f. On 21 June 2013 the Appellant sent the Public Authority an email in which he confirmed that he did wish to pursue the FOIA route to obtain information. His explanation of exactly what he sought is a little difficult to follow but we believe a fair reading of the document is that the information sought was any relating to the interest variation provisions relied on by Firstplus that had led the Public Authority to conclude that its requirements letter was appropriate. The Public Authority, however, stated, in a letter dated 26 June 2013 that it was still not clear to it what information was being sought and sought clarification of “what specifically you are requesting under FOIA”. g. The Appellant provided his answer to the question in an email sent on the same date, which clarified that his underlying complaint was about the operation by Firstplus of interest rates and “associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends & fair/unfair terms.” The email continued: “I would be grateful if it would be considered that any information held on related subject matter which could bring about a more informed conclusion on these matters specifically from the [Financial Ombudsman Service] initially & possibly in a legal capacity should matters have to go that far. … “If information is being held concerning adverse behaviour by [Firstplus] in relation to any of this in total or specific then I must request that consideration is given to release that information.” h. The Public Authority treated that email as a request for information under FOIA concerning adverse behaviour by Firstplus in relation to “interest rates and associated behaviour in contradiction with current market trends and fair/unfair terms” Our view as to the scope of the request for information.7. We interpret the request, in the context summarised above, as being for information relied on by the Public Authority in reaching the decision to impose requirements on Firstplus and/or disclosing the approach adopted by the Public Authority to its investigation, including the record of its conclusions and the public availability of that record. We do not think that the Appellant was asking for information about any allegations that others may have made from time to time, nor of facts or evidence that those other complainants may have presented to the OFT. He was looking for the Public Authority’s findings, in a form which he could utilise in order to support his campaign, including the pursuit of the civil claim he evidently had in mind. 8. It is evident that the Public Authority interpreted the information request more broadly in some respects (such as complaints and information requests received from third parties), and more narrowly in others (so as to exclude its detailed conclusions and its decision not to include them in the requirements notice). The Public Authority’s response to the information request 9. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 10. The Public Authority refused the Appellant’s request for information in a letter to him dated 3 July 2013. It stated that disclosure would prejudice the Public Authority’s ability to carry out effectively its investigatory functions and that the requested information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 31(1)(a) and (g). The relevant parts of that provision are as follows: “Information … is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice – (a) the prevention or detection of crime, … (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), …”“(2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are – (a) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person has failed to comply with the law, (b) the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, (c)the purpose of ascertaining whether circumstances which would justify regulatory action in pursuance of any enactment exist or may arise, (d) the purpose of ascertaining a person’s fitness or competence in relation to the management of bodies corporate or in relation to any profession or other activity which he is, or seeks to become, authorised to carry on, …” 11. The basis of the Public Authority’s reliance on this exemption was expressed in these terms: “Persons conducting investigations need sufficient space to carry out their work, free of interference and any risk the investigation will be undermined by the disclosure of information about the way in which an investigation has been conducted, the internal processes that were followed, and the relevant information from other sources.” 12. The Public Authority acknowledged that the exemption was a qualified exemption, so that the information would still have to be disclosed unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. It informed the Appellant that it acknowledged that there was a strong public interest in transparency but considered that this was outweighed by the public interest in maintaining confidence in its system of regulatory enforcement. 13. The refusal was maintained following an internal review carried out at the Appellant’s request. At that stage the Public Authority indicated, in a letter to the Appellant dated 13 August 2013, that it proposed to rely on FOIA section 31(1)(g), rather than 31(1)(a). It also asserted that it was entitled to rely, in addition, on FOIA section 44(1)(a), read alongside EA 2002 section 237. 14. FOIA section 44 reads: “(1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it – (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment.” EA 2002 section 237 reads: “(1) This section applies to specified information which relates to-(a) … (b) any business of an undertaking. (2) Such information must not be disclosed – (a) … (b) while the undertaking continues in existence unless the disclosure is permitted under this Part.” EA 2002 section 238, as applied to the facts of this case, provides that “specified information” is information which “comes to” the Public Authority in connection with the exercise of certain functions, including the conduct of investigations under the CCA 1974. 15. There are certain circumstances where, notwithstanding the prohibition set out in section 237, the Public Authority may disclose relevant information. The use of the word “may” demonstrates that the Public Authority would have a discretion as to whether or not to disclose: it would not be obliged to do so. One of the circumstances in which the Public Authority would be able to exercise the discretion in favour of disclosure is where information is sought for the purpose of establishing or enforcing legal rights through a civil claim (EA 2002 section 241A(1)). 16. FOIA section 44 is an absolute exemption. If it is found to be engaged then disclosure need not be made: there is no requirement to consider the public interest balance under FOIA section 2. 17. The Public Authority also indicated at this stage that it wished to rely also upon FOIA section 40 (in order to protect the personal data of individuals who might be identified in documents covered by the information request), as well as section 42 (to protect material included in such documents which was covered by legal professional privilege). 18. The Appellant’s response to the outcome of the internal review was to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner about the way in which his information request had been handled. The Information Commissioner’s investigation and the Decision Notice 19. Early in the Information Commissioner’s investigation he indicated that he did not intend to focus his investigation on the section 40 and section 42 exemptions because the information they covered was included in the same documents for which the original two exemptions were asserted. At the same time the Information Commissioner asked the Public Authority for a copy of the withheld information but, in light of its statutory obligation to maintain confidence, the Public Authority declined to release it without a formal Information Notice first being issued. Once that had been issued the Public Authority provided the Information Commissioner with a quantity of material which it said fell within the wide scope of the information request. The material hadbeen marked up manually to indicate which exemption was relied on in respect of each item of withheld information. 20. On 11 March 2014 the Information Commissioner issued the Decision Notice. He concluded that FOIA section 44 applied to the information in respect of which it was relied on by the Public Authority. It was information which had come to the Public Authority in the course of its investigation of complaints made about Firstplus and clearly related to the business of that company or to individuals mentioned within the information. 21. Although the decision under FOIA section 44 covered most of the withheld information there was some which did not fall within it and the Information Commissioner accordingly considered it in the context of FOIA section 31. He was satisfied that the Public Authority did have law enforcement powers that brought its activities within section 31(2) and that disclosure of the relevant information would reveal how it went about its work under CCA 1974 and would make it harder to do future work of that nature. He also concluded that disclosure would lead to the discouragement of those who might otherwise cooperate with the Public Authority. The exemption was therefore engaged, in his view. As to the public interest test the Information Commissioner acknowledged that there was a public interest in disclosure, because this would promote greater transparency and accountability in the Public Authority’s actions. In that context he drew attention to a number of individuals, who were in a similar situation to that of the Appellant and who had expressed concern about the outcome of the Public Authority’s investigation of Firstplus. He set in the balance against those considerations the public interest in the effective operation of the Public Authority’s regulatory functions, which he thought would be undermined if its methods of investigation were to be disclosed. Those being investigated would not feel able to deal frankly with it when being investigated and communications within the investigating team might become more guarded. He saw strength in that argument even though the investigation of Firstplus had been completed by the time that the information request was submitted. He also took into account that the information which had been withheld under FOIA section 31(1)(g), and which was not otherwise exempt under section 44, was minimal and would add little to public understanding. 22. The Information Commissioner concluded that the Public Authority should be able to regulate the credit licence regime, for the benefit of consumers as a whole, and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption therefore outweighed the public interest in disclosure. The Appeal to this Tribunal 23. On 17 March 2014 the Appellant lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice with this Tribunal.24. Such Appeals are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 25. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal did not seek to join issue with the detailed arguments set out in the Decision Notice. The essence of his argument was that the injustices which he felt had been suffered by people like him, who were trapped into second charge agreements at high interest rates, should outweigh the advantage of confidentiality in the regulatory processes. On that basis he asked, in effect, for the withheld information to be reviewed to see what could be made available in order to provide the public with information about the Public Authority’s investigation and its decision to serve a notice of requirements on Firstplus which did not record, or was not accompanied by, its reasons for doing so. 26. In a written Response filed by the Information Commissioner on 11 April 2014 it was argued that the effect of the Grounds of Appeal was to challenge the application of the public interest balance arising under FOIA section 31 and that there was therefore no challenge to the conclusions in the Decision Notice to the effect that the exemption was engaged. Nor, it was said, was there a challenge to the conclusion that the section 44 exemption was engaged and, in that respect, there was no requirement to consider the public interest because the exemption was absolute. 27. The Appellant did seek to clarify his Grounds of Appeal, in response to an invitation to that effect from the Tribunal Registrar, by asserting that he did wish to challenge the engagement of the section 44 exemption. However, his supporting arguments reverted to a general concern that the FOIA should not be used to prevent him, and others in a similar position to him, from being given the information requested. 28. On 21 May 2014 a Direction Notice was issued by the Chamber President to the effect that the Public Authority should be made a party to the Appeal. On 19 June 2014 the Public Authority filed its own written Response to the Appeal. It largely supported the Information Commissioner but also drew attention to the potential danger of disclosing information which might be said to have not “come to” the Public Authority and therefore to be outside the scope of the statutory prohibition relied on. Such information would, it was said, be of limited practical value for the purposes of anyone seeking to use it to call into question the appropriateness of the decision to either take, or not take, particular regulatory or enforcement actions against a holder of a consumer credit licence. It added:“It would be difficult for any fair-minded person to form any view about the appropriateness or otherwise of the [Public Authority’s] actions, on the basis of internal communications or other documents from which all information that had “come to” the OFT had been excised.” 29. The Appellant chose to have his Appeal considered at a hearing, rather than on the papers. That was his right. However, neither the Information Commissioner nor the Public Authority attended the hearing, both preferring to have the case determined on the basis of their written submissions. 30. The Tribunal was provided with the withheld information, in the same format as submitted to the Information Commissioner during his investigation. It was substantial in bulk and provided in unpaginated files, in reverse date order with a degree of overlap between the contents of different sections and an inadequate index. The Public Authority sought to impose on the Tribunal strict terms as to how the materials should be handled in order to prevent it being seen by any third party, including the Appellant. This included a requirement that the Appellant should not even be allowed to see how much material was involved. It was therefore necessary for the material to be placed in a secure place, outside the hearing room, while the appeal proceeded. It also led to the panel gaining access to the material rather too close to the date of the hearing than was desirable. 31. At the hearing the Appellant accepted that, in light of the Public Authority’s Response, the terms of FOIA section 44 left very little scope for him to develop the argument foreshadowed in his Grounds of Appeal: if and to the extent that withheld information was covered by the statutory prohibition there could be no reason to order its disclosure. His argument did, however, have impact on both the extent to which withheld information fell within the statutory prohibition for the purposes of FOIA section 44 and the issue of whether FOIA section 31 was engaged (and, if it was, the operation of the public interest balance). 32. The Appellant reiterated during the hearing that his interest was, not in seeing every item of information assembled by the Public Authority during the investigation, or every issue taken into consideration by those conducting the investigation. He simply wanted to know what it was that satisfied the Public Authority that it should issue a notice of requirements in the form that it did. The Tribunal’s deliberations and conclusions 33. The Tribunal panel has carefully considered every document made available to it by the Public Authority. This was done in part on the day of the hearing but, due to the late availability of the closed material andthe way in which it had been assembled, it was necessary to reconvene at a subsequent meeting. 34. We found that some of the material did not require to be disclosed because it falls outside the scope of the information request. We found that the withheld information included material relating to complaints and criticisms of the Public Authority submitted by individuals, (other than the Appellant) or groups. It also included requests for information from those individuals or groups. In some cases the correspondence included specific allegations about Firstplus and the way that it conducted its business. We considered that, in light of the interpretation of the information request in context, as summarised at paragraphs 7 and 8 above, these materials fell outside the scope of the information request and they were accordingly discarded. 35. Our overall conclusion is that the great majority of the remaining documents contained information falling within the scope of the information request and was properly withheld. 36. A careful study of the material satisfied us that many of the documents included information gathered by the Public Authority during the course of its investigation. They clearly recorded information that had “come to” the Public Authority in the course of performing its duties and fell within the statutory prohibition under CCA 1974. The information was therefore exempt under FOIA section 44. The materials took the form of written evidence, submissions presented to the Public Authority and notes made at meetings. On the whole we accepted that this exemption had only been relied upon in respect of documents that were clearly covered by it. 37. With respect to FOIA section 31, we accept the arguments put to us by the Information Commissioner and the Public Authority that those carrying out an investigation should be granted a considerable degree of confidentiality so that their working methods, and the thinking processes involved in assessing evidence and working towards conclusions, should not be available to the public, including those who might have an unworthy motive for obtaining such information. We are satisfied, therefore, that the Public Authority’s investigatory activities would be prejudiced if this category of information were to be disclosed. We are also satisfied that, with a few exceptions, the documents marked by the Public Authority as ones to which, he argued, this exemption applied were properly categorised as such. 38. Some of the material for which this exemption was claimed was anodyne in content. For example, it simply recorded arrangements for a meeting. In those circumstances the case for claiming that the section 31 exemption was engaged is less strong. However, as the information contained in such a document would not provide the Appellant with any of the sort of information he seeks, it would, in any event, fall outside the scope of the information request.39. The public interest in maintaining the section 31 exemption would have been stronger had the notice of requirement included, or been accompanied by, an explanation of what it was that had convinced the Public Authority that the service of such a notice was appropriate. However, we are satisfied that preserving privacy in respect of the investigation is sufficiently important that it outweighs the public interest in the disclosure of much of the material covered by this exemption. 40. In the course of our review of the materials we identified a small number of documents which are not exempt and should be disclosed. We have set out in a confidential annex to this decision our reasons for concluding that they fell within the scope of the information request and should be disclosed. 41. We are able to say, in this open part of our decision that in some cases the documents did not contain any information falling within the scope of the prohibition in EA section 237. In others the information that would bring the document within the scope of that provision can be redacted without the document as a whole losing its meaning. We have indicated in the confidential annex the redactions which should be made. 42. In some cases we have concluded that the exemption provided under FOIA section 31 does not apply because the document was created after the investigation had been completed and a decision made. We have also concluded, in those cases, that even if the exemption had applied the public interest in disclosure is at least equal to the public interest in continued secrecy so that the exemption may not be maintained under FOIA section 2(2)(b). 43. In every case where we have concluded that neither section 31 nor section 44 of the FOIA prevent disclosure we have considered, also, whether the exemptions provided in either section 40 (third party personal data) or section 42 (legal professional privilege) might apply. We are satisfied that, for the most part, the seniority of those identified justifies disclosure (because it would not constitute a breach of the data protection principles), but the names of less senior individuals have been redacted. We have made an appropriate redaction to one of the documents in order to protect legal professional privilege. We accordingly direct that the Public Authority disclose the documents identified in the annex, and redacted in accordance with guidance we have provided there, within 35 days of the date of this decision. 44. The confidential annex should itself remain confidential until the time for appealing this decision has expired and, in the event that an appeal has been filed by then, that appeal has either been withdrawn or disposed of. 45. Our decision is unanimous.Chris Ryan Judge 21st January 2015"
"291","FOI","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2012/0261 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) LONDON BOROUGH OF BARNET Appellant And THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent And DEREK DISHMAN Second Respondent Subject: s40 FOIA: personal data; s43(2) commercial interests Hearing: Held on 28 June 2013 at Field House. Decision: The appeal is unanimously upheld in relation to s40 FOIA, but not s43(2) FOIA, for the reasons set out below. Accordingly, the Council is not required to make any further disclosures. Date 12 September 2013Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 Reasons For The Decision The Request 1. On 19 December 2011, the Second Respondent (‘the requester’) requested the London Borough of Barnet (“the Council’) to provide: “the job titles .. of the 40 officers who spent some or all of the week ended 16 December 2011 at the offices of Trowers & Hamlins evaluating the four proposals for the New Support & Customer Services Organisation proposals.” Background 2. The New Support and Customer Services Organisation (NSCSO) is a project within the 'One Barnet' programme. The Council’s website indicates that this intends to reduce costs while delivering high quality services. In December 2012, a procurement exercise was run for the NSCSO project, and the preferred bidder was announced by the Council. 3. On 27 January 2012, the Council refused the request, claiming it was prejudicial to its commercial interests (s43(2) Freedom of Information Act 2000, “FOIA”), and then at a later stage that it was also exempt as personal data (s40(2) FOIA). The requester progressed the matter through the usual channels. When the Information Commissioner (‘IC’) came to investigate, he concluded that: A. The Council wrongly applied the commercial interests exemption and partially misapplied the exemption for personal data . B. The Council was required to disclose the job titles of the senior officials . Although these were personal data as they related to an individual post- holder, it was not unfair to disclose them. C. The Council was also required to disclose the job titles of the junior officials identified by the request where more than one person held the job title, because: a. Where only one individual held the job title, and they were a junior official, the title was personal data because disclosure would create a real risk of that junior official being identified and it would be unfair to make the disclosure because it would breach the official’s reasonable expectations of privacy and cause them distress. b. Titles held by more than one individual were not ‘personal data’, and so could not be exempt under s40(2) FOIA. 4. The Council provided the job titles for senior officials. This appeal focuses on whether it has to disclose those titles shared by more than one junior official as required by the IC. 2Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 Grounds of Appeal 5. The Council claims: Ground 1: The job titles of junior officials relating to more than one individual are personal data, and so are exempt from disclosure under s40(2) FOIA; and Ground 2: The IC was also wrong to find that the titles of junior officials relating to more than one individual were not exempt under s43(2) FOIA. The Task of the Tribunal 6. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by section 58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the IC is in accordance with the law or whether he should have exercised any discretion he had differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the IC, and may make different findings of fact from the IC. This is the extent of the Tribunal’s remit in this case, and therefore we do not consider any other issues raised, such as the proper use of public funds or Council email addresses. 7. The issues for this Tribunal are: 7.1 Whether junior employees who attended the meeting can be identified from the requested information alone or in combination with other available information. If so, the parties accept that it would be unfair to disclose their job titles because they accept that there are certain bloggers with hostile intentions, such that section 40(2) FOIA would exempt the information from disclosure. (We note that the IC accepted this argument, and the requester has stated that he supports the IC’s submissions. We confirmed this position in further directions to all the parties.) 7.2 Whether s43(2) FOIA applies. The Law 8. Under s.1(1) of FOIA, a person making an information request to a public authority is entitled to be informed in writing whether the public authority holds the requested information and to have it communicated to him, unless it is exempt from disclosure under the Act. 9. For these purposes, a public authority is exempt from providing information requested under FOIA where it is ‘exempt information’. 10. Exempt information includes information that is (1) personal data (s40(2) FOIA) where its disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles and (2) information which, if disclosed, would or would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of any person, including the public authority holding it (s.43(2) FOIA) subject to what is commonly described as the public interest test set out in s.2(2)(b) FOIA. 3Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 Exemption for Personal Data: A. Personal data is defined in s1(1) Data Protection Act 1998 (‘DPA’) as: “data which relate to a living individual who can be identified — (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller..” Exemption for Commercial Interests: B. The requested information would be exempt if disclosure would or would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of the Council and in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining this exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (See s43(2)FOIA and s2(2)(b) FOIA). C. ‘Commercial interests’ is not defined in FOIA. Evidence and Submissions 11. We were provided with open and closed bundles of documents, including the Notice and Grounds of Appeal, the Decision Notice, the IC’s Response of 30 January 2013, the Council’s open and closed replies of 13 February 2013, the requester’s statement of 19 April 2013 and, in closed form, the requested information. We have considered all that has been submitted, even if not specifically referred to below. We have not issued any part of this decision in confidential or ‘closed’ form. In summarising the submissions, we have added our own headings to these summaries, for ease of reference. Council’s Evidence and Submissions Ground 1 12. The Council’s arguments under Ground 1 of its appeal include: A. Disclosure of the job titles would create a real risk of the relevant individuals being identified and are thus personal data. S1 DPA defines ""personal data"" as: ‘data which relate to a living individual who can be identified…’ Standard of identifiability B. The word ""can"" indicates the standard is not certainty. It is of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and more than a hypothetical possibility. a. Department of Health v ICO [2011] EWHC 1430 (Admin) (‘the DoH case’) states: 4Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 “The DPA was enacted to implement European Council Directive 95/46/EC … the DPA must be interpreted insofar as possible in a manner consistent with the directive… Recital 26 reads… : …whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable...” … The concept of personal data in Directive 95/46/EC was considered at length by an advisory working party to the Commission, constituted under Article 29 of the directive... Its Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data was adopted in June of 2007... It noted that the proposal of the European Commission for a directive had been amended to meet the wishes of the European Parliament, that the definition of personal data should be as general as possible so as to include all information concerning an identifiable individual. It also noted the objective of the rules in the directive as being to protect individuals. The working party stated … National authorities should endorse a definition which was wide enough so that it would catch all ""shadow zones"" within its scope, while making legitimate uses of the flexibility contained in the directive… The working party report continued that, in general terms, information could be considered to relate to an individual when it was about that individual. … The report concluded that anonymous data in the sense used when applying the directive could be defined as any information relating to a natural person, where the person could not be identified, whether by the data controller or by any other person, taking account of all means likely reasonably to be used to identify that individual.” (paras 17-22) C. The Upper Tribunal in Information Commissioner v Magherafelt District Council [2012] UKUT 263 AAC stated: “…The Act should, if possible, be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Directive… it is not appropriate to look for the precision in the use of language that is usually to be expected from the parliamentary draftsman. A purposive approach to making sense of the provisions is called for.”’ (Para 59) D. The term “motivated intruder” has been used to express this principle within the IC’s Code of Practice 'Anonymisation: managing data protection risk' (the ‘IC Code’). This states: 5Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 “ the Data Protection Act 1998 says that personal data means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified from those data, or from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller. Determining what other information is ‘out there’, who it is available to and whether it is likely to be used in a re-identification process can clearly be extremely problematic. …There are two main ways for re-identification to come about. • An intruder takes personal data it already has and searches an anonymised dataset for a match. • An intruder takes a record from an anonymised dataset and seeks a match in publicly available information. … both risk scenarios are relevant and can carry with them different probabilities of re-identification. In either case though it can be difficult, even impossible, to assess risk with certainty. Despite all the uncertainty, re-identification risk can certainly be mitigated by ensuring that only the anonymised data necessary for a particular purpose is released. The fact that data has been anonymised does not mean that data minimisation techniques are not still relevant. …section 40..FOIA … means that public authorities have to assess whether releasing apparently anonymised data to a member of the public would breach the data protection principles… The test in FOIA can be particularly difficult to apply in practice because different members of the public may have different degrees of access to the ‘other information’ needed for re-identification to take place. However, a motivated intruder test can go some way towards addressing this problem. … organisations disclosing anonymised data should assess whether any organisation or member of the public could identify any individual from the data being released – either in itself or in combination with other available information. The risk involved will vary according to the local data environment and particularly who has access to information. … There will clearly be borderline cases where, in reality, it will be difficult, or even impossible, to determine whether it is likely that re- identification will take place. … In reality … some types of data will be more attractive to a motivated intruder than others – and more consequential for individuals. In reality these factors should also inform an organisation’s approach to disclosure....” (p.18-20) 6Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 E. The IC Code emphasises that it is important to take great care and to carry out “as thorough a risk analysis as possible” and data controllers are urged to “adopt a more rigorous form of risk analysis and anonymisation”. The Council contends that there is evidence in this case of motivated intruders who are well equipped to and who intend to attempt to identify the individuals whose job titles have been withheld, and then subject them to unfair distress. F. There is a reasonable likelihood and high probability of living individuals being identified if the disputed information were to be disclosed. The IC has underestimated the risk of identification in suggesting that the risk is only akin to an “educated guess”. G. The Council has explained this in more detail in closed submission and to illustrate the point it provides a hypothetical example taken in a different context: If the Council had disclosed prima facie anonymised information about, say, victims of domestic abuse or recipients of certain types of benefits where only two living individuals satisfied the description, then the 50% probability of identification would, the Council submits, make this very obviously “too close for comfort”. The risk of identification would be unacceptably high in view of the very low number of underlying individuals who meet the description. H. Furthermore, and very importantly for the purposes of this appeal, there is already a great deal of information in the public domain linking Council employees (names and job titles) with the NSCSO programme; and (b) there is clear evidence of a motivated intruder who seeks and is able to access a great deal of Council information. I. More generally, it is clear that the requester is a blogger who is a motivated intruder and has access to a significant amount of internal Council information, including – it would appear – information from the Council’s intranet. Such information would assist him very substantially in any “motivated intrusion”. J. Disclosure of junior job titles would be likely to result in the intruder identifying living individuals and then subjecting them to the sort of treatment the Council is concerned to avoid. K. A sample of further blog posts, all containing internal information which this blogger has been able to access and place in the public domain, is below: a. a blog post referencing a Director’s internal test results, which were not made public and were not widely available internally: http://lbbspending.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/why-contractors-dont- often-get- sacked.html b. a blog post referencing an internal email sent by the Council’s Chief Executive: http://lbbspending.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/the-friday-joke- redundant-we- have.html; 7Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 c. a blog post referencing information published on the Council’s internal intranet: http://lbbspending.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/meet- chief-of-haringey-in-waiting.html. L. This is only a selection based on research in preparation for this appeal; it is not an exhaustive account of the internal information which motivated intruders (the blogger and requester in this case) have made available. It reinforces that they have a desire to identify individuals who were involved in tender evaluation work of which they disapprove; the requester has asked for job title information to help him do that; disclosure of the disputed information would provide him with a very specific starting point from which he will (or at the very least, is reasonably likely to) obtain other information (using the means by which he has already accessed information referred to in his blog posts) with which his identification exercise could readily be completed. The unfair and distressing targeting of these individuals would then be highly likely to ensue. M. The Council acknowledges that the posts referenced above post-date the request. The test for the risk of identification is, however, forward-looking: “all the means likely reasonably to be used” (Recital 26 European Council Directive 95/46/EC). At the time of these requests, the matters explained above were likely to come to fruition. N. Whilst FOIA is normally approached “applicant-blind”, in this case the factors relied upon by the Council relate largely to the work and conduct of the requester in this case. This does not undermine the Council’s case: to whatever extent the “applicant-blind” principle is sound, Recital 26 is clear in its reference to “all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person” (emphasis added). For these purposes, it makes no difference that the “other person” happens to be the requester; the requester is also a member of the public. It would be entirely artificial in the circumstances of this case to overlook the reality of this requester’s intentions and the information he has already obtained and published about named Council employees involved in the NSCSO work to which he objects. O. The Council also argues - initially in closed submission, but then in open, that even if the motivated intruder were to ‘identify’ the wrong official in the Council from the job titles given, the reality remains that disclosure of the job title would be likely to result in the intruder identifying a living individual (albeit not the one he seeks) and then subjecting that individual to the sort of treatment the Council is concerned to avoid. Ground 2 13. The Council’s arguments for Ground 2 include: A. Disclosure of the disputed information at or around the time of the request (December 2011) would have created a weighty risk of the Council’s commercial interests being prejudiced in a way that was real, actual or of substance, such that it also relied on s43(2) FOIA. Even if the relevant individuals could not be accurately identified from the disputed information, disclosure of their job titles would nonetheless be likely to result in: 8Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 a. approaches being made to the holders of these job titles by people seeking to influence the decisions they were taking or input they were providing with respect to the NSCSO procurement work. b. inappropriate lobbying activity and undue and distressing criticism, thereby impeding their ability effectively to carry out their duties as regards this particular work. B. Given the size and value of the project, this represented a real risk of substantial prejudice to the commercial interests of the Council and those tendering for NSCSO work. That would be strongly against the public interest, whereas disclosure of the particular information in dispute would not serve the public interest in a meaningful way. Respondent’s Submissions Ground 1: 14. The IC’s arguments on Ground 1 include the following: A. Information that does not relate to and identify an individual is not personal data. B. The DPA must be interpreted insofar as possible in a manner consistent with the European Council Directive 95/46/EC including recital 26: ""Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable person; whereas to determine whether a person is identifiable account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person: whereas the principles of protection should not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable..."" (Emphasis added.) C. This was explicitly recognised by the High Court in the DoH case in which the Court found that anonymised data that do not lead to the identification of a living individual are not personal data and thus may be disclosed to the public. D. It is a question of fact, based on the circumstances of the case, whether, on a balance of probabilities, an individual or specific individuals may or may be reasonably likely to be identified by cross-referencing 'anonymised' data with other information reasonably available to them (See Information Commissioner v Magherafelt District Council ([2012] UKUT 263 instance, §79). E. The IC Code suggests that, if it is not clear whether individuals can be identified from the data, we should consider: a. whether it is 'reasonably likely' that an individual can be identified from those data (here, the disputed information) and from other data. 9Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 b. whether a 'motivated intruder' would be able to achieve re- identification of an individual. The 'motivated intruder' starts without any prior knowledge but wishes to identify the individual from whose personal data the 'anonymised' data has been derived. c. what other information would be available to a 'motivated intruder' from the internet, libraries, all public documents, making enquiries of people who may have additional knowledge of the identity of the data subject or advertising for anyone with information to come forward, etc. d. whether the identification involves more than an educated guess that information is about or relates to a specific person. While the IC accepts that the possibility of making an educated guess (whether or not correct) about an individual's identity may present a privacy risk, it does not present a data protection risk because there has been no disclosure of personal data. F. The IC acknowledges that in some circumstances it can be difficult to establish accurately the risk of identification. In this case, the IC accepts that the numbers of persons in the relevant posts are in some cases quite low, and that the identification of junior members of staff might subject them to adverse comment from third parties, possibly bloggers or others who comment on the Council's activities, because of their attendance at the relevant meeting. G. The Council has failed to set out any plausible arguments as to how disclosure of the requested information (either on its own or in combination with other information which a third party or 'motivated intruder' would be reasonably likely to obtain) would or would be reasonably likely to enable identification of the specific post holders who attended the meeting. Ground 2 15. The IC’s arguments on Ground 2 include the following: A. ‘Commercial interests’ is not defined in FOIA. The IC’s own guidance regards a commercial interest as relating to a person’s ability to participate competitively in a commercial activity, i.e. the purchase and sale of goods or services. B. The IC accepts that the Council’s activities in respect of the broader procurement procedure clearly relate to its ability to engage in a commercial exercise, namely the purchase of goods or services. C. S43(2) FOIA consists of 2 limbs which clarify the test for probability of prejudice arising from disclosure. The IC considers that “likely to prejudice” means that the possibility of prejudice should be real and significant, and certainly more than hypothetical or remote. “Would prejudice” places a much stronger evidential burden on the public authority and must be at least more probable than not and certainly more than hypothetical or remote. 10Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 D. The Council explained during the IC’s investigation that the NSCSO procurement had experienced opposition from members of the public and pressure groups. The Decision Notice explains that the Council argued that someone opposed to the NSCSO procurement or partisan to a particular company to win the contract would be able to contact the officials directly and try to exert pressure on the decision- making process. It considered this to be an unacceptable risk as there was a need to ensure that evaluators were as independent and as objective as possible in reviewing bids and awarding scores. The Council pointed to the considerable length of the contract at stake and its potential monetary value as factors intensifying the need for protecting the process. E. The IC considered it entirely appropriate that members of the public should be able to lobby and question the Council about its decision-making, and given the acknowledged controversial nature of the NSCSO procurement and the broader public interest in the Council’s One Barnet programme, there should be an expectation within the Council that its actions in this regard would be subject to scrutiny. F. The IC accepted the possibility that disclosure of the information might have an impact on the procurement process and result in correspondence which affected the council’s administrative burden. However, he did not accept that it would be likely to prejudice or even affect the Council’s commercial interests. Firstly, the withheld information did not reveal anything about the Council’s approach in relation to the specific procurement exercise and, secondly, the Council officials were free to disregard and to remain otherwise uninfluenced by correspondence or approaches by members of the public or lobbyists. G. The IC concluded that the exemption was not engaged and did not provide arguments in relation to the public interest test. Requester’s Submissions and Evidence 16. The Requester stated that he supported the IC’s arguments. He also made the following comments: A. The procurement exercise was over such that the reason for withholding the information - potential for damage to commercial interests - had now passed. B. He was not minded to lobby individual Council employees. Even if he had been, he would have needed to lobby at least 21 to be sure of getting a majority, assuming they each had equal influence in the process, and as the process was now over any danger would have passed. C. He was hardly likely to lobby for either BT or Capita as he was not keen on either and would have preferred that the Council priced the final bids against in-house ones in order to clearly demonstrate what is to be gained by out-sourcing. Now the danger period had passed, the titles in question should be released. 11Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 D. He was less bothered about junior employees doing the scoring than the very senior management as they actually carried out the tasks that were being outsourced and so would have a clearer idea of the skill set required. E. He was curious as to who was effectively taking the decisions about which contractor the Council would end up with and had no idea what he would do with the answer until he was in possession of it. F. FOI responses received by him were not automatically shared with others. In theory, the Council would make a decision but since they would be presented with a recommendation from officials of a clear win for Capita, and BT as a reserve several percentage points behind, it was extremely unlikely that they would do anything other than vote in favour of awarding the contract to Capita which they duly did on 6 December 2012. G. As regards the ‘motivated intruder’ arguments described above, he noted that until he saw the information he did not know what he would do with it and whether or not he would put any of it on his blog as he did not know what interest it might present to readers. As it was information relating to an event that took place some 19 months ago he considered it likely to present little interest. His blog entries of his earlier days (which this Tribunal presumes are those we were presented with) were of a ‘job’ type, but his blog had evolved and no longer featured this in 2013. He did not agree that a motivated intruder would be likely to result in the intruder identifying the wrong individual. The Council had not raised any examples of him, or any other party, doing so. If he were to make a factual error, he would correct it. H. He did not plan to try and identify any junior official from their job title following any release of information occasioned by this appeal. Ground 2 I. There was no prejudice to the commercial interests of the Council as the contract award decision had been taken before the Council’s Council reply in these proceedings. Our Findings Ground 1 17. The parties have accepted that the issue for us to decide is whether the requested information is personal data. We are guided by the DoH case and the excerpts repeated in paragraph 12 above. Accordingly, we must consider whether a person is identifiable from the requested information, taking into account all means likely reasonably to be used by any person. The question is whether junior officials would be identifiable from the requested material and anything else in the possession of or likely to come into the possession of the requester or another person. From the blogs we have seen, it is clear that the requester is able to access a great deal of Council information. From the evidence we have seen, including the requested information, we consider there would be very little in the way of the requester identifying junior officials if the 12Appeal No. EA/2012/0261 requested information were to be disclosed. While an individual would not need to be particularly ‘motivated’ in order to find out those identities, the requester has shown some motivation and ability to do so. That the requester has blogged on this clearly shows that he has an interest in accessing such information, even if he then decides not to blog about it. He appears to be interested and motivated to find out the officials’ identities, and if given the job titles there would be little in the way of him achieving that. 18. In short, we consider that in this case, officials are likely to become identifiable from their job title and other information that the requester is reasonably likely to have and to obtain. This is supported by the requester’s involvement with blogs and apparent access to the Council’s intranet, neither of which he has disputed. 19. It follows that the requested information is personal data for the purpose of S40 FOIA. 20. If the requester or any other motivated person were to identify the wrong official in the Council from the job titles given, we consider that it would still amount to the identification of a living individual (albeit not the one he seeks), and the information would again be personal data for the purpose of s40 FOIA. 21. We note that the requester argues that his blog has evolved such that he no longer tends to blog about job holder identities. He also states that if he were to make an error as to the jobholders’ identities he would correct his blog if informed, and that he did not plan to identify the names of junior job holders. He also states that he does not know what he would do with the information until he has seen it. This does not alter our view. This is because our task is to determine whether officials would be identifiable from the requested material and the potential impact this may have on their legitimate interests. 22. The further question as to whether the personal data is exempt under s40 FOIA and, in particular, whether its disclosure would comply with the data protection principles in the DPA, has not been disputed by the parties, and on this basis they agree it is exempt. Ground 2 23. We do not consider that s.43(2) FOIA applies to the requested information in this case, for the reasons advanced by the IC as set out in his Decision Notice and above. In particular, on the evidence presented by it, we do not think the Council has demonstrated that the requested information would or would be likely to prejudice any commercial interests of the Council or of another person. No parties presented any arguments in relation to the public interest test under this exemption, but they are not necessary for us to consider since we do not consider the exemption to be engaged. 24. Our decision is unanimous. Judge Taylor 12 September 2013 13"

The appeal is dismissed. 2. The Penalty Notice dated 4 December 2018 is confirmed. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is a data controller within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 20181 (“DPA”). As such, it is required to comply with the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 (“the Regulations”)2. As a “tier 1” organisation, the Appellant’s fee was £40. 4. The Appellant failed to provide the Respondent with the information required by regulation 2 (3) of the Regulations or to pay to the Respondent the Data Protection Fee required by regulation 2 (2) of the Regulations by the compliance date of 28 May 2018. 5. The Respondent served a Notice of Intent on 5 October 2018 and, in the absence of any representations from the Appellant, served a Penalty Notice of £400 on 4 December 2018. 6. The Appellant has appealed to this Tribunal on the basis that its default was an innocent mistake and asks that the penalty be revoked by the Tribunal. Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 20 December 2018 relies on grounds that it did not receive any correspondence from the Information Commissioner about the fee being due until it received the Penalty Notice. The Appellant states that it informed the Respondent of a change of address in April 2016. It accepts the Notice of Intent was sent to its current address but states this was not received. 8. The Respondent’s Response dated 31 January 2019 resists the appeal. She submits that the Penalty regime has been established by Parliament and that there is no requirement to issue reminders (although a reminder was in fact sent in this case). It is accepted that the Appellant’s failure to comply with the Regulations was due to an oversight, but it is submitted that the imposition of a Penalty was appropriate in all the circumstances. The Respondent notes that the Appellant had been a data controller prior to the commencement of the Regulations and had paid the relevant fees under the earlier legislation so should have had relevant administrative systems in place. It is submitted that the level of penalty is appropriate. 1 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents 2 The Regulations were made under s. 137 DPA. See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/480/contents/made 29. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 30 pages. The Law 10. The Regulations came into force on 25 May 2018. They replace the previously applicable regulations, made in 2000. Regulation 2 requires a data controller to pay an annual charge to the Information Commissioner (unless their data processing is exempt). It also requires the data controller to supply the Information Commissioner with specified information so that she can determine the relevant charge, based on turnover and staff numbers. 11. A breach of the Regulations is a matter falling under s. 149 (5) of the DPA. Section 155 (1) of the DPA provides that the Information Commissioner may serve a Penalty Notice on a person who breaches their duties under the Regulations. S. 158 of the DPA requires the Information Commissioner to set a fixed penalty for such a breach, which she has done in her publicly-available Regulatory Action Policy3. The specified penalty for a tier 1 organisation which breached regulation 2(2) is £400. The statutory maximum penalty is £4,350, which will be appropriate where there are aggravating factors. 12. Schedule 16 to the DPA makes provision as to the procedure for serving Penalty Notices, which includes the service of a Notice of Intent written inviting representations. 13. An appeal against a Penalty Notice is brought under s. 162(1)(d) DPA. S.162(3) DPA provides that “A person who is given a penalty notice or a penalty variation notice may appeal to the Tribunal against the amount of the penalty specified in the notice, whether or not the person appeals against the notice.” 14. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is established by s. 163 DPA, as follows: 163 Determination of appeals (1) Subsections (2) to (4) apply where a person appeals to the Tribunal under section 162(1) or (3). (2) The Tribunal may review any determination of fact on which the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought was based. (3) If the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or 3 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 3(b) to the extent that the notice or decision involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that the Commissioner ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute another notice or decision which the Commissioner could have given or made. (4) Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. … 15. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. 16. It is increasingly common for the General Regulatory Chamber to determine appeals against financial penalties imposed by civil regulators. In appeals against Fixed Penalty Notices issued by the Pensions Regulator, tribunal judges have frequently adopted the approach of asking whether a defaulting Appellant has a “reasonable excuse” for their default, notwithstanding the fact that this concept is not expressly referred to in the legislation. This approach was approved by the Upper Tribunal in The Pensions Regulator v Strathmore Medical Practice [2018] UKUT 104 (AAC).4 There is much case law concerning what is an is not a “reasonable excuse” and it is inevitably fact-specific. An oft-cited definition is the one used by the VAT Tribunal (as it then was) in The Clean Car Company v HMRC (LON/90/1381X) as follows: “…the question of whether a particular trader had a reasonable excuse should be judged by the standards of reasonableness which one would expect to be exhibited by a taxpayer who had a responsible attitude to his duties as a taxpayer, but who in other respects shared such attributes of the particular appellant as the tribunal considered relevant to the situation being considered. Thus though such a taxpayer would give a reasonable priority to complying with his duties in regard to tax and would conscientiously seek to ensure that his returns were accurate and made timeously, his age and experience, his health or the incidence of some particular difficulty or misfortune and, doubtless, many other facts, may all have a bearing on whether, in acting as he did, he acted reasonably and so had a reasonable excuse….” The Facts 17. There appears to be no dispute between the parties as to the facts in this case. The Appellant implicitly accepts that it received the Penalty Notice. The Appellant also accepts that the Notice of Intent was sent to the correct address, although it states this was not received. It states a reminder sent by post on 3 August 2018 went to the wrong address. 18. The Appellant expressly accepts that it was in breach of its legal obligations under the Regulations on the relevant date. 19. The Appellant has not provided corroborating evidence, 4 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5acf131ee5274a76be66c11a/MISC_3112_2017-00.pdf 420. The Respondent has provided the Tribunal with copies of the correspondence and Notices it sent to the Appellant. The Respondent sent email reminders to the Appellant on 14 May 2018 and 17 August 2018 and has provided an electronic record of receipt for the second of these. 21. Conclusion 22. We have considered whether the Appellant has advanced a reasonable excuse for its failure to comply with the Regulations. We conclude that it has not. We conclude that a reasonable data controller would have systems in place to comply with the Regulations and that the Appellant has pointed to no particular difficulty or misfortune which explains its departure from the expected standards of a reasonable data controller. 23. We note that the reminder sent by the Respondent on 3 August 2018 was sent to the Appellant’s former address. We further note that the Notice of Intent was sent to the correct address identified by the Respondent by searching records at Companies House, and that the email reminders were sent to the email address recorded in the Notice of Appeal. 24. We are satisfied by the evidence that reminders were sent to the Appellant by email and the Notice of Intent was posted to the correct address. We conclude that the Appellant has not established a reasonable excuse for its failure to pay the fee in this case. 25. We have considered whether there is any basis for departing from the Respondent’s policy as to the imposition of a £40 fixed fee in the circumstances of this case. We conclude that there is not. 26. Having regard to the relevant principles, we note that the Appellant in this case has not presented any evidence of financial hardship which could affect the penalty. 27. We have gone on to consider whether there is any other basis for departing from the Respondent’s policy as to the imposition of a £400 fixed penalty in the circumstances of this case. We conclude that there is not. 28. For all these reasons, the appeal is now dismissed and the Penalty Notice is confirmed.

"67","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Decision notice FS50790769 Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0175 Considered on the papers On 23 August 2019 Before JUDGE CHRIS HUGHES TRIBUNAL MEMBERS NIGEL WATSON & ANDREW WHETNALL Between NIGEL MEADOWS Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS 1. The Appellant in these proceedings has brought a number of complaints to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) and has been disappointed with the outcome of these complaints. He is concerned at the possible impact of changes to the arrangements for the review of its handling of complaints against itself. The background is set out in Appendix 1. On 6 June 2018 he sent a six part request for information to PHSO (Appendix 2) .2. In the subsequent process PHSO confirmed that FOIA only gave the right to information in a recorded form. It gave links to information related to part 1, stating that the information was reasonably accessible, that the cost of replying to Part 2 would exceed the cost limit, it did not hold information in recorded form in response to part 3, although it provided some general information and that 4,5,6 had been dealt with in reply to a previous request when it had explained that FOIA did not require it to provide opinions and explanations. In response the Appellant submitted an 8-part request for information (Appendix 3) exploring the PHSO response, repeating parts 4-6 and seeking further information. In the request he argued that PHSO must be able to reply to 4-6 as sufficient recorded information no doubt exists between PHSO and bodies who are highly critical of the service:- namely the Patient’s Association, pressure group PHSO the Facts and the PASC [Public Administration Select Committee of the House of Commons] to enable your office to answer these questions. PHSO responded to the request, treating it in part as a request for a review of its previous decision largely maintaining its position and providing some responses, confirming it held no recorded information with respect to 3-6 of the first request or 4-6, 8 of the second, provided a link as a response to 3 of the second, an explanation with respect to 7. 3. The Appellant complained to the Respondent IC who investigated whether the the reliance of PHSO on s21(1) with respect to part1 of the first and part 3 of the second request were justified, and whether PHSO holds recorded information falling within the scope of part of request 1, requests 3, 4, 5 and 6 (6 June 2018) and requests 1a, 1b, 4, 5, 6 and 8 (20 July 2018). 4. The IC in her decision notice reviewed the use of s21(1) FOIA (that information is reasonably available to the Appellant through other means – in this case through links to documents on the PHSO website) by PHSO. The IC found that request 1 first bullet point of 6 June was a request for an opinion. The link provided detailed PHSO’s current procedures, Service Model and Service Charter she found (DN paragraph 31) the above published information broadly addresses that request, that information was already accessible to the complainant and that PHSO can therefore rely on section 21(1). Similar reasoning applied to request 3 of 6 June DN paragraph 32). She noted the explanations given by PHSO as to how the working arrangements of its Customer Care Team (CCT) had changed and that the Appellant was seeking an opinion. She found that:- “36. With regard to question 1 and the first bullet point, in its response to the complainant PHSO had said that information had been published on its website about the changes to PHSO, its ways of working including the introduction of the CCT and its function, and guidance on the review request process. 37. If held, this information might broadly address the complainant’s request for the reason/justification for the changes PHSO had made to its external review process. This particular information is not published on PHSO’s website any longer and theCommissioner approached PHSO to see if it still holds a copy of the information that had been published. 38. PHSO made further enquiries with its Governance Team and identified information that it acknowledges falls within the scope of question 1 and the first bullet point: an External Review Quality Committee Paper and the minute from a Quality Committee meeting. PHSO confirmed it had been unable to locate any further relevant information. The Commissioner finds that PHSO breached section 1(1) and section 10(1) of the FOIA with regard to this information; it did not confirm it holds this information or communicate it to the complainant within 20 working days.” 5. The IC then considered the PHSO argument that requests 3-6 were requests for an opinion not for recorded information and that following investigations and searches PHSO had concluded (decision notice paragraph 40) “PHSO’s view is that there is no requirement under FOIA to provide an opinion or answer general questions if information is not held. “ 6. IC noted that: 41. Request 3 includes a request for “What criteria did a complaint have to meet in order for the PHSO to carry out an external review…” The Commissioner queried PHSO’s response to this part with PHSO – she considered that it might be the case that PHSO could hold recorded information that addresses this part of request 3. 42. Having approached its Governance Team again, PHSO identified a Review Guidance document that was in place at the time and which details criteria for reviews. The Commissioner understands that PHSO considers that this information broadly addresses request 3. PHSO has explained that the Guidance document is the criteria for all reviews and does not detail separately what criteria a complaint had to meet in order for PHSO to carry out an external review, except when joint working with the Local Government Ombudsman. It advised that removing the external review function has not changed its actual process in terms of what it reviews and says that PHSO’s Review and Feedback Team (formerly CCT) still regularly upholds reviews and reaches impartial decisions. 43. As with the information at paragraph 38, the Commissioner finds that PHSO breached section 1(1) and section 10(1) of the FOIA with regard to this information; it did not confirm it holds this information or communicate it to the complainant within 20 working days. 7. The IC then reviewed the requests of 20 July and concluded that Requests 1b, 4, 5 and 6 of 20 July 2018 were repeats of requests 1 (first bullet), 4, 5 and 6 of 6 June 2018 and that she had dealt with them. With respect to requests 1, 1a and 8 she noted the PHSO argument that these were requests for an opinion.“1) The reason why the FOI Office were previously unable to answer parts of this question in the detail they have currently provided. a) How the removal of an external review process and reliance on the Customer Care Team to handle reviews can avoid the potential for bias with their judgement and on the decisions they reach on complaints. .. 8) In light of the criticisms the PHSO has received for being an ombudsman service that is unfit for purposing dealing with complaints fairly, openly and transparently -- Please explain how the PHSO can assure service users that their complaints have been dealt with properly and in accordance with those principles.” 8. The IC took a somewhat different view of how these requests should be considered (DN paragraph 47):- “But in order to release relevant information to the complainant, between 13 July 2018 and 20 July 2018 PHSO would need to have considered whether or not it had answered all of the parts of the 6 June 2018 request, identified why it had been unable to answer any parts and recorded this information. This is not a scenario that the Commissioner considers is likely to have taken place. She is therefore satisfied that PHSO does not hold recorded information falling within the scope of request 1.” 9. With respect to 1a she approached the PHSO who explained (DN paragraph 49) “the information it has identified at paragraph 38 also addresses part 1a of the 20 July 2018 request, and that it has identified no further relevant information. 50. The Commissioner considers that request 8 does read as a request for an explanation. However, she again notes that PHSO carried out searches for any relevant information with senior staff and asked staff for their recollection as to whether PHSO might hold relevant information. The searches and discussion did not identify relevant information. As with the requests of 6 June 2018 therefore, given the particular nature of request 8, the Commissioner is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that PHSO does not hold information in recorded form that would address it.” 10. The IC concluded “51. The Commissioner has carefully considered all the relevant parts of the complainant’s requests, PHSO’s response and it submissions to her. On the balance of probabilities she is satisfied that PHSO holds no further information that is relevant to the complainant’s requests and that, once it has released the additional information it has now identified, it will have fully complied with section 1(1) of the FOIA.” 11. In his notice of appeal the Appellant argued that the IC had failed to obtain meaningful answers to his requests, , while he had been provided with links toinformation it doesn’t mean to say that the information they published was able to answer my questions. The PHSO had been evasive:- “to support this view I would refer you to questions 1a, 1b, 3,4,5,6 and 8 in my information requests of 20 July 2018 as I fail to accept that an health ombudsman service which has received numerous complaints and criticisms form dissatisfied users of the service and staged meetings with the agencies mentioned in my complaint are unable to provide answers to the questions I have raised as the PHSO no doubt have records of those meetings and the concerns of those agencies both past and present to provide the information I have requested.” 12. The Appellant stated that the outcome of the appeal he was seeking was:- “Acknowledgement from the PHSO that their failure to provide answers to service related issues and not informing the complainant whether the information they required was accessible and was able to answer their questions offers no assurance to complainants that their policies, procedures and guidance for dealing with complaints are open, transparent and fit for purpose and shows there are serious flaws and deficiencies with their methods of operation that undermines trust in the health ombudsman service” 13. In resisting the appeal the IC set out the role of the tribunal in considering an appeal set out in s58 FOIA:- “58 Determination of appeals. (1)If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers— (a)that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b)to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 14. In the light of that statutory definition she submitted that the issue for the tribunal was whether the decision notice was wrong in law whereas the outcome that the Appellant was seeking was not within the powers of the tribunal. She stated that she had found breaches by PHSO in handling the request. She noted that the issue was whether the decision notice was correct in law – i.e. the outcome of the decision notice which it was the tribunal’s task to determine not how the IC had conducted her investigation. 15. In resisting the Appellant’s claim that further information must be held in relation to 1a, 1b, 3,4,5,6 and 8 of the second request she noted that he had not provided any concrete evidence of what should be held. She had reached her conclusions based on searches carried out by the PHSO and the explanationsand reasons for why information was not held. The issue was decided on the balance of probabilities. 16. In resisting the claim that PHSO has offered no clear direction where information he requires is located she noted that PHOS had provided direct hyperlinks to sections of its websites where the information was held, the IC had tested these links and was satisfied these work and also broadly satisfy the Appellant’s request. 17. In seeking to rebut the claims of the IC in her response the Appellant argued that PHSO responses to FOIA requests failed to provide direct answers to questions or provided no answers to questions, criticised PHSO for not giving a specific reason why information is not held in a recorded form, argued that the PHSO or IC should have specified precisely where the information was held in claiming s21 applied and argued that all the questions asked “are within scope of PHSO to answer”. In support of these claims the Appellant submitted a Parliamentary report critical of PHSO, a paper by a lobby group critical of PHSO headed PHSOtheFACTS, a paper by the Patients Association critical of PHSO, a listing of FOI requests about PHSO compiled by PHSOthe FACTS, an extract from a Parliamentary debate and the IC guidance on s21 FOIA. Consideration 18. The purpose of FOIA is to give individuals access to recorded information held by public authorities. This is logically distinct from a requirement on public authorities to answer questions. While the Appellant criticises PHSO for “partially answering some of the questions and failing to answer the majority”; that is beside the point. People may well want a public authority to answer a question relevant to its work but that is not a right directly given by FOIA, the right is to have recorded information which is held. That information may or may not be sufficient to answer a question that people wish to pose but there is no requirement under FOIA to formulate answers to questions or to enter into a debate or policy discussion. The question of how adequately or inadequately the PHSO carries out its statutory functions is a question for Parliament and not one for the IC or the tribunal. The question of whether or not individuals are satisfied with the PHSO is again outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Whether a public authority holds in recorded form the answer to a particular question put to it is a matter of fact. The Freedom of Information Act does not create an obligation to construct an answer. As the prehistory summarised in Appendix 1 demonstrates, the information requests in this case were an extension of a prolonged series of exchanges with the PHSO in which the Appellant expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the outcome of a long running complaint and application for redress, and used it to illustrate his views on the PHSO’s general shortcomings. The purpose was to sustain his challenge to decisions he did not accept, press his case that there should be a facility for independent review of the PHSO’s decisions, and use FOIA in away which, he believes, leaves the PHSO no option but to continue to engage in debate about what he perceives to be its many and abject failures. 19. The problems which these boundaries present for the Appellant in seeking answers may be illustrated by looking at key parts of the requests identified by the Appellant in his notice of appeal where the response is a matter of concern (omitting 3 where the IC’s investigation elicited some information relevant to the request see paragraph 6 above DN paragraphs 41-43) provided:- “1) The reason why… a) How the removal of an external review…can avoid the potential for bias b) How the PHSO justify the removal of this process … 4) Whether the PHSO consider… 5) Whether the PHSO recognise… 6)…an answer is sought whether the PHSO recognise the negative impact… 8) In the light of the criticisms…please explain how the PHSO 20. The PHSO argued that 4,5 and 6 were requests for opinion and not recorded information however it carried out searches with its Operations Manager – Review and feedback team (previously CCT), Assistant Director of Strategy and Partnerships and the Senior Change and Delivery Officer. PHSO’s view is that there is no requirement under FOIA to provide an opinion or answer general questions if information is not held. (DN paragraph 39). While the Appellant has submitted documents relating to the critics of PHSO identified in his request (see paragraph 3 above and appendix 2) these do not amount to evidence that PHSO has formulated in recorded form responses to the questions posed by 4,5 and 6. In the light of the PHSO’s response to IC the tribunal is not satisfied that the Appellant has discharged the evidential burden on him to show that the IC erred. 21. Similar considerations apply with respect to the reliance on s21. In her decision notice the IC identified that the PHSO had supplied links which for the second point of request 1 of 6 June the information broadly addresses this point and that for request 3 the request for the arrangements currently in place, PHSO had provided links to a number of policies and that this information together with the information in response to request 1 addresses the question. 22. The role of FOIA is to require public authorities to disclose recorded information. There is a mismatch between the Appellant’s expectations of what FOIA can provide and rights it in fact confers. These do not include a right to have answers to questions or a right to insist that a public authority enters into or sustains its engagement with debate, perhaps particularly after the authority has said all it has to say. The question whether there is a need for independent review of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s decisions is of course ultimately a matter for Parliament.23. The tribunal is satisfied that the IC’s decision notice appropriately stated the law and correctly applied it to the facts of the case. 24. The appeal is dismissed. Signed Hughes Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 23 September 2019 “Appendix 1: The context of the Information Requests 1. In exchanges with the Commissioner’s office during the course of its investigation the Appellant submitted earlier correspondence with the PHSO which he felt illustrated its failure to remedy “serious flaws and deficiencies” and showed responses to complaints which “consistently breached the principles of good complaint handling and proceeded to stonewall my attempts at handling its flawed decisions”: 2. In a letter of 30 May 2016 to the PHSO, complaining about the inadequacy of an earlier response to an earlier complaint, the Appellant set out 20 points of failure which, in his view, “clearly show that my complaint has been subjected to the same flaws and inadequacies with its handling as those identified by the bodies I refer to [see paragraph 2 above], and in doing so it will immediately become apparent that the recurring theme with the ombudsman service is its abject failure to do anything for the complainants and to all intents and purposes is seen as a way to avoid any liability for the damage caused by the NHS . . .” 3. A response from PHSO on 23 August 2016 declined to comment further on the points raised on the grounds that “We have previously explained our view on your questions, and the remaining points you make are your view, rather than any information which shows that our decision or case handling is wrong.” “Continuing to state our position on the same concerns does not help achieve anything further for you.” 4. The Appellant responded on 23 August 2016 saying that the PHSO’s “failure to offer new explanations in response to comments in my previous letter . . . can only be seen as way of concealing the flaws and deficiencies in the way the PHSO has dealt with this complaint and to avoid the need to carry out an investigation in to matters that would no doubt reveal substandard aspects of care and treatment by NHS health providers which the PHSO has chosen tooverlook” “One of the key issues at the centre of this complaint which the PHSO has neglected to answer is how a patient who was owed a duty of care suffered fatal consequences from a routine hospital admission.” “Because all of the responses I have received from the PHSO to date have lacked substance and failed to provide any meaningful answers to account for this tragedy” the Appellant finds “the PHSO unable to lawfully justify closing down a complaint that has been compromised by their own flawed processes and gross inattention to detail” including “their failure to listen to and address the concerns of the complainants.” As a result the PHSO has “betrayed the trust of another one of its users by failing to obtain any form of apology, accountability, redress or resolution – all of which is patently at odds with the aims of a properly functioning ombudsman service.” The letter concludes “if the PHSO considers itself an open, transparent and trustworthy ombudsman service, instead of their attempts at forcing the closure of this complaint , the PHSO could start by responding to the 20 points in my letter of complaint dated 20 February 2016, the 23 points that were listed in my earlier letter of complaint dated 20 February 2014 and have no problem in honouring my request for an external review of this complaint.” 5. Further correspondence between the Appellant and the PHSO customer care team followed, including references to the Appellant’s claim for compensation to the NHSLA in 2012, on which the PHSO observed that the correct route to challenge the outcome of that process would lie through the Courts. The PHSO say that when a case worker contacted the Appellant to explore what the NHSLA had done badly in handling the complaint “you did not give any specific information about what you felt NHSLA did wrong” and because no specific concerns were given “I have not found that you provided any information which shows that our decision is wrong.” (Summarised from pp162 to 189 of the bundle.) Appendix 2 The first request “1) The reason why the PHSO has removed the external review process they originally had in place for dealing with individual complaints and decisions and why this is not made clear on the PHSO website How the PHSO justify the removal of this process and aim to build confidence and trust in the ombudsman service when their Service Model Policy and Guidance states there is no organisation that can specifically look into an individual complaint unquote, and there is na [sic] automatic right to the review of a decision the ombudsman service may have got wrongHow the current system the PHSO have in place for dealing with complaints by means of their Customer Care Team can reassure dissatisfied users of the service that the review of their complaints and the decisions they reach are fair and unbiased. 2) How many external reviewers were originally employed by the PHSO, whether they could be considered truly impartial and independent knowing they were hired under a contract with the PHSO, and whether the number they employed was sufficient to deal with the high volume of complaints the PHSO failed to resolve where the service user requested an external review of their complaint. Because questions three, four and five relate to a specific complaint the PHSO have on record and was ongoing at a time when an external review process was in place, meaningful answers are required to each of the following questions:- 3) What criteria did a complaint have to meet in order for the PHSO to carry out an external review and whether the PHSO could be considered to breach the principles of good complaint handling by refusing to carry out an external review of a complaint where the service user had provided evidence of maladministration in the way the PHSO handled their complaint and found their requests for an external review had been ignored. 4) Whether the PHSO consider they have an obligation to carry out an external review of longstanding complaints where the ombudsman service has failed to provide remedy, accountability or resolution to a complaint over the space of more than 5 years and where the service user has had continuing need to complain to the PHSO about their handling of the complaint and raised questions the PHSO has largely failed to answer. 5) Whether the PHSO recognise the need for an unbiased external review process in light of the criticisms they have received from various bodies as an ombudsman service that is unfit for purpose in dealing with complaints fairly, openly and transparently - and why as part of their strategy to deliver an exemplary ombudsman service and to allay concerns of bias by its users there are no future plans for an external review process to address this imbalance. 6) In view of the improvements the PHSO intend to make to the service over the course of the next 3 years because their objectives highlight many of the flaws and deficiencies with the service they provide and have been criticised for, an answer is sought as to whether the PHSO recognise the negative impact those flaws and deficiencies would have had on their findings and decisions on past complaints and whether they intend to revisit and reassess complaints they have failed to resolve where the service user has had continuing need to raise concerns with the PHSO about their decisions and complaint handling processes.” Appendix 2 The second request/the request for an internal review“1) The reason why the FOI Office were previously unable to answer parts of this question in the detail they have currently provided. a) How the removal of an external review process and reliance on the Customer Care Team to handle reviews can avoid the potential for bias with their judgement and on the decisions they reach on complaints. b) How the PHSO justify the removal of this process and aim to build confidence and trust in the ombudsman service when their Service Model Policy and Guidance states there is no organisation that can specifically look into an individual complaint unquote, and there is na [sic] automatic right to the review of a decision the ombudsman service may have got wrong 2) Please clarify why a record of the number of external reviewers originally employed by the PHSO either in the past year or from the period 2010 to 2016 is not easily accessible without a manual review of your reports and records as the reason you provide in answering this question effectively disallows the service user from obtaining full disclosure of the information they have requested and prevents them from obtaining resolution to their queries. 3) Following the removal of the external review process what process dies the PHSO currently have in place for dealing with complaints about the Customer Care Team when they have failed to apply the principles of good complaint handling and the service user provides evidence of maladministration in the way they have handled their complaint which they subsequently ignore. N.B. Because questions 4, 5 & 6 highlight some of the serious flaws and deficiencies with the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and its functioning, if the Guiding Principles of the PHSO are claimed to be openness and transparency It should not preclude the FOI office from answering these questions as sufficient recorded information no doubt exists between the PHSO and bodies who are highly critical of the service namely:- the Patient’s Association, pressure group PHSO the Facts and the PASC to enable your office to answer these questions. On that basis I seek meaningful answers to those questions which have been necessary to repeat. 4) Whether the PHSO consider they have an obligation to carry out an external review of longstanding complaints where the ombudsman service has failed to provide remedy, accountability or resolution to a complaint over the space of more than 5 years and where the service user has had continuing need to complain to the PHSO about their handling of the complaint and raised questions the PHSO has largely failed to answer. 5) Whether the PHSO recognise the need for an unbiased external review process in light of the criticisms they have received from various bodies as an ombudsman service that is unfit for purpose in dealing with complaints fairly, openly and transparently - and why as part of their strategy to deliver an exemplary ombudsmanservice and to allay concerns of bias by its users there are no future plans for an external review process to address this imbalance. 6) In view of the improvements the PHSO intend to make to the service over the course of the next 3 years because their objectives highlight many of the flaws and deficiencies with the service they provide and have been criticised for, an answer is sought as to whether the PHSO recognise the negative impact those flaws and deficiencies would have had on their findings and decisions on past complaints and whether they intend to revisit and reassess complaints they have failed to resolve where the service user has had continuing need to raise concerns with the PHSO about their decisions and complaint handling processes. 7) Please explain how the PHSO Guidance on Financial Remedy aims to compensate complainants for the frustration and distress caused by the ombudsman service when it has failed to provide justice, remedy, accountability nor resolution for the service user owing to the known flaws and inadequacies with the service. 8) In light of the criticisms the PHSO has received for being an ombudsman service that is unfit for purposing dealing with complaints fairly, openly and transparently -- Please explain how the PHSO can assure service users that their complaints have been dealt with properly and in accordance with those principles.”"

The appeal is allowed. The Financial Ombudsman Service is not required to take any steps. REASONS Background to Appeal 2. The Appellant made complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) in 2008 and 2009. In March 2009, the Principal Ombudsman found a complaint made by the Appellant to be vexatious and concluded that any future similar complaints he were to make should be dismissed without considering their merits. In October 2009, the Appellant made a further complaint and, without knowledge of the earlier decision, it was accepted by FOS and assessed. In June 2010 it was realised that this complaint had not been handled in accordance with the earlier decision, and so it was dismissed. The Appellant made a complaint about the service he had received to FOS’s Independent Assessor. She issued an opinion in August 2010, recommending that FOS should design and implement a robust and fair filter system, to ensure that once a warning has been issued further cases are dealt with appropriately. FOS accepted this recommendation. 3. The Appellant made a request to FOS for a copy of the documents which show how the Independent Assessor’s recommendation was implemented. FOS told the Appellant that the filter process was agreed in a face to face meeting so that it did not hold the requested information. 4. The Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50604601 on 12 July 2017, upholding FOS’s response. 5. Since the Decision Notice was issued, FOS has discovered some information falling within the scope of the request. This was an e mail exchange held in the archived inbox of a member of staff. This has now been disclosed to the Appellant. Appeal to the Tribunal 6. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 13 July 2016 relies on grounds that it was clear from the Decision Notice that there had been an instruction issued to staff to implement an electronic filter, and that this instruction should be available on FOS’s backup server so that it is “held” for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. He submitted that FOS had not conducted appropriate searches so that the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice was flawed in relying on FOS’s evidence. 7. The Information Commissioner’s Response dated 18 May 2016 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. The Commissioner was satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, FOS did not hold the information the Appellant had 2requested. She had reached this conclusion after making appropriate enquiries of FOS, as recorded in the Decision Notice. 8. FOS’s Amended Response dated 17 October 2016 supported the analysis set out in the Decision Notice. However, it acknowledged that information had now been found which fell within the scope of the Appellant’s request. This was further explained in the witness statement of Graham Price, dated 17 October 2016. FOS invited the Tribunal to find that it holds no further information within the scope of the request. 9. The Appellant replied to FOS’s submissions to the effect that he considers further information may be held by FOS. 10. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 175 pages, including submissions made by all parties, for which we were grateful. The Law 11. FOS, as a public authority, is under a duty to comply with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). S. 1(1) (a) of FOIA provides that a person making a request for information is entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information within the scope of the request. S. 84 of FOIA defines information as “information recorded in any form”. There is no requirement for a public authority to take steps to record information if none is held at the time of the request. 12. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 313. I note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. Evidence 14. FOS relies on a witness statement made by Graham Price on 17 October 2016. Mr Price is a solicitor employed by FOS. He explains the functions of FOS and the background to the Appellant’s request. He describes the searches which were undertaken by FOS and communicated to the Information Commissioner during her enquiries. He describes the further searches he arranged to be carried out when making his witness statement, including the archived inboxes of FOS staff. He states that an e mail exchange was found in a member of staff’s archived inbox, which gave the instruction to FOS’s IT Department to set up the inbox into which the Appellant’s e mails would be channelled, so as to filter them in accordance with the Independent Assessor’s recommendation. This email exchange has now been disclosed to the Appellant (redacted as to the personal data of the staff involved). It is also exhibited to Mr Price’s Statement. 15. Mr Price explains that the policy for retention of FOS e mails is to keep them for 12 months only, so his view is that FOS did not and does not hold any further information falling within the terms of the request. Conclusion 16. The task for the Tribunal under s. 58 FOIA is to decide whether the Decision Notice was erroneous. I have no jurisdiction to decide whether the Independent Assessor’s recommendation was complied with, or might have been complied with differently. I note that FOS has provided an explanation of how it has implemented the recommendation to the Appellant direct. 17. The Appellant’s grounds of appeal were that information falling within the scope of his request was more likely than not to be held on a backup server at FOS. It transpired that he was right about that and, as the factual findings in the Decision Notice were therefore erroneous, his appeal is allowed. 18. I have considered the evidence before me from Mr Price, to the effect that no more information within the scope of the request is held. I am grateful to Mr Price for the detailed information contained within his witness statement. I find it reliable, and in so finding I take into account the fact that he is a solicitor with a duty of candour to this Tribunal. I also take into account his knowledge of the workings of FOS and of this case. 19. Mr Price’s evidence is that the decision as to how to implement the Independent Assessor’s recommendation was taken at a face to face meeting in respect of which no information was recorded. I accept that evidence. His evidence is that the decision taken in that meeting was implemented by the sending of an email to the IT Department, requesting the establishment of a dedicated inbox to which the Appellant’s correspondence would be channelled. It is apparent that there was then a 4telephone conversation about the request, followed by an email back from the IT Department confirming that the mail box had been set up. I see no obvious reason for there to have been any additional information recorded about that matter, as it is clear from that exchange that the required work had been completed. I accept Mr Price’s evidence that there is no further information held. 20. It is unfortunate that the archived e mail exchange was found only after the Decision Notice had been issued. I understand that, given FOS’s retention policy, it would not have been anticipated by FOS that an e mail of that vintage would have been retained on its system. I am grateful to Mr Price for arranging the additional searches which uncovered it. 21. The Appellant, understandably, is not in a position to offer evidence to contradict the evidence of Mr Price. He asks me to draw an inference for which there is no evidential basis. 22. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that FOS held information falling within the scope of the information request at the time it was made. That information was the e mail exchange exhibited to Mr Price’s witness statement, which has now been disclosed to the Appellant with appropriate redactions. 23. On the basis of the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that FOS has now disclosed all the information it holds falling within the scope of the request and that there is no further information held. This means that, whilst this appeal is allowed, I direct no steps to be taken by FOS.

"127","FOI","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2016/0149 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) CRAWFORD AND COMPANY ADJUSTERS (UK) LIMITED Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and CHESHIRE EAST COUNCIL Second Respondent Hearing Held on 28 March 2017 at Field House and 28 April 2017 both on the basis of written submissions. Decision We unanimously dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out below. There are no further steps to be taken by Cheshire East Council. EA/2016/0149 1Background 1. On 17 July 2015, an explosion occurred at the Wood Treatment Limited (‘WTL’) site at Bosley, Macclesfield resulting tragically in four fatalities and many others being injured. 2. We are told that following the incident, the WTL site was immediately cordoned off by the Health and Safety Executive (‘HSE’) and police. All documents and physical exhibits were seized and remain in police or HSE custody to date. The police and HSE investigators remained on site for several months. An inquest into the deaths was opened and adjourned. 3. An HSE investigation is ongoing. We are told its purpose is to ascertain the cause of the explosion and to determine whether the owners and operators of the mill, or any other person, is criminally culpable for causing it. It is supported by a working group consisting of the police, Cheshire Fire and Rescue and Cheshire East Council (the ‘Council’). 4. Press reports within the Bundle of papers before us illustrated the devastating impact of the mill explosion and in September 2016 wrote that the investigation would continue for a long time. (See page 128 of the Open Bundle.) 5. Zurich Insurance is the property insurer of WTL. The Appellant are loss adjusters instructed by Zurich Insurance to assess the extent of the damage to property and identify any policy coverage issues. DAC Beachcroft LLP are solicitors advising Zurich in relation to policy coverage issues arising out of the explosion. They have sent the submissions on behalf of the Appellant. The Request 6. On 12 October 2015, the Appellant wrote to the Council, requesting information as follows, (which we have been numbered for ease of reference): “ 1. Dates and nature of all Cheshire East Council attendances at WTL Bosley since July 2014. 2. Copy reports/site notes/photos from such visits. 3. All photographs of the site, internal and external, taken on the visits 01 & 09 July 2015. 4. Recognising that you are unable to release details of individual complainants/informants, can you please confirm the source of the information that led to the EXTRA visits being undertaken by Stephanie Bierwas (see attached letter) on 01 July 2015; i.e., resident, Environment Agency or similar authority another Council department (i.e. planning) etc. 5. Dates and nature of all complaints received by Cheshire East Council about the Bosley site since July 2014 and action taken, if any, on each occasion. 6. Reference is made within the letter of developing an installation action plan to ensure permit compliance. What are the plan and permit to which this requirement relates? 7. What is permit CEC/PPC/B/012? ” EA/2016/0149 27. On 5 November 2015, the Council disclosed part 1 of the request so far as it related to ‘dates’ and parts 4, 6 and 7. The remaining information was withheld relying on regulation 12(5)(b) of The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘EIR’). This appeal concerns parts 2, 3 and 5.1 8. The Appellant progressed the matter and following the Information Commissioner’s (‘IC’) investigation, she upheld the Council’s position. The Task of the Tribunal 9. The Tribunal’s remit is set out in s.58 FOIA. It applies equally to environmental information appeals as a result of regulation 18 of EIR. In accordance with this section, the Tribunal considers whether the Decision Notice made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law, and to the extent it involved exercising discretion, whether it should have been exercised differently. The Tribunal is independent of the Commissioner, and considers afresh the Appellant’s complaint. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and make different findings of fact. 10. We have received a large number of submissions and evidence from the parties, some of which has been submitted on a confidential or ‘closed’ basis, including the requested information. We have not found it necessary to issue any of this Decision on a closed basis. We have carefully considered everything before us, even if not specifically referred to below. Procedural Matters 11. The Council did not seek to be a party to this appeal, and did not advance submissions. Having conducted its hearing on the papers, the Tribunal considered that an email from the Council to the Commissioner of 5 May 162 was a key document in the Commissioner’s case. However, we were not satisfied that the email was clear or fully made sense.3 12. The Tribunal joined the Council as a party to the hearing and directed for it to clarify certain matters.4 Consequently, the panel has benefited from a statement from Cheshire Police (‘Statement’) and HSE who elaborated upon their positions5. We consider that this should have been procured at a far earlier stage in advance of the hearing. Not doing so necessitated: the panel reconvening; further directions and the clear need for the Appellant to be able to respond to the Statement; resulting in submissions in reply to its response by both Respondents that included an invitation by the Commissioner to seek further clarity from the Police. This approach does not seem to have taken into account the constraints of the Tribunal and need to progress the case in a proportionate and efficient manner. 1 In considering the scope of this appeal, we have taken into account section 6 the Notice of Appeal at page 12 of the Open Bundle; the section 5 entitled ‘Grounds of Appeal’ at paragraphs 5 and 6 on page 14 of the Open Bundle; and the responses to the Directions of 3 April 2017. 2 See page 100 of the Open Bundle. 3 See further the Open Directions of 3 April 2017. 4 See further, the Open Directions of 3 April 2017. In Closed Directions of 3 April, we also probed certain matters related to the contents of the Closed Bundle and were satisfied with the response received. 5 See paragraphs 24 and 25 below. EA/2016/0149 313. The Statement was initially provided on a ‘Closed’ basis. The panel reconvened to consider the further information, and found that whilst some of the information was clearly confidential, it was not self-evident that all of it was. Again, we consider that this should have been addressed by the Council in accordance with our Directions of 3 April. Our further directions provided the Council with an opportunity to proffer reasoning on the point. The Council accepted the partial disclosure of the Statement. The Appellant was given an opportunity to respond to the material that was provided to it. The panel considers the remaining ‘closed’ material to have been properly kept confidential. The Legal Framework FOIA or EIR 14. When considering a request for information, it is important to apply the relevant legislative regime. The effect of s.39(1) FOIA, is that requests for ‘environmental information’ must be decided by reference to EIR instead of FOIA. The definition of “environmental information” is found in regulation 2. It includes: “(a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; (b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements… (f) the state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures inasmuch as they are or may be affected by the state of the elements of the environment referred to in (a) or, through those elements, by any of the matters referred to in (b) and (c);” 15. Although not addressed in detail in the Decision Notice, it is not in dispute that the EIR is the relevant regime. The Appellant made clear why it considered that the EIR applied and the Council subsequently confirmed that the inspections had been undertaken by the Council’s environmental protection officers and were carried out for officers to protect the environment. We agree with the parties on this, and find that the request falls within both regulations 2(c) and 2(f) EIR. Regulation 12(5)(b) 16. Regulation 5(1) EIR creates a duty on public authorities to make environmental information available upon request. 17. For our purposes, regulation 12(1), (2) and (5) EIR provides: EA/2016/0149 4“12(1) … a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if – (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure… (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect -… (b) the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature” The Issues 18. The issues to address are: a. Was that Regulation 12(5)(b) ‘engaged’ because disclosure of the information would adversely affect on-going investigations? b. If so, where is the balance of public interest under regulation 12(1)(b)? Issue A: Was Regulation 12(5)(b) engaged? 19. We received extensive (and not always succinct or focused) submissions in this appeal. In the interests of proportionality and ease of reference, we have set out below the submissions we consider have material relevance. 20. The Appellant’s submissions included: a. The Commissioner failed to properly apply the relevant test for disclosure in the EIR. The Decision Notice failed to address the relevant background to this matter; what the actual effect of disclosure would be and what identifiable harm or negative impact there would be. Taking a generalised approach, it did not properly consider in relation to each of the requested categories of information, the extent to which disclosure of that category of information would adversely affect the course of justice. b. None of the requested material falls within the exception and accordingly the presumption in favour of disclosure must prevail. c. The information requested would have no impact on the on-going investigation, or any future criminal trial. This is because (a) it pre- dates the explosion; (b) it is factual and limited in scope; and (c) the Council is not involved in the investigation itself. d. It is public knowledge that the Council visited the Mill before the explosion, the disclosure of the detail of those visits. Any recommendations made relating to health and safety issues as a EA/2016/0149 5consequence of them, cannot prejudice the on-going investigation or the fairness of any subsequent criminal trial relating to the explosion. e. The Commissioner also failed to take into account the Appellant’s motivations in seeking the information, and the purposes for which it sought to use them. Any information disclosed to it would not be publicly disseminated. It would be used exclusively by the Appellant and Zurich in assessing WTL’s insurance claim. Neither Zurich nor the Appellant nor DAC Beachcroft LLP act for or on behalf of WTL in any capacity whether in civil, criminal or regulatory proceedings or otherwise. The Commissioner wrongly considered the Appellant to be acting on behalf of WTL and wrongly understood disclosure of the requested information to the Appellant would effectively be disclosure of that information to WTL. (See para.s 19 and 25 of the Decision Notice.) f. Accepting that the question for determination is whether disclosure of the information to the world at large would give rise to the adverse effect, the identity and motive of the Appellant would still be relevant. The public authority is not allowed to disregard entirely the identity and motives of the requester when considering the likely effect of disclosure. The Commissioner states that disclosure would inevitably, be subject to widespread reporting in the media. There is no basis for the Council or the Commissioner to assume this given the nature of the request and identity of the requester. g. The Decision Notice was based on the prejudice that disclosure of the information would cause to criminal investigations. She cannot now say that it would also prejudice the right of a defendant to a fair trial as well. The Commissioner is not entitled to raise matters in his Decision Notice which were not raised by the public authority, nor to raise new matters on appeal that he did not raise in his Decision Notice. To do so is beyond the jurisdiction granted by section 50 and is therefore ultra vires. h. It cannot be the case that any information which has been passed to investigating authorities thereby becomes exempt from disclosure. i. In relation to photographs it is highly unlikely that disclosure would have any effect on the course of justice. j. It is unclear why further details as to the nature of each of the visits made by the Council to WTL on the dates already disclosed would have an adverse effect on the on-going investigation or the ability to conduct a fair trial. This is particularly insofar as the requested information is of the same or similar class to the information already disclosed, and the broad purpose of the visits being already known. k. As regards part 5 of the request, it is difficult to see how dates of any complaints received could have any of the prejudicial effects set out above. The dates of the Council's visits have been disclosed. The nature of the complaint presumably would be similar to those complaints referred to in the Manchester Evening News on 19 July EA/2016/0149 62015. It is difficult to see how disclosure of any action or inaction by the Council prior to the explosion, details of which have already been passed on to the investigating authorities would have an adverse effect on those investigations. Inaction may be embarrassing to the Council but that is not a reason for refusal of disclosure under regulation 12(5)(b). l. The Commissioner now asserts that the exception would be engaged because the ability of a person to receive a fair trial would be adversely affected if the decision maker's (jury's) ability to engage in objective analysis were undermined. This in turn would be the case only if such information (a) was reported; and (b) came to the jury's attention. In the aggregate therefore, the position is no higher than this. There is a possibility that disclosure of the information may affect the ability of a person to receive a fair trial. That is a long way short of satisfying the test under Regulation 12(5)(b) as clarified in Archer. The ability of any person to receive a fair trial would only be prejudiced in the event of a number of contingencies occurring, none of which are certain. m. Local knowledge and interest in this matter is very significant. In the circumstances, it is highly unlikely that any trial of any liable party would be held locally. The fact of the Council's previous involvements with the site and problems with dust are well known. The site of the explosion has been the subject to a BBC documentary and considerable exchange of information on social media. n. As the Commissioner rightly points, the Courts have developed strict rules governing media coverage of criminal trials so as to avoid prejudice of the very type upon which the Commissioner now seeks to rely. 21. The Appellant’s substantiation of its points made in paragraph 20(i) to (k) include a letter from the Council to WTL of 14 July 2015 with photos that it stated were taken during the “EXTRA inspection accompanied by my Team Leader...”; and a press report from the Manchester Evening News of 19 July 2015.6 The latter stated: “… We shouldn't assume anything. We mustn't go down the trail of assuming anything. We will make all facts available of what we know. ""There are on-going complaints, but when you have this nature of business, close to a community, there will be complaints about dust and noise and pollution which we as a council have been dealing with. ""I think we need to be very calm about what that could mean and might not mean. We really mustn't prejudge anything. The police and HSE need to investigate, but we do have complaints that we have monitored and taken care of and we will make all that available to you. ""We were there to clean up a situation of dust particles in the area, at the exterior to it, that shouldn't have been in there and we did clear it up and we have got before and after pictures showing what a job they did and they did comply completely with our orders…"" (Emphasis added). 6 See pages 60-63 and 108 of the Open Bundle. EA/2016/0149 722. The Commissioner’s submissions included: a. Disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice, because it would adversely affect the ability to conduct an enquiry and the ability to conduct a fair trial. b. The HSE has gathered evidence relating to the (a) extent of on-going health and safety problems or concerns at the Mill; (b) extent to which WTL, or any other person, was aware of any such problems, and; (c) steps (if any) taken by WTL to remedy or mitigate those problems prior to the explosion on 17 July 2015. It is under consideration and may, depending on the outcome, give rise to and form part of the evidence in criminal proceedings for corporate manslaughter. The requested information forms part of the evidence under consideration in the ongoing criminal investigation. c. The explosion and subsequent investigations are a continuing source of media interest. In particular, the regional press interest is intense (See pages 105 to 129 of the Open Bundle). Media coverage of the information is likely (i.e. more probable than not) be relevant to any subsequent trial. That coverage, which will inevitably be partisan and partial, would colour the decision-maker’s view of the evidence before he or she had an opportunity to consider it in the sober, and controlled, context of the investigative process or trial. d. Given the nature of the withheld material, if it were published before any criminal trial, it may allow a defendant or defendants to argue that their right to a fair trial was prejudiced by that disclosure. Such an adverse effect on the criminal justice process is clearly an adverse effect for the purposes of regulation 12(5)(b) EIR. Furthermore, the public interest in preventing such an adverse effect clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The risk of adverse pre-trial publicity undermining a fair trial is well known. Because of that risk, the Courts have developed strict rules governing media coverage of criminal trials. An example is the rules on strict liability contempt in criminal proceedings. (See Attorney General v Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 361). e. The evidence relating to the explosion, and the culpability of WTL or any other person in bringing it about, must be considered objectively by the relevant decision-maker. In the context of a criminal trial, that decision maker will be a jury. It is axiomatic that the investigation or subsequent trial into the explosion would be adversely affected if the decision-maker’s ability to engage in such objective analysis were undermined. f. In response to the Appellant’s argument that the material is factual and limited in scope, regulation 12(5)(b) applies to any information the disclosure of which would adversely affect a criminal investigation or fair trial. It does not matter that the information is factual. The majority of information relevant to any criminal investigation or trial will be factual in nature. The question is whether or not the factual material is EA/2016/0149 8relevant to those proceedings, and if so whether its disclosure would (that is, would be more than probable than not) prejudice them. g. In response to the Appellant’s argument that the material pre-dates the explosion, the point at which the information was created is equally irrelevant. (See Watts v Information Commissioner EA/2007/022, 20 November 2007 at paragraph 6). h. The role of Council in holding the information in the on-going criminal investigation or trial is irrelevant. Otherwise, a requester could compel a public body to produce information which is being used in criminal proceedings because that body is not, itself, conducting those proceedings, rendering regulation 12(5)(b) meaningless. i. The Appellant’s arguments related to the purpose for which it seeks the information does not assist it. The withheld information is plainly of relevance to the on-going criminal investigations, which are also concerned with assessing the culpability and fault of WTL because it has the potential to shed light on the culpability or fault. j. The argument that the Appellant wishes to use the information for purely commercial reasons, and has no intention to publish it generally does not assist it. This is based on a misunderstanding of Information Rights law. Disclosure is not, and cannot be, limited to providing information to a specific requestor exclusively for their private use. The EIR exists to increase transparency surrounding environmental information held by public authorities. Public authorities must, proceed on the basis that any information disclosed by it is disclosed to the entire world, and assess the impact of such disclosure accordingly. 23. The Commissioner also provided Closed Submissions that substantiated her position by specific reference to the requested information. They were provided in confidence because they directly refer to and reveal the requested information. 24. In response to the Tribunal’s directions, the Council forwarded the Statement of 19 April 2017, which the HSE agreed with. This included: “On receipt of the request, I understand that DI Jones considered the nature of the information sought, the circumstances, nature and extent of the current criminal investigation and the risks posed by disclosure on any subsequent criminal case. The relevant background to that is as follows below. Wood Treatment Limited are a suspect in a corporate manslaughter investigation. This status arises from an explosion at premises owned/occupied by Wood Treatment Limited (at the Bosley site) in July 2015 and involves an investigation into the deaths of four employees and injuries caused to others (in some cases very significant injuries). At this stage Cheshire Constabulary have yet to interview a representative of the Limited Company, though arrangements for this are being progressed at present and the Company have been asked to nominate the appropriate representative… As well as a corporate manslaughter investigation, two Company Directors, [xx] have been interviewed as suspects in respect of gross negligence manslaughter as well as breach of the HASAWA. This is a very significant incident in the local EA/2016/0149 9community involving the investigation of what can only be described as some of the most serious of criminal offences. In respect of the individuals under investigation, they have engaged in a fact finding interview (effectively a first account and not a “challenge” interview). They have also engaged in a second interview to comment on plans / layout information provided by witnesses and offered observations in respect of dust / debris. This second phase is also “fact finding”. The investigation has then continued. This means that the information provided is checked, issues identified and a full evidential review conducted leading to a further interview. The final interview stage includes advance disclosure of relevant material and an interview at which matters are put to the individuals concerned. It is at that stage that disclosure would be made. I am instructed that the anticipated start date for this phase is July 2017. The material requested is almost certainly part of the prosecution case in any subsequent proceedings. Provision of information to Wood Treatment Limited can only be regarded as also affording access to that information by its Directors (identified above). This investigation is complex, of the utmost severity and clearly in the public interest that it be able to run its course without risk of prejudice… DI Jones quite rightly expressed concerns that disclosure of the information requested may adversely affect the course of justice and in particular impact upon the ability of Cheshire Police / HSE to prepare and conduct the final interview phase without risk of prejudice. It is relevant in our view that, at that stage, the need to withhold the information would be short-lived given the prospective timetable for interview and thus arguably fair, reasonable and proportionate. However, what we can now say is that the investigation has moved on and we factor in the fact that the interview plans are largely complete, the documents outlined would have been in the possession of WTL prior to the incident at the mill premises at Bosley (and thus have already been seen by the requestor7) and they will be provided in any event shortly ahead of the interview phase. With that in mind, the investigation has moved forward and the risks existing at the time of our observations are perhaps less concerning now than they were at that time… our comments relate purely to the list of information requested as identified above. I am not aware of any other requests and our comments relate solely to this information not any further or wider information requests.” (Emphasis Added.) 25. In the ‘Open’ version of the letter submitted by the Council to the Tribunal of 20 April 2017, it stated: “… Cheshire police have confirmed that at the current time it is anticipated that the withheld information will be provided to [both directors of WTL] ... as Advanced Pre-Action Disclosure within the next 8 weeks...” Our Findings 26. We find that regulation 12(5)(b) was properly engaged because at the time of the request, it is more probable than not that disclosure of the information would adversely affect the course of justice, and/or the ability 7 It is noted that the Police seem to have misunderstood the identity of the requester. Given that the request under EIR is considered a disclosure to the world at large, we do not consider this germane. EA/2016/0149 10of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature. a. We accept and adopt the reasons given by the Commissioner to the extent that they are set out in paragraph 22 above as well as her Closed Submissions. b. It is highly likely that a disclosure of the requested information under EIR would bring media attention. This is because of the rare and significant nature of the fire, and the attention and broad coverage to date. (See the Appellant’s own submissions, which includes acknowledgement of social media covering the event – see paragraph 20(m)). c. Such attention would most probably have an adverse effect on the ability of the bodies responsible for the investigation to conduct their inquiry. The focus of the investigative bodies needs to be on p the investigation itself and progressing with it. The investigative bodies need to be able to decide if and when it is appropriate to disclose potentially sensitive matters to those it interviews. This is clear from the Statement8, which we have no compelling reason not to accept and do so.9 The ability of the Police, to conduct its investigation without interference and with control of what information is disclosed and when, would clearly be compromised if the material had already been published. d. As well as the adverse effect of disclosure to those being interviewed by the Police, the Commissioner additionally reasoned that publishing the material would have further adverse effects. She reasoned that media attention from the disclosure would be partisan or impartial. (See paragraph 22(d)). We accept that this would be inevitable where for instance, anyone using social media is not always constrained by a professional need to be fair and impartial. There is a strong risk (i.e. far more probable than not) that this would colour a jury member’s view on the contextual events at the outset of any trial. Additionally, there would be a strong risk that the disclosure and subsequent media attention would allow a defendant to argue that their right to a fair trial had consequently been prejudiced. Both occurrences would adversely affect ‘the course of justice, ability of a person to receive a fair trial or of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature’. e. We agree with the Appellant’s point that refusal to disclose is only permitted to the extent of the adverse effect, and have duly taken this into account. However, we consider that the regulation is engaged for all of the material requested. 27. We are not persuaded by the submissions of the Appellant. a. The Appellant seems to have argued that the Respondents’ position is that in aggregate there is a possibility that disclosure of the information 8 See paragraph 24 above. 9 Save for the inaccuracy set out in footnote 7. EA/2016/0149 11may affect the ability of a person to receive a fair trial. However, this is based on number of contingencies occurring, none of which are certain such that it cannot be said that the adverse effect is more probable than not. We have considered that there are a number of potential adverse effects of disclosing the material and that each would be more probable than not to apply, such that the combined effect would be that disclosure would be highly likely to have an adverse effect. Even if we are wrong on this, we consider that disclosure would trigger risks of a jury member’s view being coloured by consequent media attention and the Defendant/s arguing that their right to a fair trial had been prejudiced. Given the utter importance in the right to receiving (and arguably perceiving) a fair trial, that trigger of risk is in itself an adverse effect on the ‘the course of justice, ability of a person to receive a fair trial or of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature’. We would note that because an exception under EIR is considered to be engaged, this does not mean that the material would necessarily be withheld.10 b. We agree with the Appellant that merely passing on information to the investigating authorities would not make it become exempt from disclosure. However, this is not an accurate description of events since certain information requested by the Appellant was disclosed. It is also not an accurate description of the relevant stages in considering whether an exception applies as set out in paragraph 17 above. In any event, the Commissioner has provided detailed reasoning and our decision is made after carefully reviewing the material and arguments before us, including the requested information. We consider that the applicable regulation 12(5)(b) does apply to every category part of the information requested and that Statement from the Police (confirmed by the HSE) seems to us sufficiently strong, understandable, and compelling. c. The Appellant’s argument that the material itself cannot prejudice the on-going investigation or the fairness of any subsequent criminal trial was a ‘mere assertion’. We disagree, based on reviewing the material and the arguments before us. That the Appellant had seen photos sent by letter from the Council to WTL, is entirely different from disclosing information under EIR, and in any event, we must consider the status of the particular information that has been withheld. Likewise, the comments made in the Manchester Evening News do not alter our requirement to consider whether EIR applies to the information, (although they may be relevant to illustrate the public interest in disclosure). d. Likewise, the Appellant made ‘mere assertions’ relating to new arguments by the Commissioner11 and the relevance of material being factual; limited and predating the explosion. A reading of regulation 10 Paragraph 17 above makes clear the relevant stages in considering whether an exception applies. 11 It is not clear on what basis the Appellant asserts that the Commissioner is limited in its ability to raise new matters, and the assertion seems to us to be entirely wrong. The Tribunal’s consider matters afresh and the parties may advance new evidence and arguments. In any event, it is factually inaccurate to assert that the Decision Notice raised matters not raised by the Council. EA/2016/0149 1212(5)(b) shows that it is clearly not limited in the ways suggested by the Appellant. e. The Appellant asserts relevance to its motive and intended use for the requested information, including that there would in fact be no adverse effect because there would not be a publication of the material. However, it provided no legal basis for its arguments. Based on the arguments before us, we accept the reasoning given by the Commissioner. For these purposes, a disclosure under EIR is a publication and so is deemed to be made to the world at large. Assurances by a requester as to the Appellant’s use cannot be relied on. Generally, a public authority is not required to withhold information requested, and might decide to come to a private arrangement, but this would be outside of the EIR regime. 28. It is noted that in the Statement the Police expressed an intention to provide the material to those being interviewed shortly ahead of the interview phase. They considered that with the investigation having moved forward, the risks existing at the time of their observations were perhaps less concerning than they had been. The Council additionally explained that the Police had confirmed when it was anticipated that the withheld information would be provided to both directors of WTL under a process of Advanced Pre-Action Disclosure. This does not affect our decision. This is because (a) in considering the application of the regulation, we take into account the risks as they were at the time of the EIR request and its consideration by the Council; and (b) a disclosure under a pre-action process to relevant persons, is not akin to a disclosure under EIR to the world at large. 29. It is also noted that in relation to any prejudice to the investigation arising from disclosure, the Statement explained that “disclosure of the information requested may adversely affect the course of justice and in particular impact upon the ability of Cheshire Police / HSE to prepare and conduct the final interview phase without risk of prejudice.” The Appellant sought to emphasise that regulation 12(5)(b) required there ‘would’ be an adverse effect. The Commissioner then invited the Tribunal to seek clarification from the Police if minded to ascribe any particular weight to the use of ‘may’ as opposed to ‘would’. She also suggested that the emphasis may have changed with time since the request had been made some time before the Statement. The Council also responded stating that the Statement was not intended to provide their definitive position on the possible prejudice arising from disclosure in this case. However, we had not received a substantial amount from the Council setting out its position. 30. In any event, we do not think it would be appropriate to ascribe particular weight to the use of ‘may’ instead of ‘would’. It is of course not possible to say with certainty what ‘would’ happen in the future. The standard applied in construing ‘would’ under regulation 12(5)(b), is whether it is ‘more likely than not’ that disclosure would bring the adverse effect. The use of ‘may’ in the Statement does not imply that it is not more likely than not. Having considered the matter in the round, we find that it is more likely than not that disclosure would bring the stated adverse affect EA/2016/0149 13as at the time the request was made and considered by the Council. This is for the reasons set out above. We further note that the Police emphasised the importance of the investigation being able to run its course without risk of prejudice. We have explained in paragraph 27(a) above why we consider that the trigger of risk is in itself an adverse effect. Issue B: The Balance of Public Interest 31. The Appellant has not challenged the Commissioner's approach to the balancing exercise, and has focused its arguments on whether the exception 12(5)(b) is engaged. Nevertheless, in one of its submissions, it asks the Tribunal to consider the balance of public interest. We have considered the Commissioner’s arguments, with specific reference to the material itself, based on the position at the time of the request and its consideration by the Council. 32. We accept and adopt the arguments advanced by the Commissioner. 33. We note the public interest in disclosure, based in particular on transparency. The request for information was made quite some time after the incident had occurred. There is substantial importance in understanding all aspects of it as soon as practicable. The press cuttings we have seen illustrate this. The text stated in the Manchester Evening News of 19 July 2015 (set out above), made clear that the public had been assured that all available facts would be made known. The public interest in disclosure would in part be satisfied by any future trial being held in public, with the media reporting, subject to appropriate judicial control. 34. Notwithstanding paragraph 33, the public interest in withholding the information substantially outweighs the interest in disclosure. We accept that the criminal investigation is complex and very serious. It is critical that authorities be allowed to carry it out in a focused, fair and effective manner, and the space to do so without risk of prejudice. Any future criminal trial should be allowed to run its course without risk of pre- judgment or bias on the part of the jury. 35. In conclusion, whilst there is a presumption in favour of disclosing environmental information, and the factors in favour of maintaining the exception in Regulation 12(4)(b) carry great weight and we do not consider that the factors in favour of disclosure come close to making the scales level. 36. Our Decision is unanimous. Other 37. It is also noted that the Commissioner’s reference to criminal proceedings in the Decision Notice was inaccurate as no proceedings EA/2016/0149 14have commenced. However, this does not have a material effect on the appeal. Judge Taylor 3 July 2017 Promulgated – 17 July 2017 EA/2016/0149 15"

DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 22 May 2013 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. UCAS (the Appellant) is a registered charity providing various higher education-related services to the public. The most well-known is its undergraduate applications and admissions service used by many students and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). 2. The 2nd Respondent – who made the original information requests – is author and publisher of The Good Schools Guide. -2-3. Whatever the outcome of this appeal, Lord Lucas will not have access to the information he requested. This is because the Information Commissioner (IC) and UCAS, respectively the 1st Respondent and Appellant, agree that information within the scope of one of the requests which is the subject of this appeal (Request 5) is exempt from disclosure under section 43 FOIA because it is commercially confidential and because no information was held within the scope of the other request (Request 6). 4. The two contentious issues in this appeal relate to the way in which public authorities - subsequently designated with FOIA responsibilities after the passage of the original statute and its schedules – do or do not have protection in the context of further enabling legislation and when considered in the light of the principles set out in the Supreme Court case of BBC v Sugar (No 2) [2012] UKSC 4. 5. The IC’s approach to this area in the Decision Notice is challenged, as a matter of law and principle, by UCAS. These two parties’ positions are diametrically opposed and each relies on statutory wording and BBC v Sugar (No 2) for the stance it has taken. The request for information 6. On 18 February 2012 Lord Lucas submitted five separate requests to UCAS. Only Request 5 in that series is relevant to this appeal. That was: Please could you supply me with an Excel spreadsheet (or with data in an electronic form which may readily be loaded into such a spreadsheet, such as a tab delimited file) containing the columns described below: 1. For the three academic years from 2009/10 to 2011/12 (to date) together 2. For each course at each university 1. University name 2. Course name 3. JASC code(s) for the course -3-4. Number of applications 5. Number of confirmed accepted applications Only students who were 21 or under at the beginning of the academic year when they were expected to be admitted. If data elements are missing please leave the relevant cell or column blank. Please do not summarise data - one line per student is what I am after. Please do not clean or glam up the presentation of the data. I want it in its raw form. Data may be provided in multiple tables if that requires less effort - e.g. perhaps show DCSF code, school name and postcode as lookup tables linked to the UCAS school code. 7. He made a further request on 9 March 2012 (Request 6) in the following terms: How good are schools at predicting grades: Please could you supply me with an Excel spreadsheet (or with data in an electronic form which may readily be loaded into such a spreadsheet, such as a tab delimited file) containing the columns described below: 1.

Please do not summarise data one line per examination is what I am after. Please do not clean or glam up the presentation of the data. I want it in its raw form. Data may be provided in multiple tables if that requires less effort. The complaint to the Information Commissioner -4-8. Lord Lucas contacted the IC on 22 June 2012 to complain about the UCAS' handling of requests 5 and 6. During the course of the IC’s investigation UCAS' position in relation to requests 5 and 6 shifted significantly. The IC clarified with UCAS that whilst requests 4 and 5 had been refused on the basis that the aggregated cost of complying with them exceeded the appropriate cost limit of £450, UCAS could answer request 5 on its own within the cost limit. Lord Lucas confirmed that he wished UCAS to proceed with request 5 on that basis. UCAS stated that it still considered the information sought by request 5 to be exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 43(2). 9. UCAS then explained to the IC that it had reconsidered the extent to which it believed it was subject to FOIA in accordance with the section 5 Designation Order under which it was, to a limited extent, designated a public authority. UCAS concluded that it was not a public authority in relation to the majority of the information falling within the scope of requests 5 and 6. In the alternative, if the IC concluded that - if all of the information falling within the scope of requests 5 and 6 was held by UCAS for the purposes of FOIA - then UCAS argued that in relation to request 5 the information was exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 43(1), 43(2) and 41(1). In relation to request 6, UCAS' alternative position was that providing the Information falling within the scope of the request would involve the creation of new Information, something which public authorities were not under a duty to do, and thus its position was that it did not hold the requested information. 10. In the Decision Notice the IC considered whether UCAS was a public authority for all of the information falling within the scope of requests 5 and 6. He concluded that it was. He then went on to consider UCAS’s alternative positions in respect of these requests. 11. UCAS’s submissions in respect of these issues are dealt with in greater detail in the body of the Tribunal’s decision in this appeal. -5-12. In respect of UCAS' FOIA designation, given the way in which the Designation Order was drafted, the IC agreed with the concept of the two part test as described by UCAS in determining whether any Information was held, at the time of the request, for the purposes of FOIA. The IC accepted that consideration needed to be given to what purposes UCAS holds requested Information for at the time of a request and that this involved consideration of what UCAS described as 'live' and 'historic' data. 13. The Supreme Court decision in Sugar provided both a precedent and directly relevant guidance in determining whether requested information was held by UCAS for the purposes of FOIA. Supreme Court found that if information was held by the BBC 'to any significant degree' for its derogated purposes then the information was outside the scope of FOIA, even if it was held predominantly for other, non-derogated purposes. In case of doubt, the test was 'whether there remains any sufficiently direct link between the BBC's continuing holding of the information and the achievement of its journalistic purposes' (per [104] and [106] of Sugar). 14. The IC, applying the Sugar decision to this case, believed the correct approach was to determine if there was a ‘sufficiently direct link’ between UCAS’ designated FOA function and the requested information. If there was a 'sufficiently direct link’ then the Information was held by UCAS for multiple functions as long as there remained a sufficiently direct link between the requested Information and UCAS' designated FOIA function. That remained the case even if the dominant purpose of holding the information was not for the designated purpose. That approach clearly diverged from UCAS’ position. 15. It had the potential to bring more information held by UCAS within the scope of FOIA and that included information that could be potentially – or primarily - used for UCAS’ commercial activities. It took into account, however, both the principles of the Sugar decision and the different ways -6-in which UCAS and the BBC were designated as public authorities under FOIA. It was also consistent with the IC’s position on s.3 (2) of FOIA covering when information was held by a public authority. 16. The IC believed that it was vital to note the different ways in which the BBC and UCAS were actually listed. The BBC was listed in schedule I of FOIA as a public authority but only in respect of information held for purposes other than its derogated activities. UCAS was not listed as public authority in schedule I but covered by a section 5 Designation Order but in respect on one specific function. 17. For the BBC, the impact of the applying the 'to any significant degree' test had the effect of taking considerable amounts of information outside of FOIA. 18. As long as information was used to any significant extent for the BBC's derogated functions, it fell outside of FOIA. 19. For UCAS, however, given the way it was designated as a public authority the impact of applying the 'to any significant degree' test had the effect of making considerable amounts of information potentially fall within the scope of FOIA. As long as requested information was used to any significant extent for UCAS' designated function, it fell within the scope of FOIA. 20. As a result the IC concluded that the correct test to apply when determining whether UCAS held Information for the purposes of FOIA was to consider whether there was a sufficiently direct link between the requested Information and UCAS' designated function. 21. There could still be a sufficiently direct link between the requested information and UCAS' designated function even if the immediate purpose for which that information was held was not the provision and -7-maintenance of a central applications and admissions service in respect of the institutions referenced in the Designation Order. 22. The IC was not persuaded that was reasonable or plausible to argue that as soon a particular cycle ended then all data associated with that cycle automatically became 'historic' in the manner described by UCAS. He acknowledged that UCAS had explained that the historic admissions data was not critical and necessary to delivering the current and future applications and admissions service. That did not mean that admissions data from recent years, such as that which was the focus of these requests, was not used for some element of management planning purposes in order to support the current and future implementation of the designated function. The Commissioner believed that was the case for the admissions cycles 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. 23. The provision and maintenance by UCAS of a central applications and admissions service would inevitably involve operational management decisions and the IC could not understand how UCAS could provide and maintain such a complex administrative system without taking such operational decisions. He did not accept that UCAS provided and maintained the application and admissions service for each live cycle in some sort of vacuum that was in no way influenced or guided by the data for cycles from recent years. 24. As a consequence the IC determined that all of the information falling within the scope of requests 5 and 6 met the first limb of the two stage test. For the Information for the academic years 2009/10, 2010/11and 2011/12 that was because although such information is no longer held for the immediate purpose of fulfilling the UCAS' designated function there remained a significant link between this information and UCAS' designated function. -8-25. The IC then considered, in sequence, whether under FOIA UCAS was under a duty to disclose such Information in respect of request 5 and request 6. 26. In request of request 5 he concluded that UCAS could rely on s.43 (2) as the basis not to disclose the withheld information. 27. In respect of request 6 he concluded that UCAS did not hold the information because providing it would require the creation of new information, something UCAS was not obliged to do under FOIA. The Legal Framework 28. Section 1 FOIA provides: General right of access to information held by public authorities. (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. 29. Section 2 FOIA provides: Effect of the exemptions in Part II. …. (2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 30. Section 3 FOIA addresses the definition of “public authority” Public authorities. (1) In this Act “public authority” means— (a) subject to section 4(4), any body which, any other person who, or the holder of any office which— (i) is listed in Schedule 1, or -9-(ii) is designated by order under section 5, or (b) a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6. 31. Section 5 FOIA provides: Further power to designate public authorities. (1)The Secretary of State may by order designate as a public authority for the purposes of this Act any person who is neither listed in Schedule 1 nor capable of being added to that Schedule by an order under section 4(1), but who— (a) appears to the Secretary of State to exercise functions of a public nature, or (b) is providing under a contract made with a public authority any service whose provision is a function of that authority. (2) An order under this section may designate a specified person or office or persons or offices falling within a specified description. (3) Before making an order under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult every person to whom the order relates, or persons appearing to him to represent such persons. (4) This section has effect subject to section 80. 32. Section 7 FOIA provides: Public authorities to which Act has limited application. …. (5) An order under section 5(1)(a) must specify the functions of the public authority designated by the order with respect to which the designation is to have effect; and nothing in Parts I to V of this Act applies to information which is held by the authority but does not relate to the exercise of those functions. 33. By virtue of The Freedom of Information (Designation as Public Authorities) Order 2011 (SI 2011 No. 2598) UCAS is designated as a public authority for: The provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service in relation to: a) an institution listed in paragraphs 53(1)(a) to (e) and 55(1)(a) and (b) of Part 4 of Schedule 1 to the Freedom of Information Act 2000(e); b) an institution listed in Part 5 of Schedule 1 to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002(f); c) the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise. - 10 -Grounds of Appeal 34. The Appellant’s Ground of Appeal are as follows: (1) The IC misdirected himself as to the test to be applied as to whether the Information falls within the scope of FOIA. (2) The IC consequently erred in finding that the section 1 (1) obligation applied to UCAS in respect of information held for the dominant purpose of UCAS's non-designated (commercial) functions. (3) The IC failed to apply the correct test. (4) The IC erred in deciding that the historical admissions cycle data requested were used for management planning purposes of the designated function. Evidence 35. We heard detailed evidence from Mary Curnock Cook, the Chief Executive of UCAS and Dr Mark Corver, Head of Analysis and Research (the policy and research unit of UCAS) in respect of the 650,000/700,000 undergraduate applications processed by UCAS during an average year. 36. They adopted their written witness statements, gave oral evidence, were cross-examined and answered questions from the Tribunal. 37. The effect of that evidence is dealt with in the Conclusions section below. Submissions on the Grounds of Appeal 38. The IC’s submissions followed, in greater detail, the positions adopted and arguments used in his 28-page, 113 Paragraph Decision Notice – which is publicly available - and will not be repeated. 39. UCAS contended that, under the Designation Order, when information was requested from it, then the correct approach required a two-stage test to be applied to determine whether the information was potentially within the scope of the Designation Order. Namely: (a) Was UCAS exercising its designated function i.e. was the information held for the provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service? - 11 -(b) Was UCAS doing so in relation to specific institutions which were cited in the Designation Order? 40. If that two-stage test was satisfied, was the relevant information also held to a significant extent for some other (commercial) purpose which is outside the designation? If so, was the immediate object - or direct purpose - of UCAS's holding the information related to UCAS's non- designated (commercial) activities? If the answer to that was “yes”, then the information did not fall within the scope of FOIA. 41. That analysis gave effect to the statutory purpose of the legislation and was consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Sugar. 42. When interpreting the Designation Order, the starting point should focus on the normal meaning, derived from the words that the Parliamentary draughtsman had chosen to use. However, the intention of the legislator was of paramount importance when ascertaining the meaning of the statutory provisions. See A-G's Reference (No 5 of 2002) [2005] I AC at [31]: No explanation for resorting to a purposive construction is necessary. One can confidently assume that Parliament intends its legislation to be interpreted not in the way of a black-letter lawyer, but in a meaningful and purposeful way giving effect to the basic objectives of the legislation. 43. In Sugar, the Supreme Court strongly endorsed that purposive approach (see [63] per Lord Phillips - ""The answer to the issue must lie in adopting a purposive approach to the definition""). 44. In Sugar, the BBC was listed as a public authority in Part VI of Schedule 1 to FOIA. Part VI provided that as regards the BBC, FOIA applies ""in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature."" The Supreme Court was concerned with the question of how widely or narrowly the phrase ''purposes other than those of journalism"" were to be construed. It held that, having regard to the language and legislative purpose of FOIA, information that was held by the BBC to any significant degree for the purposes of journalism was not ""held for - 12 -purposes other than those of journalism"" within the meaning of Part VI Schedule 1 - even if, as a matter of fact, that information was also held for other, possibly more significant purposes. Therefore that information was exempt from production under FOIA. 45. The Supreme Court also held that, in determining whether information was held by the BBC for those purposes, consideration should be given to whether there remained any sufficiently direct link between the continued holding of the information and the achievement of its journalistic purposes. 46. The ratio of Sugar, UCAS maintained, was that information held for the excluded purpose (journalism in that instance) should be protected and not made subject to the obligations imposed by FOIA - even if that information was also held for other, non-excluded purposes, and even if those other non-excluded purposes were more significant. 47. Sugar meant that the legislative purpose of the protection was to prevent interference with the performance of the excluded functions. Accordingly – UCAS’s argument ran - statutory definition was to be construed purposively to prevent disclosure of information when this would risk interference with those excluded functions (Lord Phillips, [64-65]). 48. Although the wording of the Designation Order was different from the wording of the BBC's 'designation', the Designation Order bringing UCAS into the FOIA regime needed to be construed purposively, to prevent disclosure of information when this would risk interference with UCAS's excluded (commercial) functions. Although the wording of the Order was different, both designations had the same substantive focus, in that they set out the information in respect of which FOIA will apply - in the case of the BBC, by reference to information held for purposes other than those of journalism etc. In UCAS's case, while the structure of FOIA (and in particular Schedule I) meant that the BBC would be presumptively subject to FOIA in all respects but for the qualification set out in Schedule I, UCAS was one of only three entities - 13 -that had, exceptionally, been made subject to FOIA only as regards specific functions. 49. In Sugar, the qualifications to the right to information under FOIA were as significant as the rights to the information (Lord Walker [77]). Here the exclusion from the scope of FOIA should be accorded just as much significance as the right to the information that did fall within the scope of the Designation Order. So Sugar - as applied to this Appeal and to the Designation Order - resulted in the information which UCAS held for excluded (commercial) functions or purposes having similar protection (i.e. not made subject to the obligations imposed by FOIA). That case even where that information was also held for other, non-excluded, functions or purposes, and even if those other non-excluded functions or purposes were more significant. 50. It also gave effect to section 7 (5) FOIA which clearly demonstrated that Parliament's intention was only to extend the obligations imposed by FOIA to organisations that were made the subject of an Order under section 5, to the strictly limited extent set out in the Order. 51. It was still open to UCAS to disclose the information if it considered it appropriate to do so. The advantage of that approach was that it provided protection to “commercial” information while leaving it open for such information to be disclosed where that was appropriate. 52. In the alternative, UCAS maintained that, if the test was not as argued to this point, then a 'dominant purpose' test operated. Was the dominant purpose for which the information was held the function for which UCAS was designated under the Designation Order or was it some other (commercial) purpose or function? If it was the latter, the information fell outside the scope of FOIA. UCAS accepted the ‘dominant purpose’ test had not been accepted in Sugar but – in that case - the Supreme Court had been considering a different exclusion. It was open to the Tribunal to distinguish Sugar in this different situation and to hold that the dominant purpose test was the correct one in this case. - 14 -53. In respect of the fourth and final Ground of Appeal – that the IC erred in deciding that all historical admissions cycle data requested were used for management planning purposes of the designated function – that matter was addressed in the witness statement of Dr Corver. 54. He had explained that historical admissions cycle data were used only in the ‘analytical’ function, and not in the ‘apply’ function - with very limited exceptions. Although certain analysis conducted from historical admissions cycle data was used to a very limited extent in providing context for management planning for future live cycles, such analysis was based on summary published statistics or trends i.e. previously published historical data and the use of such data is not a necessity. The historical admissions cycle data at the level requested by Lord Lucas in Requests 5 and 6 played no part in planning or operational decision making in the core applications and admissions service. He had stated that, although historical admissions cycle data might be looked at in order to form a view on what UCAS's IT systems might need to be able to cope with on A level results day in the next live cycle, this was historical data at a much more aggregated or summary level than that sought by Lord Lucas. It did not correspond in any way to the historical admissions cycle information actually sought by him. 55. UCAS did not hold data in the form requested by Lord Lucas in Request 5, even for that part of the request that might arguably have related to live cycle data. For Request 6, UCAS did not hold that type of information on its operational database. Significantly, there would be no need to look at data in that form for the purposes of the ‘apply’ function. Considerable time and effort were required to convert the data when they were transferred from the operational database to the analytical database. Conclusions 56. There was no dispute that UCAS falls within the scope of FOIA in relation to the Institutions set out in paragraphs 53 and 55 of Schedule I to FOIA only. This means that a FOIA request could be made to UCAS - 15 -for information which could otherwise be sought, under FOIA, from the individual institutions. It was common ground that a significant majority of institutions for which UCAS provided services were caught by Paragraphs 53 and 55. 57. The first part of our determination in this appeal relates to the correct test to be used when considering whether information held by UCAS falls within the scope of the 2011 Designation Order and, as a consequence, FOIA. As was mentioned in the introduction, the Supreme Court decision in Sugar is relied on as the primary beacon of guidance and authority on the test to be applied when considering the scope of FOIA in respect of bodies which are partly designated and partly excluded. 58. Historically the BBC and UCAS feature in FOIA at different stages of the life of the Act. The BBC’s “derogation” in Schedule I, Part VI FOIA was won after significant representations were made on its behalf during the passage of the original Bill on to the statute book. The issue that was ultimately protected in that “derogation” when it became law – information held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature – applied equally to other public service broadcasters like Channel 4 and S4C. UCAS’ designation comes in Statutory Instrument 2011 No.2598 in the form of The Freedom of Information (Designation as Public Authorities) Order 2011 made on 31 October 2011. The two bodies designated as Public Authorities in that order – apart from UCAS - were The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO) and The Financial Ombudsman Service Limited (FOS). 59. It will be noted that issues of journalism, art or literature did not feature in any of these three 2011 designations. 60. In our view this creates, from the start, a different and distinctive divide between Sugar in its BBC (and journalism, art or literature) context and the interpretation which should properly derived from the Supreme Court’s Sugar decision when considered in respect of UCAS’s position. - 16 -61. It is the difference between public broadcasters being given the space provided by the “derogation” to get on with their duties dealing with issues of journalism, art or literature as unencumbered by the effect of the Act as is appropriate and UCAS being brought into the body of Public Authorities which now have certain carefully defined duties and protective exclusions under an Act whose primary focus is in its name, the Freedom of Information Act. 62. In Sugar the Supreme Court considered the nature of the test for determining 'the scope of the BBC exception”. By a majority of 4-1, the Court applied a test that if the information was held to any significant degree for the purposes of journalism then it was not held for purposes other than journalism, even if it was held for other, possibly more important, purposes. Consideration needed to be given to whether there remained any sufficiently direct link between the continuing holding of the information and the achievement of the journalistic purposes.1 63. Information held by UCAS falls into one of two categories. It is either in no way held in relation to the Designated Function, or it is held in relation to the Designated Function even if it is also held in relation to other (possibly more important) functions. The sequence for applying Sugar, is as follows: (1) Is the information held by UCAS to any significant degree (not de minimis) in relation to the exercise of the Designated Function, even if it is also held in relation to other (possibly more important) functions? Where there is doubt over the degree to which it is held, the relevant question is whether there is a sufficiently direct link, sufficient proximity, between the holding of the information and the exercise of the Designated Function. (2) If yes, is the information held in relation to a listed institution within the meaning of the 2011 Order? If yes, then information falls within the scope of FOIA. 1 Lord Brown [104], Lord Phillips [67] and [75] Lord Walker. - 17 -(3) Does an exemption within Part I or II of FOIA apply? 64. We agree with the IC’s consistently-held position that he has correctly applied the Sugar test to UCAS and not turned the Supreme Court’s decision on its head. UCAS’ position is the reverse of the BBC. The BBC is designated as a public authority in relation to all of its functions, except for those exempted by the wording of its designation in Schedule I. UCAS is not designated as a public authority generally, except for the functions included by the wording of its designation in the 2011 Order. 65. The starting points of the two bodies are manifestly different. The focus of construction is on the specific words. The purpose of those specific words is different. The focus of the phase ""for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature” is on what is not caught by FOIA. The purpose of that wording is to exclude information. 66. The focus of the phrase ""the provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service"", taken with section 7(5) FOIA, is on what is actually caught by FOIA and the purpose of that wording is specifically to include information. 67. That construction reflects the wording of section 7(5) of FOIA, which only excludes “information which is held by the authority but does not relate to the exercise of those [designated] functions"". The focus is on the express inclusion, not the implicit exclusion. There is no Sugar-significant relationship between the information and the Designated Function. The wording is different to that in the Sugar case, where the question revolved around the purpose for which the information was held. 68. This applies a purposive construction to the provision. The primary purpose of the 2011 Order was to bring UCAS within the scope of FOIA and subject it to the principles of greater openness and transparency that such a designation was designed to bring. UCAS was being made subject to FOIA for the first time. Nowhere in the 2011 Designation Order does the word “commercial” appear. - 18 -69. The passages from Hansard relied on by UCAS cannot bear the weight the Tribunal is urged to place on them. The two Ministers, in their respective Houses, stated that “UCAS’s other commercial functions can be seen as distinct from the central applications services that it provides and are not considered to be functions of a public nature"". They did not purport to prescribe an approach to be taken in respect of information which is held partly for the Designated Function and partly (even predominantly) for another commercial function. 70. It is clear that UCAS has commercial functions and that they are not caught by the 2011 Order. Nor is information held solely for those functions caught by FOIA. However the 2011 Designation Order sought to bring the admissions function of UCAS within the scope of FOIA in relation to information which UCAS held in respect of institutions who were themselves already subject to FOIA. The designation of UCAS assists requestors in obtaining information relating to the Designated Function from a single source, rather than having to make individual requests to a whole series of individual higher education institutions. 71. Most persuasive is the IC’s point that, in construing the scope of the 2011 Designation Order, it is important to recall that Parliament would have been well aware of the existing exemptions provided in FOIA. There is no need to read the 2011 Designation Order narrowly to ensure there is no overlap with a commercial function of UCAS because section 43 FOIA itself provides protection to UCAS in relation to information which prejudices its commercial interests. 72. The approach of UCAS in this case would have the result that only admissions data relating to the currently live admissions round would fall within the scope of FOIA. This surprisingly narrow result is unlikely to have been the one intended by Parliament when designating UCAS as a public authority for FOIA, not least because the '""provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service"" does not suggest such an outcome. - 19 -73. The Tribunal declines UCAS’ suggestion that it adopts the “predominant purpose” test that failed before the 4 – 1 majority in the Supreme Court. 74. In relation to the Historic Disputed Information the Tribunal finds that it is unlikely that the applications and admissions service for each live cycle is carried out in a vacuum that is in no way influenced or guided by the data for cycles from recent years despite the written and oral evidence of the two witnesses. It is difficult to see how the Historic Disputed Information does not relate to the Designated Function, in the sense of being connected with or arising out of it. 75. The evidence from UCAS is that its functions fall into four types: “inform” (providing information about courses); “search” (searching for courses on a database); “apply” (the admissions process); and “analytical” (analysis on data collected from the apply function). The Designated Function is the ""provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service"". Clearly this encompasses the “apply” function. It is difficult to see how information held for the “inform'” and “search” functions is not also closely related to the carrying out of the Designated Function. A key aspect of a central applications and admissions service is that people who wish to use it can adequately search it for what it may encompass, and are provided information about how it works and the way that it works. The approach of UCAS to the scope of FOIA is unduly narrow. It is difficult to see how UCAS can “maintain” the service without having access to data collected from historic admissions cycles. 76. We find, considering the evidence in the round, that the Historic Disputed Information relates to some significant degree and not de minimis to the Designated Function. There is a sufficiently direct link, sufficient proximity, between the information and the '""provision and maintenance of a central applications and admissions service"" to engage FOIA as applied by the Designation Order. A test based on the purposes to which UCAS itself currently applies the information, whether for example it uses the historic information to inform management decisions to a greater or lesser extent, - 20 -is not determinative because the ""held for"" construction is not used in the Designation Order. Although the information is also held for commercial purposes, there is no general exclusion for information relating to commercial purposes in the Order, as there is for the journalistic and other purposes of the BBC in the terms of its partial designation. Any protection for UCAS' commercial functions falls to be provided (as for any other body within FOIA) through the application of relevant exemptions in Part II of FOIA. The Information Commissioner's application of such exemptions in order to avoid disclosure which would injure commercial interests of UCAS is the correct approach. We do not accept UCAS' submissions that the difference in the form of words used in the BBC partial exclusion from FOIA, and the UCAS partial inclusion through designation is immaterial. In practical terms, an interpretation of the provisions which excludes all requests relating to a closed admissions round is likely to be unduly restrictive. We see no justification for this either in the terms of the Designation Order, or the explanatory and Parliamentary material drawn to our attention. 77. It would be open – but laborious – for Lord Lucas (or any individual at any specific school) to seek the Historic Disputed Information from the individual institutions under FOIA. That such information could not be sought from UCAS as the central service provider seems to the Tribunal to be an artificial construction and erroneous conclusion. 78. Because the information within the scope of request 5 is exempt from disclosure by virtue of s.43 FOIA and no information is held in respect of request 6 the information is either not at risk or not with scope of the request. 79. The Tribunal has applied the balance of probabilities as the standard of proof in this appeal. 80. For all the reasons set out above the Appellant’s appeal fails. 81. Our decision is unanimous. - 21 -82. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 15 January 2013 - 22 -"

Subject matter: Whether the Appellant’s request was vexatious for the purposes of FOIA s.14 Cases: Dransfield v ICO and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440 1DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal dismisses the appeal. Dated this 13th day of February, 2015 David Farrer Q.C. Judge [Signed on original] The Decision Introduction 1. At and for a considerable time before she made the request which gives rise to this appeal, MC was a British Horse Society county access officer for Hampshire. For many years, in dialogue and correspondence with the county council (“HCC”), she promoted public rights of way, particularly riders’ access to the countryside. 2. With others, she had particular concerns as to ownership of and access to Brox- head Common, part of which had been fenced off many years ago by the land- owner. MC has strong views as to the legal status of the common and the re- moval of some eighty acres from registration by order of the Court in 1975. HCC reported thirty - one communications from her on the subject of Broxhead Com- mon in seven years together with a further twenty - six from persons who, HCC believes, have links with her. She apparently sustained continuous exchanges as to Broxhead with HCC for around twenty years leading up to the request. In a let- ter of 15th. March, 2012 HCC stated that her demands on the Countryside Team 2were unreasonable and were affecting the quality of its service to others. In a fur- ther letter dated 31st. October, 2012, responding to questions as to the removal of the eighty acres from the Register and the lack of any application to fence them, the HCC Head of Information Compliance, Judith Downing, referred to the strain that such continuing inquiries placed upon its resources and indicated that it would treat further communications of the same nature on the same issues as unreasonable and respond accordingly. 3. MC also contributed to a website which vigorously publicised the issue of Brox- head Common. She applied to the Land Registry to alter its records as to title to the eighty acres and lodged a complaint against it when it declined to do so. The Independent Complaints Reviewer rejected her complaint and provided a very full report setting out her conclusions. This was completed in September 2014, nearly a year after the request. MC also contacted the Rural Payments Agency and DEFRA on the same subject as well as her MP. The Request 4. By e mail of 29th. October, 2013 MC made the following request - “Please will you send me a list of those who make up Area Team North? In fact a pro forma of who does what in the Countryside Department of HCC would be most useful so perhaps it could be included as part of the whole”. 5. On 6th. January, 2014, long past the date for its response, as noted in the Deci- sion Notice, HCC sent MC a detailed structure chart showing the different roles in the North Area Team and Countryside Department. MC immediately asked for the names of team members since only their functions were specified. Judith Downing replied on 31st January, 2014, referred at length to the extent and self - generating nature of previous correspondence from MC and stated that HCC treated her request, specifically in so far as it required names, as vexatious, in accordance with s.14. She indicated that HCC would not respond to correspon- 3dence on the same topics which raised no new point. HCC later declined to per- form an internal review of the decision to treat the renewed request as vexatious. The Complaint to the ICO 6. MC complained to the ICO on 18th. February, 2014, suggesting that HCC was covering up a criminal offence relating to the removal of the eighty acres from registration and supplied false information. She asked the casework team to in- vestigate the matter. She accused HCC of issuing threats regarding vexatious behaviour. Her complaint was evidently and properly treated as a complaint as to the treatment of her request of 29th. October, 2011 as vexatious. The Decision Notice (“the DN”) 7. The ICO stated that this complaint fell under FOIA s.14 rather than reg.12(4)(b) of the Environmental Information Regulations, 2004. The Tribunal agrees; the names of county council staff are not environmental information as defined in reg. 2(1). 8. He reviewed HCC’s account of its dealings with MC over the previous twenty years (the frequency and general content of which MC does not contradict). They were clearly and extensively set out in a letter of 13th. June, 2014 from Judith Downing to the ICO, to which was attached a spreadsheet of MC’s contacts with HCC, together with those of others thought to be collaborating with her. The ICO referred specifically to the Broxhead Common exchanges and concluded that any continuing dispute on the status of the Common could only be resolved by further order of the Court. He considered HCC’s interpretation of MC’s purpose, namely to enable her to address future representations to particular members of the countryside team. He concluded that HCC had correctly treated the request as vexatious. 4The Appeal 9. MC appealed on several grounds. She stated that HCC formerly provided the type of information requested to volunteers like herself. Prior to the request she had not corresponded with HCC since exchanges in February and October, 2012. The ICO was wrong to associate her request with previous inquiries re- garding Broxhead Common and asserted that she had no need of such further inquiries since she was better informed on this subject than either senior or junior HCC staff. She needed to address junior officers in her role acting for the British Horse Society. She surmised an “ulterior motive” in HCC’s response to her re- quest, which was proportionate and could not properly be characterised as vexa- tious. In belittling the public interest in this request the ICO, quite mistakenly, linked Broxhead Common to the request. It had “nothing to do with it”. She em- phasised that she had all the information that she needed on that subject. Our Reasons 10. We are guided in our decision by the approach indicated in Dransfield v ICO and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440. The Tribunal is aware that the Court of Appeal has recently considered Dransfield and will in due course give judgment upon it. However, its authority binds the Tribunal unless or until it is overturned and we apply its guidance to the determination of this appeal. 11. Our starting point is the nature of the request, which, viewed in isolation, appears a modest and quite reasonable inquiry, albeit one of very limited value to the pub- lic. Given the comprehensive picture of the structure of the various teams and partnerships provided by HCC in response to MC’s request, it is far from obvious why she or any other inquirer should need to know the name of a fairly junior in- dividual member of staff, as distinct from the role which each performed. A rea- sonable inquiry can be addressed to an office even if the name of the holder is unknown. Moreover, the officers concerned were not those designated to answer 5public requests for information. HCC’s belief as to the purpose of the request is perfectly plausible, though we make no finding as to its correctness. 12. Such a request cannot, however, be viewed in isolation, given the previous his- tory of correspondence and the relentless and repetitive pursuit by MC of ques- tions of countryside access, particularly, of the issue of the eighty acres removed from Broxhead Common, as to which HCC, whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter, could plainly add nothing to what it had already said. 13. MC’s protestation that the request had nothing to do with Broxhead Common is hard to accept. When requesting an internal review of the decision of HCC con- veyed on 31st. January, 2014, she referred expressly to alleged failures to an- swer questions as to Broxhead Common (paragraph 6) and to false representa- tions as to the facts with regard to Broxhead Common amounting, in her opinion to “no less than criminal fraud” (paragraph 14). Further, her complaint to the ICO following the refusal of an internal review, requested an investigation into a cover – up of a criminal offence involving the removal of the eighty acres from the regis- ter. The Tribunal considers that HCC was entitled to regard an apparently inde- pendent request for names as part and parcel of the Broxhead Common cam- paign. 14. It is apparent that no useful purpose could be served by persisting in sterile ar- guments to which HCC’s response had long been clear. If there was a case to bring, then it must be for a court to resolve it. The seemingly endless emails and letters to HCC had no practical value but were disproportionate and unreason- able. The modest pause before the request does not alter that assessment. 15. HCC argues that they placed an unreasonable burden upon it to the detriment of other members of the public seeking the assistance of the Countryside Depart- ment (to use a compendious term). The Tribunal accepts that this is probably cor- 6rect. We take account of the sheer length of the correspondence, as carefully logged by HCC. 16. This is not a case in which the requests or other approaches by MC involved per- sonal invective but the repeated, wholly irrational and forensically nonsensical accusation of theft and fraud by HCC does not assist her appeal. 17. We take no account of correspondence from others said to be linked to MC. Her personal contribution to the burden on HCC was highly significant by itself. Our Decision 18. We have no doubt that HCC was justified in its reliance on s.14. This request, viewed in its proper context, was vexatious, taking the overall view of the matter advocated in Dransfield. 19. We therefore dismiss this appeal. 20. Our decision is unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 13th. February, 2015. 7"
"371","FOI","Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 Information Commissioner’s Ref: FS50190964 Heard at Procession House, London, EC4 Decision Promulgated On: 8 January 2010 On: 13 January 2010 BEFORE CHAIRMAN MELANIE CARTER and LAY MEMBERS GARETH JONES STEVE SHAW Between ROGER GALL Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Subject matter: Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005 as amended Time limit for appealing, Rule 5 Application for striking out, Rule 9 Amendment and supplementary grounds, Rule 11 Cases: Bennett v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0033 1Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 Decision on the papers The Tribunal grants the application of the Information Commissioner and this Appeal is struck out under Rule 9 of the Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005. Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This appeal concerns the Appellant’s long running correspondence with Weymouth and Portland Borough Council (the “Council”) on the Council’s discretionary exercise of its licensing policy. In the course of this correspondence he made a series of requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 2. The Appellant made two complaints to the Information Commissioner (IC) under section 50 of FOIA the first dated 15 January 2008 (reference number FS50189399) and the second dated 28 January 2008, (reference number FS50190964). This appeal concerns the Decision Notice issued in relation to the latter complaint. 3. The first complaint (FS50189399) concerned the Council’s application of section 40(2) of FOIA (exemption for personal data) to information the Appellant had requested. That complaint was closed by the Commissioner without issuing a Decision Notice, and the Appellant was advised of this in writing on 8 February 2008. 4. On 8 December 2007 the Appellant wrote to the Council, making a number of requests regarding the Council’s Draft Statement of Licensing Policy. Between then and 18 January 2008 the Appellant wrote to the Council on number of occasions raising further questions. 5. On 23 January 2008 the Council wrote to the Appellant stating that it would not be responding to any further correspondence from the Appellant in relation to licensing 2Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 issues, on the basis that they deemed his repeated requests to be vexatious. The Council relied upon section 14 of FOIA. The Appellant complained to the IC on 28 January 2008 (FS50190964). The Commissioner’s Decision 6. Following an investigation, the IC served a Decision Notice dated 13 August 2009. 7. The Commissioner found that certain of the information requested was environmental in nature and therefore fell to be considered under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). He upheld the decision of the Council that section 14(1) of FOIA and Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR applied. The appeal to the Tribunal 8. The Appellant appealed the Decision Notice on an undated form, received by the Tribunal Office on 7 September 2009. This was, therefore, received within the 28 day time limit (that is 28 days of the date of the Decision Notice 13 August 2009). The Appellant ticked the box on the form requesting the Tribunal to consider an out of time appeal but did not set out any reasons for this request (the form specifically asks for the “special circumstances”). It was accompanied by a letter dated 4 September 2009 in which the Appellant stated that he realised that he had 28 days to serve a notice of appeal but was not aware that he would be expected to supply his full case at the same time that the Notice was served. He stated that “he had spent much of this time trying to obtain some legal representation for this appeal. The position as regards whether this will be possible is still unclear. As a result, I am not able to supply details of this or supply the full grounds of my appeal and supporting documents before expiry of this date and to do so at this stage may prejudice my appeal.” He requested an extended period within which to present his appeal. 9. The Appellant left blank the part of the form given for setting out the grounds of appeal. The Appellant sent with the form, a series of documents consisting of one letter from the Appellant to the ICO dated 17 August 2009 which related to the closed case 3Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 FS50189399, and a series of email exchanges between the Appellant and the Council in 2007. 10. In the IC’s reply the Tribunal was asked to consider striking out the appeal under rule 9 of the Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005 (“the 2005 Rules”) on the basis that the Notice of Appeal did not disclose a reasonable ground of appeal. 11. On 16th October 2009, the Chairwoman issued directions stating that unless either party objected there would not be a preliminary hearing and that the Tribunal would meet in private to consider the strike out application. The Appellant was given 7 days to request a directions hearing and two weeks to provide written submissions why his appeal ought not to be struck out. 12. By a letter dated 19 October 2009, the Appellant wrote to the Tribunal Office to request a preliminary hearing and that “my obviously incomplete application form be held or returned but that my Appeal is not to be struck out as a result of this misunderstanding? My intention would be to submit a correctly completed application form as soon as a proper case can be made and trust that you would be willing to hear this case at that point”. He enclosed with this, a letter from a solicitor’s firm showing that as at that date, the Appellant had been trying to obtain pro bono legal assistance. 13. Following a telephone directions hearing on 10 November 2009, the Chairwoman issued directions providing a deadline for the Appellant to make an application to amend his notice appeal “including reasons why the Tribunal should accept the late amendments” and the particular grounds of appeal he wished to add. 14. The Appellant made his application to amend the Notice of Appeal by a letter dated 22 November 2009. 4Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 The relevant law 15. Rule 4 of the Rules provide, in so far as is relevant to this appeal: “Method of appealing - notice of appeal 4. - (1) An appeal must be brought by a written notice of appeal served on the Tribunal. (2) The notice of appeal shall - (a) identify the disputed decision and the date on which the notice relating to the disputed decision was served on or given to the appellant; and (b) state - (i) the name and address of the appellant; (ii) the grounds of the appeal; (iii)… (iv)… (v) where applicable, the special circumstances which the appellant considers justify the Tribunal's accepting jurisdiction under rule 5(2) below1; and (c) be signed by or on behalf of the appellant. (3)… (4) A notice of appeal may include a request for an early determination of the appeal and the reasons for that request.” 16. Rule 5(2) permits the Tribunal to accept an appeal out of time where it is of the opinion that “by reason of special circumstances it is be just and right to do so”. 17. Rule 9 of the 2005 Rules provides: “9. (1) ……. where the Commissioner is of the opinion that an appeal does not lie to, or cannot be entertained by, the Tribunal, or that the notice of appeal 5Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 discloses no reasonable grounds of appeal, he may include in his reply under Rule 8(2) above a notice to that effect stating the grounds for such contention and applying for the appeal to be struck out. “ 18. There is little guidance provided for the Tribunal on the circumstances in which it will be appropriate to strike out an appeal under Rule 9. We have adopted the approach taken by a differently constituted panel of this Tribunal in the case of Bennett v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0033 which stated that: “We consider that the language used in Rule 9 is unambiguous. A reasonable ground of appeal is one that is readily identifiable from the Notice of Appeal, relates to an issue the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide and is realistic not fanciful.” 19. Rule 11(1) provides that “with the leave of the Tribunal, the appellant may amend his notice of appeal or deliver supplementary grounds of appeal.” 20. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction on appeal is governed by section 58 of FOIA. As it applies to this matter it entitles the Tribunal to allow the Appeal if it considers that the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law or, to the extent that it involved an exercise of discretion, the IC ought to have exercised his discretion differently. 21. The starting point for the Tribunal is the Decision Notice of the Commissioner but the Tribunal also receives evidence, which is not limited to the material that was before the Commissioner. The Tribunal, having considered the evidence (and it is not bound by strict rules of evidence), may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner and consider the Decision Notice is not in accordance with the law because of those different facts. The questions for the Tribunal 22. The first question for the Tribunal was whether to allow the Appellant’s application to amend the Notice of Appeal. 6Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 23. If allowed, the Tribunal would have needed to adjourn to allow the ICO time to submit replies to the new grounds of appeal. 24. If the Tribunal declined the application to amend the Notice of Appeal its task then was to consider whether to strike out the appeal under rule 9 on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable ground of appeal. Consideration 25. The first question as indicated above, is whether to allow the Appellant, under rule 11(1), to amend his Notice of Appeal, or as the rule goes on to provide, “to deliver supplementary grounds of appeal”. The IC argues that as there are no grounds of appeal contained within the original Notice of Appeal, the Rules do not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to permit delivery of new grounds of appeal. It is argued that given the particular phrasing of rule 11(1), that is, split into either the amending of the Notice of Appeal or the “delivery of supplementary grounds of appeal”, the Tribunal does not have the power to allow the amendment of the Notice of Appeal by way of adding grounds of appeal where previously there were none. Only “supplementary grounds of appeal” may be added, not what would in effect be the late delivery of any grounds of appeal. The IC points out that the Rules do not provide for the protective serving of a Notice of Appeal simply to preserve an Appellant’s position with regard to the time limit. 26. The Tribunal is instead invited by the IC to consider this application as an application for an appeal out of time under rule 5(2). The Tribunal would then have to consider whether there were “special circumstances, pursuant to rule 5(2) which would mean that it was “just and right” to allow the appeal to be lodged out of time. The Tribunal was concerned however that the Rules would not permit this alternative route as the Appellant had lodged an appeal within the 28 day time limit. Short of that appeal being formally withdrawn under rule 12, the Tribunal could not see how it could treat the proposed new grounds as, in effect, a new appeal albeit out of time. 27. The Tribunal considered that the Appellant had set out to commence the appeal process within the prescribed time limit. He had not had the benefit of legal advice and was a litigant in person. As such, the Tribunal was anxious to ensure that his appeal was not excluded on a procedural technicality without his having the 7Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 opportunity to rectify matters. In the event, the Chairwoman had acceded to the Appellant’s request for a preliminary hearing and had then provided time for him to make an application for amendment of the Notice of Appeal and in particular to provide the reasons why the Tribunal should grant the application. 28. The Tribunal considered that its broad discretion whether or not to allow an amendment to the Notice of Appeal under rule 11(2), whilst not cast in the same way as rule 5(2), would allow consideration of the same factors. Essentially, it all came down to the time taken by the Appellant to seek and then fail to find legal representation. 29. It was not necessary for the Tribunal to determine the legal arguments put forward by the IC in paragraph 25 above, as it did not consider the reasons given for the late steps taken by the Appellant warranted the exercise of the discretion under rule 11(1). Nor was it of the view that, had it been considering a late Notice of Appeal and an application for this to proceed out of time, this would amount to “special circumstances” under rule 5(2). As such, whichever way this was looked at and whatever the correct interpretation of the Rules, the Tribunal would not have allowed the new grounds of appeal to be considered. Its reasons for not accepting the Appellant’s explanation for the delays were informed by the fact that time taken to obtain legal representation is not normally considered a sufficient excuse by the courts for missing a deadline. This Tribunal entertains appeals from many litigants in person who have conduct of their cases, without the benefit of legal advice, from Notice of Appeal through to hearing. 30. The Appellant had the chance further to the second set of directions to provide his reasons for seeking amendment of the Notice of Appeal. His response was again that he had been seeking legal representation, that he had now accepted that this was not possible and would be acting as a litigant in person. This had been his opportunity to set out the steps he had taken, how long the steps had taken and whether any of this delay had been attributable to third parties. By the time the new grounds had been provided to the Tribunal, it was just over 3 months from the date of the Decision Notice. The Tribunal might have looked sympathetically had there been information and evidence before it that the Appellant had made significant efforts and/or had been caught up in dealing with others whom had contributed to the 8Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 delays. The Tribunal did not have sufficient information before it to warrant exercise of the discretion to allow a late amendment of the Notice of Appeal. 31. There was an important public interest enshrined in the imposition of appeal deadlines. Without these public authorities would not be able to draw a line under their decisions and move resources on to other public functions. There needed to be a reliable degree of finality in legal affairs so as to facilitate the proper functioning of a public authority. This was a fundamental aspect of the rule of law and fairness to all parties. 32. Thus, the next question for the Tribunal was to consider the IC’s application for the appeal to be struck out on the basis that the Notice of Appeal did not disclose any reasonable grounds of appeal. Given the decision above not to allow a late amendment of the Notice of Appeal, the Tribunal was only considering the Notice of Appeal and documents supplied with it. The Tribunal noted that the form did not include any grounds at all. The accompanying documents evidenced the original letters of request and certain of the Council’s responses. The only letter accompanying the form which might be said to have included sufficient to amount to a ground of appeal was the one referring to case number FS50189399. That case was closed without a Decision Notice and was a matter therefore which lay outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see paragraph…. above). Thus, there were no grounds of appeal at all included within the Notice of Appeal and accordingly, the Tribunal decided to strike the appeal out under rule 9. Conclusion and remedy 33. The Tribunal decided not to allow a late amendment of the Notice of Appeal and to strike out the appeal under rule 9. 34. Our decision is unanimous. 9Appeal Number: EA/2009/0078 Signed Melanie Carter Deputy Chairwoman Date: 13 January 2010 10"
"83","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0026 Decided on the papers without a hearing Before KAREN BOOTH JUDGE MIKE JONES and DAVID WILKINSON TRIBUNAL MEMBERS Between FAISAL QURESHI Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE Second Respondent 1DECISION AND REASONS DECISION (NB In this Decision: the Respondent is referred to as “the Commissioner”; the Second Respondent is referred to as “the FCO”; the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is referred to as “FOIA”; and references to page numbers are to the numbered pages in the bundle of evidence that was produced for this appeal.) 1. The decision notice issued by the Respondent on 8 February 2018 (reference: FS50698949) is not in accordance with the law and the appeal is allowed. The following decision notice is substituted in its place. “The FCO incorrectly decided that section 14(1) applied to the request for information dated 4 November 2013. In dealing with this request, the FCO seriously contravened the time limits in sections 10 and 17 of FOIA. Within 35 days, the FCO must communicate to Mr Qureshi the information it holds that falls within the scope of the request for information or issue a fresh refusal notice complying with section 17.” REASONS Background to the appeal 2. Mr Qureshi is a film maker and journalist. He has a longstanding interest in the case of Helen Smith, a British nurse who died in unresolved circumstances in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1979. 3. Prior to making the request for information that is the subject of this appeal, he also made the following FOIA requests to the FCO for information about the Helen Smith case. • Request 1: On 20/1/08 he made a request relating to the case without a date range. He was asked to refine that request on cost grounds (section 12), which he did on 29/1/08 (Request 2), when he narrowed the period to 20/5/79-31/5/79. Request 2 was refused in reliance on section 40(2) and (3) and section 44(1)(a). (page 47) • Request 3: On 15/5/11 he made a request for information relating to the case and to Helen Smith’s father (who had died on 16/4/11). Request 3 was refused in reliance on sections 27(1)(a) and 40(2). (page 47) • Request 4: On 10/4/13 he made a request for information relating to the case and held in file reference 9/3766. The FCO disclosed the information requested with redactions made in reliance on sections 27(1)(a) and (c), 40 and 41. (page 47) 2• Request 5: On 27/8/13 he requested information relating to the period “after 1980” (page 119). He was asked to refine that request on cost grounds (page 122), which he did on 27/8/13 (page 121) (Request 6) when he narrowed the period to 1980-1982. On 24/9/13 (page 123) the FCO refused request 6 on cost grounds (section 12 of FOIA) but suggested that he refine it further. (pages 119 and 121) • Requests 7 and 8: On 24/9/13 Mr Qureshi submitted a fresh request (request 7) on the same terms but for information relating to the period 1980-1981 (page 125). On 25/9/13 he submitted a further request (request 8) for information relating to the period 1981-1982 (page 128). On 21/10/13, in two separate letters the FCO refused requests 7 and 8 on cost grounds (section 12) and again suggesting that he refine the requests further. (pages 125, 128, 131 and 133) The request for information that is the subject of this appeal 4. On 4/11/2013 Mr Qureshi submitted a further request to the FCO (Request 9) for information relating to the period 1/1/81 to 1/6/81 (page 135). His request was in the following terms ‘….. This is a revision of my original request with the reference number: 0889-13 I am looking for any documents relating to the activities and death of British citizen Helen Smith in Jeddah on May 1979. My previous request on the Helen Smith case (REF: 0314-13) was to ask for the release of the contents of FCO 8/3766 which was successful but the documents only covered the period of 1980. I am now looking for any documents that deal with the death of Helen Smith during the period of 1st Jan to 1st June 1981.’ 5. The FCO sent a holding response on 28/11/13 (page 138) estimating that they would provide a full response by 27/12/13 and a further holding response on 19/12/13 (page 140) with a new estimated date for a full response of 21/1/14. Further holding responses followed on a regular basis. 6. In the meantime, Mr Qureshi made a further request for information to the FCO on 11/1/16 (Request 10) in the same terms but in relation to the period 1/6/1981 to 31/12/1981. The FCO refused that request on 15/1/16 in reliance on section 14(1) of FOIA on the basis that “taking into account your request 1032-13 on this subject which is ongoing, we assess your request as currently drafted would fall into section 14 where ‘Requests which would impose a grossly oppressive burden but are not covered by the section 12 costs limits.’” (page 61). That refusal was the subject of a complaint to the Commissioner who (in a decision notice dated 2/6/16 – reference FS50618433 – page 60) upheld the FCO’s decision. Mr Qureshi did not appeal against that decision. 37. On 20/3/17 the FCO sent a full response (page 142) to request 9 confirming that the FCO held information relevant to the request but was withholding it in reliance on the following FOIA exemptions: section 27(1)(a), (c) and (d) (international relations); section 38(1)(a) (health and safety); section 40 (personal data) and section 41(1) (information provided in confidence). They had also considered the public interest test in relation to the qualified exemptions cited (sections 27 and 38) and decided that the public interest in maintaining those exemptions outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information. 8. On 20/3/17 Mr Qureshi requested an internal review of the FCO’s decision (page 145). The review response was sent on 5/7/17 (page 148). The FCO upheld their decision in relation to the exemptions already cited but “additionally concluded that section 14(1) (vexatious) also applies, given our extensive experience of working on this request” on the basis that responding to the request was likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of burden or disruption. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 9. On 4/9/17 Mr Qureshi complained to the Commissioner (page 151). 10. On 1/11/17 a Senior Case Officer wrote to the FCO drawing their attention to the Commissioner’s guidance on section 14(1) in the context of a request where it is claimed that compliance would impose a grossly excessive burden not covered by the section 12 (cost of compliance) exemption. The case officer advised that there is a high threshold for such a claim and that a viable case is only likely to be made out where all three of the following can be made out: • the requestor has asked for a substantial volume of information; • the authority has real concerns about potentially exempt information; and • any potentially exempt information cannot easily be isolated because it is scattered throughout the requested material. 11. The FCO response to the Commissioner’s enquiries is at page 170. Paragraphs 4 to 9 address the three criteria referred to above. The Information Commissioner’s decision 12. On 8/2/18 the Commissioner issued her decision (page 1). She decided that the FCO was entitled to rely on section 14(1) to refuse the request, on the basis that complying with the request would place a grossly oppressive burden on it. The appeal to this Tribunal Appeal grounds 13. Mr Qureshi appealed to this Tribunal on 14/2/18. His grounds of appeal are set out on page 13. He disagreed with the application of section 14(1) on the following grounds. 4• The FCO had plenty of opportunities in 2013 to reject the request on that basis but instead forced him to wait nearly 4 years. • In relation to a “far larger request” for documents from the Cabinet Office, the Tribunal had rejected section 14. • The FCO were considering 428 pages of information in this case, but he has previously received documents from the FCO that have been in excess of 1000 pages. Commissioner response to appeal - (page 16) 14. The response included a summary of the leading caselaw relating to section 14(1) in the context of a one-off burdensome request (as an alternative to relying on section 12) and the following points. i. The propriety of Mr Qureshi’s motive in making the request was not in doubt and neither was the potential value/public interest in at least some of the information. ii. On balance, the burden imposed by the request on the FCO is sufficiently excessive to trigger reliance on section 14. It is inherently plausible that there will be extensive references to personal data and to international relations and that the process of locating it and considering it for sensitivity would be extensive in a file of over 400 pages. iii. The ongoing notoriety/high profile nature of the case underlines the degree of sensitivities still likely to be in issue. iv. The Commissioner is mindful of not allowing FCO to take advantage of its unacceptable delays, but at least some of the time taken over the stakeholder consultation is supportive of the FCO’s time estimates and general burdensome nature of the request. v. The argument about the release of other larger files is unpersuasive. The FCO has consistently relied on section 14 in relation to requests for Helen Smith files. vi. The size of the file is only one indicator – a file of 1000 pages may require little review, whilst a file half the size may have sensitive information on every page. Mr Qureshi’s response – (page 23 15. After providing a timeline of his requests, Mr Qureshi made the following points. i. Given the FCO’s rejection of similar FOIA requests, they already had a good idea of what work would be involved. ii. The FCO asked for several revisions of the original request before they accepted it and has done in other cases. iii. The FCO only decided to apply section 14 at the internal review stage, which suggests that the decision was “…a last minute gambit …. for motives best known to themselves that have still not been adequately explained.” iv. The FCO has not satisfactorily explained why the FCO rejected request 10 on 26/2/16 but waited until 20/3/17 to reject the request which is the subject of this appeal. 5v. He has noted the content of paragraphs 28-31 of the Commissioner’s decision notice. Paragraph 31 suggests that if he had requested information relating to a 3-month period in 1981 the response would have been the same. “It appears that the Respondent had no inclination to release any documents but relied on an excessive delaying tactic which wasted [Mr Qureshi’s] patience and time.” Joinder of the FCO 16. On 23/3/18 the FCO was made a party to the appeal as the Second Respondent. FCO response - (page 46) with attachments 17. The FCO provided a chronology of relevant events, summarised the role/approach of the tribunal and made the following points. i. Should the Tribunal find that section 14(1) does not apply, the FCO will seek to rely on the exemptions cited in their refusal notice. ii. The FCO adopts the Commissioner’s analysis of the law applying to section 14(1), but adds references to the idea of proportionality being inherent in the policy behind section 14(1) (Wise V IC) and Judge Wikeley’s approval of a description “that “vexatiousness” connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure”. iii. The FCO made the following submissions on the grounds of appeal. iv. Mr Qureshi’s assertion that he limited the period of his request in accordance with the FCO’s suggestion is without factual or legal merit. But in any event that assertion does not establish any legal basis for the tribunal to interfere with the Commissioner’s decision. v. Mr Qureshi’s frustration at the delay in dealing with his request is appreciated and the Commissioner’s criticism noted. However, the referral to an excessive delaying tactic is rejected. The FCO issued regular written apologies for the delay and explanations for it throughout the relevant period. Their diligence and thoroughness were the subject of positive comment from the Commissioner. The delay is clearly regrettable but does not itself constitute a basis for allowing the appeal. No point arises from the timing of the section 14 exemption which arose as a direct consequence of the internal review process itself. The reference to a last-minute gambit ignores the comprehensive rationale set out in the FCO’s letter to the Commissioner of 12/1/18. Mr Qureshi’s case is not assisted by the earlier rejection of request 10; each case was concerned with different documentation and projected hours of work. vi. The Commissioner has accepted that the 428 pages of information assessed as falling within the scope of the request is a substantial amount of information. Mr Qureshi has not set out any proper basis for disagreeing with that finding. 6vii. The FCO was able to definitively quantify the time spent assessing the material for relevance at 4 hours and 52 minutes. viii. The “sensitivity review” time was estimated at 44 hours and 10 minutes. ix. The time spent on the case was a product of the volume of information and the complex and difficulty of the sensitivity review required. x. An additional 48.5 working days were required for attending to further tasks (including consultation with various stakeholders etc.). It was estimated that up to 40 people could be impacted by disclosure. xi. The request was therefore exceptionally time consuming. xii. The rationale was accepted by the Commissioner who found that the accuracy of the FCO’s time estimate for the sensitivity review was to be accorded “considerable credence” as it was based on a previous review of similar material. xiii. Mr Q had not sought to challenge the Commissioner’s decision regarding exempt information. xiv. The FCO explained the difficulty in isolating exempt information as accepted by the Commissioner and unchallenged by Mr Q. xv. The Commissioner’s decision notice did not address the exemptions relied on but alluded to them and indicated her acceptance that various exemptions are likely to be engaged. Mr Qureshi’s response to the FCO (page 69)-79) with attachments 18. Mr Qureshi’s main points were as follows. i. He accepts the FCO’s account of his FOIA history and their outline of his case. It is clear that the FCO has a consistent policy of denying releases of this request that go beyond the 30 year rule. ii. It appears that request 4 was successful because those documents had already been prepared for release into the National Archive. iii. The assertion that he does not establish any legal basis for challenging the Commissioner’s decision is at odds with his citation of Ashton in his appeal grounds. iv. The Respondents have not adopted the required holistic/broad approach applicable to vexatious requests. v. The correspondence shows that he took a reasonable approach when responding to the FCO and taking on board their suggestions. vi. The application of section 14(1) led to a lack of scrutiny by the Commissioner of the original exemptions cited. As regards their comments on his assertions about the tactical use of section 14(1) and their explanation to the Commissioner, he had only seen extracts from their letter to the Commissioner. vii. As regards his successful request on the Dennis Skinner case, there are many similarities between the 2 cases. Given the controversy surrounding the Skinner case one would expect that a lot of documents 7would have been withheld but around 23 folders of information were disclosed (about 2,549 pages) and there were no requests for a narrowing of the request. viii. As regards the 3 criteria that the commissioner considered: (i) he had reduced the time period of interest to a level that was deemed acceptable and there had been ample opportunity for the FCO to refuse the requests under section 12; (ii) if the FCO had real concerns about potentially exempt information, why did the Commissioner not ask for supporting evidence of this; (iii) he is unconvinced “..that the documents are scattered throughout the requested material ” (as explained in paragraphs 28-34). ix. There is no indication that the Commissioner has reviewed the 428 pages of extracted material. x. As it has been established that individual folders have been created in this case which in his experiences, are likely to be filed chronologically and to contain duplicates, he remains unconvinced by all of the FCO’s assertions. xi. He is concerned about the FCO’s reference to (further) narrowing the date range of his request “because isolating material in this way would give a selective and distorted view of the event and individuals associated with it ….”. He questions where in FOIA this is justified. xii. In paragraphs 45-63 of the response he set out some comments on the FOIA exemptions in sections 27, 38 and 41. FCO’s response (additional open bundle) 19. The FCO submitted a brief response, making the following points. i. For the avoidance of doubt, the FCO would resist any attempt to extend the scope of the appeal to include matters arising before the requests dated 4/11/13. ii. The FCO does not consider the FOIA response to the Skinner request to be relevant to this appeal. iii. The successful request (FOI 0314-13) was for a specific file and not for material scattered across different files/file record series. Mr Qureshi is incorrect to refer to the documents relating to this case having suddenly been spread out again. iv. The FCO is better placed than Mr Qureshi to evaluate the impact of disclosure on international relations and in any event this appeal is about section 14(1) and not section 27 (or the other exemptions originally cited). Appellant’s final submission with attachments (additional open bundle) 20. The Appellant made the following points in his final submission. i. In his response document dated 24/6/18, he had simply pointed out that the FCO’s own timeline had shown a consistent pattern of denying FOIA requests relating to the Helen Smith case, no matter what period of time was cited. This is continuing, as demonstrated by a further FOIA 8request he made to the FCO on 22/2/18 asking for documents relating to 1997, which has been refused in reliance on section 38. ii. He considers that his Skinner request is relevant as it (and other similar requests) show that the FCO file and collate such documents in chronological order. iii. And it has in any event been established that there are filing systems relating to the Helen Smith case. The cover sheet of the file released to him demonstrates this. iv. He goes on to make further observations about the section 27 issue. v. He refers to another section 14 case (Paul Arnold v IC - EA/2018/0061) “in which section 14 was thrown out”). vi. He refers to the list of indicators in the Commissioner’s section 14 guidance. He is not convinced that any apply given the scale of what was cleared and released in related FOIA requests. vii. He relies on previously published material (as listed in paragraphs 46- 51) to strengthen his case for release of the withheld information. The powers of the Tribunal 21. The task of the Tribunal is set out in section 58 of FOIA: 58 Determination of appeals (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. The issue we had to decide 22. The only issue we had to decide was whether request 9 was vexatious, within the meaning of section 14(1) of FOIA (“Section 1(1) [of FOIA] does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request if the request for information is vexatious.”). 23. For the reasons mentioned below, we could not consider any points relating to the exemptions referred to in the FCO’s refusal notice and review letter. We could not consider the amount of information provided in other cases as each case turns on its own facts and circumstances. 9The evidence and the type of hearing 24. The evidence before us consisted of: the paper evidence in the open bundle of documents (176 pages); and the paper evidence in the additional open bundle of documents (Government Legal Department (FCO) letter dated 7/8/18, Mr Qureshi’s final submission and attachments and case management directions dated 18/9/18). 25. All three parties requested a paper determination. After considering the bundle of evidence (which included the very thorough and detailed submissions from the parties referred to above) we were satisfied that we were able to determine the appeal without an oral hearing and that it was fair and just to do so. Relevant law 26. Section 12 of FOIA ((exemption where cost of compliance exceeds appropriate limit) is the most obvious basis upon which to refuse a request on cost grounds and should, as a matter of good practice, be relied on where it can be1. However, there are limitations on what may “count” for section 12 purposes. Section 12 can only apply to the costs a public authority reasonably expects to incur in: determining whether it holds the information; locating the information (or a document which may contain the information); retrieving the information (or a document which may contain the information; and extracting the information from a document containing it2. It cannot be relied on in respect of the costs of considering whether the information is exempt information or the costs of considering public interest issues. It is well established, however, that section 14 can extend to such a case. 27. Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley provides a very helpful and thorough summary (paragraphs 24-27 of his judgement) of the section 14 case law in Cabinet Office v IC and Ashton [2018] UKUT 208 (AAC), in the context of a case concerning a request that had been refused in reliance on section 14(1) on cost grounds. 28. He summarised the Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal decisions in the leading case of Dransfield v Information Commissioner [2015] EWCA Civ 454, referring to: • The Upper Tribunal’s guidance on the purposes of section 14 (to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA), as approved by the Court of Appeal (subject to the qualification that this was an aim which could only be realised if “the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied”). • The test under section 14 being whether the request is vexatious, not whether the requestor is vexatious. • The four broad (non-exhaustive) issues/themes identified by the Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley as of relevance when deciding whether a request is vexatious (the burden on the public authority and its staff; the motive of the 1 Craven v IC and DECC [2012] UKUT 442 (AAC) at [25]-[31]. 2 The Freedom of Information and Data protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004. 10requestor; the value or serious purpose of the request; and any harassment or distress of and to staff). • The Upper Tribunal’s guidance as to burden; the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the requestor and the public authority must be considered in assessing whether the request is properly to be described as vexatious. • The Upper Tribunal’s guidance that, in deciding whether a request is vexatious: “Ultimately the question was whether a request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Answering that question required a broad, holistic approach which emphasised the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there was a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests.” • The Court of Appeal’s rejection of the submission that past requests were relevant only if they tainted or infected the request that is said to be vexatious. • The additional guidance given by the Court of Appeal (Arden LJ) in paragraph 68 of the decision (the need to apply an objective standard, the high hurdle of satisfying section 14(1) and the need to consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion). 29. In paragraph 27, Judge Wikeley summed up as follows: “The law is absolutely clear. The application of section 14 of FOIA requires a holistic assessment of all the circumstances. Section 14 may be invoked on the grounds of resources alone to show that a request is vexatious. A substantial public interest underlying the request for information does not necessarily trump a resources argument.” In the same paragraph he went on to quote, with approval, an extract from the Commissioner’s written response to that appeal: “a. In deciding whether a request is vexatious within the meaning of section 14(1), the public authority must consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. b. The burden which compliance with the request will impose on the resources of a public authority is a relevant consideration in such an assessment. c. In some cases, the burden of complying with the request will be sufficient, in itself, to justify characterising that request as vexatious, and such a conclusion is not precluded if there is a clear public interest in the information requested. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious.” 30. The parties have cited other relevant decisions of the First-tier tribunal, but they are not binding precedents. 1131. The Commissioner’s views, as expressed in paragraph 13 of her decision notice, are based on the ICO guidance entitled Dealing with vexatious requests (section 14) (paragraphs 69-74). That guidance gives a helpful steer, but it is guidance and not the law. What we decided and why 32. We decided that the relevant circumstances of this case were as follows. 33. There has been no suggestion by the FCO or the Commissioner that motive was a factor in their decision or that there was a lack of value/serious purpose behind the request. Indeed, in paragraph 27 of her decision notice the Commissioner makes the following comment: “In reaching this conclusion, the Commissioner wishes to emphasise that she has, as she did with the complainant’s similar request, taken into account the purposes and value of the request. The Commissioner recognises that disclosure of the information could provide the public with an insight in to the Helen Smith case and potentially lead to greater transparency in relation to the FCO’s role in the case.” There has been no suggestion that Mr Qureshi has harassed or caused distress to FCO staff. From the evidence we have seen, Mr Qureshi’s communications with the FCO have been polite and temperate. 34. In this case, burden is the only factor cited by the FCO and the Commissioner which potentially points towards vexatiousness. Despite the number of requests made by Mr Qureshi in relation to the Helen Smith case, however, there has been no suggestion that the previous course of dealings between him and the FCO was a factor in the FCO’s decision to refuse the request on section 14 grounds. This did not surprise us. Despite having made 9 requests for information about the Helen Smith case, Mr Qureshi has been (partially) successful in relation to one request only (request 4). The request that was the subject of this appeal (request 9) was modified on three occasions before it was accepted by the FCO. There has been no suggestion that concerns about future burden were a factor in the FCO’s decision. 35. The FCO’s section 14 case therefore focussed only on the alleged cost burden of dealing with this request. 36. In this regard, we found as follows. By 20/3/17, when the FCO responded to the request (page 142), the FCO had: • located and identified the information falling within the scope of the request, which was included within three specific files totalling 428 pages of information; • undertaken “extensive stakeholder consultation” (second paragraph of the letter at page 142); • “carried out a detailed sensitivity review of the requested material” (fourth paragraph of the same letter); and 12• concluded that four FOIA exemptions applied and conducted a public interest test in relation to the two qualified exemptions. By 5/7/17, when the FCO sent their internal review response (page 148), they had undertaken “a further sensitivity review of the requested material” (page 49) and concluded that the information remained sensitive, the exemptions remained valid and the information should continue to be withheld. It was at that stage that they had “additionally concluded that section 14(1) (vexatious request) also applies, given our extensive experience of working on this request”. In the penultimate paragraph of that letter they said, in support of their reliance on section 14(1): We consider that the amount of time required to identify, review the information and undertake the necessary consultation with stakeholders has placed a significant and disproportionate burden on our resources.” 37. It is clear from this that, in relying on section 14(1) at this late stage, the FCO were taking account of tasks and costs that had already been undertaken/incurred (some of which could potentially have been grounds for refusing the request in reliance on section 12 at a much earlier stage). Having located the information, undertaken a very lengthy consultation exercise with stakeholders, conducted two sensitivity reviews and decided that all of the information within the scope of the request was exempt (and, in relation to the qualified exemptions, that the public interest test favoured retention), there did not appear to be any remaining burden to which section 14(1) could apply. 38. It follows from this that the three criteria considered by the Commissioner were not relevant to the issue of whether the request was vexatious on resources grounds, given that the resources referred to had already been utilised. The Commissioner’s office appears not to have focused on that crucial fact. Although it is unnecessary to say so, we felt that we should also mention that we were not in any event persuaded by the Commissioner’s acceptance of the FCO’s assertions in relation to the three criteria referred to in paragraph 13 of the decision notice. We accepted that 428 pages of information can be described as a substantial amount of information, but we were not persuaded that, relative to the amount of withheld information we have seen in other cases, that amount of information reaches the bar of being so substantial that it should count as such for section 14(1) purposes. We considered the estimated sensitivity review time of 44 hours and 10 minutes (which would equate to approximately 6 standard working days, based on a 7-hour day) for 428 pages of information to be improbably high. We were also puzzled by the reference in paragraph 21 of the Commissioner’s decision notice to relevant material being “scattered throughout the 103 files” when paragraph 16 clearly states that there were only 3 files in scope. 39. Having assessed all of the relevant circumstances we decided that the request was not vexatious. The FCO’s section 14 claim was solely and erroneously based on costs and resources that had already been utilised. There was a clear and substantial public interest underlying the request for information. There was no basis upon which we could find that section 14(1) applied. 13Case management directions dated 2/1/19 and 1/2/19 40. We met as a panel to determine this appeal on the papers on 4/12/18. We decided on that date that we were not satisfied that section 14(1) applied but that we needed to consider the exemptions that the FCO had also relied on before we could determine the appeal. We adjourned for that purpose. 41. Following the hearing I issued the attached case management directions dated 2/1/19. The Commissioner subsequently requested that we issue a decision (preliminary or final) about section 14 (and the FCO requested extensions of time to the dates set out in the directions). The Registrar then issued the attached directions dated 1/2/19. 42. As a panel, we subsequently decided that the appropriate way forward (in accordance with the “overriding objective” in rule 2 of the Tribunal’s procedural Rules3 (“to deal with cases fairly and justly”) was to issue a final decision about section 14. The Commissioner had properly made her decision on the basis of section 14(1) only, even though we disagreed with her conclusion. Section 14(1) is not a FOIA exemption. It is a provision that negates the section 1(1) obligations to confirm whether relevant information is held and, if it is, to communicate it to the requestor. Section 14(1) was not a preliminary issue in this case it was the main issue. If we insisted on requiring sight of the withheld information and submissions on the application of the exemptions before we finally determined the appeal, this would effectively deprive the Commissioner and the FCO of their right to challenge our decision on the section 14(1) issue. 43. This decision is, therefore, our final decision on section 14(1) and our final determination of this appeal. Conclusion 44. The Commissioner incorrectly decided that section 14(1) applied in this case and her decision notice is not, therefore, in accordance with the law. The appeal is allowed and we substitute the notice set out in paragraph 1 above for the Commissioner’s notice.

Authorities referred to Edem v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA (Civ.) 92 Durant v Financial Services Authority [2003] EWCA (Civ.) 2046 .Our Decision The Background 1. MS lives in Gilbert ‘s Coombe near Redruth, Cornwall. Early in 2014, Cornwall granted to the landowner/ occupant a certificate of lawful use for motorcycle trials, practice and training (“the certificate”) on land about fifty metres from her property. 2. The inevitable noise and the traffic aroused strong opposition from MS and other local residents. They challenged Cornwall’s finding that such activities had taken place on the relevant land for more than ten years, which was the legal precondition to the grant of the certificate. Questions were asked as to whether council officers involved in the assessment of the claim for the certificate had themselves participated in these trials or practice so as to create an obvious appearance of bias in their decision. 3. In addition to this challenge, over a significant period, MS sought the disclosure of what she deemed important documents held by Cornwall, revealing the nature of its dealings with the application for the certificate. The request 4. On 18th. March, 2014, MS wrote to Cornwall in these terms – “I am requesting an enquiry into the recent granting to land at Gilbert’s Coombe for a Certificate of lawful use of motor cycle trials, practice and training (So far this was a request relating to a planning issue, not a FOIA request for information.) I also request under the Freedom of Information Act any minutes of meeting, phone calls or indeed any other references taken during the time(x) was making his decision. I also ask for the names of any persons who were involved in the decision to award the certificate (delegated decision). I also ask for the names of the three planning officers that are members of the Motor Club in question as this would certainly be a conflict of interest.”. 5. Cornwall responded on 22nd. May, 2014. It indicated that some material within scope was accessible on its website and provided other information as a PDF attachment. It stated further that it held additional responsive information as to which it relied on exceptions provided for in EIR reg. 12(4)(d) and (e), 12(5)(b)(d) and (f) and reg. 13. This decision deals more fully with some of these exceptions and their relevance to this appeal below. 6. Cornwall also disclosed that the withheld information included a draft officer report (the final version of which was published on its website), a request for legal advice addressed by the planning department to a legal officer and the requested advice and a letter of objection. 7. Following an internal review requested by MS, Cornwall confirmed its refusal to disclose further information and its reliance on the exceptions already cited. It contended that the public interest, where a material factor, lay in withholding this information. MS complained to the ICO on 9th. October, 2014. The ICO’s investigation and the DN 8. On 4th.November, 2014 the ICO submitted to Cornwall the usual questionnaire, adapted to the facts of the particular case. In its response Cornwall produced a schedule which included on its first page a list of the exceptions relied on, linked to Appendix 1 to the response, which set out categories 1(a) – 1(e) of withheld information, attached to the response in unredacted form and described as follows –Category Content EIR Exception(s) relied on 1(a) Information disclosed to MS in redacted Reg. 13(1) form 1(b) Request for legal advice and advice Reg.12(5)(b), 12(4)(e) provided 1(c) “Legal correspondence” and draft report Reg.12(4)(d), 12(5)(b) 1(d) Note of legal team meeting Reg. 12(5)(b), 12(4)(e) 1(e) Objector’s letter Reg. 12(5)(f) All the documents referred to in this table were supplied unredacted to the Tribunal as to the ICO. 9. The DN upheld Cornwall’s reliance on reg. 13(1) as to “most of the personal data” contained in 1(a). It further accepted that the Reg.12(5)(b) exception ( disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice) was engaged in respect of all the information in 1(b), (c) and (d) as was reg.12(5)(f) as regards 1(e) (disclosure would adversely affect the interests of the person providing the information). In each case it concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighed the interest in disclosure. 10. MS appealed. The case for the Appellant 11. The submissions contained in MS’ Grounds of Appeal and two subsequent Responses to the Respondents’ arguments are directed in the main to the issues of law, fact and procedure relating to the issue of the certificate. She advances few, if any arguments on the engagement of the claimed exceptions, an understandable omission on the part of a factuallywell – informed member of the public unfamiliar with the interpretation of the EIR. 12. She argued very clearly, however, that, if any of those exceptions were engaged, the public interest in transparency as regards Cornwall’s handling of such a sensitive local issue was paramount. The case for the ICO and Cornwall 13. The ICO’s case as to reg. 13 is not entirely clear. He appears to argue that all the references to named individuals in the correspondence covered by 1(a) involve their personal data but that the disclosure of the names of senior council staff might not amount to unfair processing for the purposes of the first data protection principle. That would explain the reference to Reg. 13 being engaged as regards “the majority of the personal data”. He argued that the objector letter was the personal data of the author and that disclosure would be unfair to her. Reg. 12(5)(f) was engaged but he did not consider questions of the public interest because of his conclusion as to Reg. 13. 14. He submitted that Reg. 12(5)(b) was engaged in respect of all the material in 1(b)(c) and (d), which involved information subject to legal professional privilege and that the public interest required that the exceptions be maintained. Alternatively, the names appearing in 1(c) involved the personal data of those concerned and should be redacted for that reason. 15. As regards the public interest in disclosure, there was no weighty consideration which displaced the importance to be attached to the maintenance of confidentiality between client and lawyer, here Cornwall, in the form of its planning officer, and its internal solicitor. 16. Cornwall indicated in its Response that it considered that Reg. 12(5)(f) (adverse effect on the interests of the person providing the information) was engaged as regards the objector letter (1(e)) as well as reg. 13.Further, it stated that it had now disclosed the names of senior members of staff whose positions were identified in the DN, save in one case where the officer had not been involved in this case. So the Tribunal is concerned with the personal data of more junior council officers and of a number of members of the public and external solicitors. Our Reasons 17. The first question is the scope of the request, which was for “any minutes of meeting, phone calls or indeed any other references taken during the time (x) was making his decision”. “Any other references” is a vague term, which Cornwall seems to have treated very liberally as covering anything relevant to the decision on the certificate which was created during the period when that decision was being arrived at. We shall proceed on the footing that everything in 1(a) is within scope. The remaining classes (b) to (e) are undoubtedly within the ambit of the request. 18. We are required to deal only with the exceptions enacted in reg. 12(4)(e), 12(5)(b), 12(5)(f) and reg.13; reg. 12(4)(e) and 12(5)(f) are of marginal relevance. 19. We deal first with the application of reg. 13(1) to the documents in 1(a), all of which have been provided to MS but with names and sometimes roles, blanked out. 20. Uncertainties as to the effect of Durant v FSA [2003] EWCA (Civ.) 1746 on the interpretation of “personal data” have been dispelled by Edem v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA Civ 92, where the Court of Appeal explained the limited relevance of the two “notions” canvassed by Auld L.J. in Durant in the context of a specious subject access request. 21. It is now apparent that, in any request involving information as to third parties, ‘A name is personal data unless it is so common that withoutfurther information, such as its use in a work context, a person would remain unidentifiable despite its disclosure.” ( per Moses L.J. at para. 20). 22. There is therefore no doubt that the names in the redacted documents are “personal data”. 23. That being so, there is no evidence whatever to demonstrate that any condition in DPA Schedule 2 is satisfied in respect of any possible disclosure of the personal data of council officers. Indeed, nobody argued that any condition was met. The only potentially relevant condition, as usual, was condition 6(1) which requires proof that disclosure of the names “is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by (MS)”. Cornwall denies that any officer involved in the case had ridden on the land in question and there is no plausible evidence to refute that assertion. 24. Therefore, Cornwall was justified in withholding the names of members of its staff in documents in the range 207 – 233 of the Open Bundle, when revising its disclosures after the issue of the DN. It was, of course, entitled to provide names and particulars of senior staff, as it then did, with their consent. 25. The same applies for the same reasons, with few exceptions, to the names of members of the public appearing in the range 203 – 234, even though those familiar with this matter will have no difficulty in identifying most of them. Disclosure is disclosure to all the world. 26. One exception is the cremation certificate at 204. The name of the Registrar is critical to the validity of the document. 27. Another is the name of the author of the letter to Cornwall from Self – Drive Hire dated 31st. December, 2012. His identity is, in our opinion, critical to a proper assessment of the contents which support the grant of thecertificate. Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2 to the DPA is satisfied since MS was pursuing her legitimate interests as a landowner in seeking such information. Other names in the letter do not require disclosure. 28. The objector letter also raises different issues to which we turn below. 29. The engagement of the exception in Reg. 12(5)(b) requires proof that it is more probable than not that disclosure would adversely affect the course of justice. In this case that depends on whether legal professional privilege (“LPP”) attaches to the information concerned, although the fact that a document is privileged does not determine, of itself, whether the exception is engaged nor whether, if it is, the public interest favours withholding it. 30. There are two kinds of LPP (i) legal advice privilege, which attaches to material involving the seeking and giving of legal advice, including tactical advice, between lawyer and client and (ii) litigation privilege, which protects material, including lawyer – client communications, which is created in the course or in contemplation and for the predominant purpose of litigation. 31 It does not arise unless one party to the communication is a lawyer, regardless of the subject matter or the fact that legal advice is sought or given. By its nature, it does not attach to correspondence between solicitors on opposite sides of a dispute or a negotiation, though the latter activity may be conducted “without prejudice”, thereby potentially protecting it from disclosure in court. 32 The memorandum of 24th. May, 2013, (Appendix 1(b)) though apparently disclosed in redacted form (see 222), was sent by one of Cornwall’s solicitors to its planning officer in the context of a request for legal advice. It isprivileged. 33 The same goes for the minute of a meeting on 14th. August, 2013 between the same parties for the purpose of discussing legal issues involved in any grant of the certificate (Appendix 1(d)). 34 The draft report on the certificate question was clearly prepared for submission to a solicitor, as shown by the Email of 9th. May, 2013 to which it was attached. It, together with that Email and the responding Email from the solicitor, are equally plainly privileged. (Appendix 1(c) (part)) 35 As regards each of these documents disclosure in March, 2014, would have revealed Cornwall’s assessment of the strength of its position at a time when litigation or further complaints were a clear possibility. They are also covered by legal advice privilege. The general principle as to the weakening of trust in the confidentiality of privileged communications, for Cornwall and more generally, plainly applies. 36 We have no doubt that disclosure of any of this information would have adversely affected the course of justice. 37 These are weighty factors in the balance of public interests. As to interests favouring disclosure, there is always the virtue of promoting the principle of transparency in public affairs. and the presumption in reg. 12(2) must be born in mind.38 However, there is nothing apparently improper or dubious In Cornwall’s handling of this matter, such as to justify overriding LPP. The Tribunal always regards the preservation of client confidence in this privilege as a vital public interest which will prevail in the absence of powerful counter arguments specific to the case. There are none such here. 39 Different considerations apply to other “legal correspondence” in Appendix 1(c). Cornwall has now disclosed these documents with names etc. redacted but we rule on the matter since Regs. 12(4)(e) and 12(5)(b) were initially relied on. 40 Neither the letter of 5th. August, 2013 from Stephens Scown to Mr. Woodley of the Planning department nor their Emails are privileged and no exemption applies save reg. 13 as already noted. 41 The two Emails to and from MY Motors are not privileged and no other exception is engaged, save, as before, Reg. 13 as regards the name of the proprietor. With that exclusion, they are disclosable. 42 The remaining withheld Emails passing between council officers and to and from a councillor are not privileged. They are internal communications within Reg. 12(4)(e). However, no argument has been advanced as to a public interest in withholding them In the context of this exception. The Reg. 12(2) presumption suffices, of itself, to require disclosure, subject again to the redaction of names which have not been disclosed.43 That brings us to Appendix 1(e), the objector letter, which can be coupled with an Email of 5th. April, 2014 from MS to Mr. Woodley. In our view both require subject access requests pursuant to DPA s.7(1) and are exempt from disclosure under the EIR by virtue of Reg. 5(3). The objector letter would, no doubt, be disclosed with substantial redactions relating to the personal data of third parties. Summary 44 The following withheld information is therefore disclosable. (i) The name of the Registrar who signed the cremation certificate, (ii) The name of the author of the letter referred to at Paragraph 27. 45 We allow this appeal to that extent. 46 This decision is unanimous.

Dated this 24th. day of August, 2014 David Farrer Q.C. Judge [Signed on original] 3The Decision The Background 1. This appeal arises from the sequence of events which gave rise to the first appeal, EA/2014/0005, involving these parties and the SW Strategic Health Authority (“the SHA”). 2. Put shortly, MS, a non - executive director of Torbay Primary Healthcare Trust, in an email dated 11th. July, 2011, having made certain quite limited inquiries, raised questions as to the fitness of an elected candidate (“A”) to act as permanent chair of a “cluster” of such trusts in the South West follow- ing reorganisation of the National Health Service for the purposes of the Health and Social Care Bill. A had been selected by directors of the trusts as interim chair to handle the transitional arrangements. MS further criticised the procedure for A’s election to that interim post. 3. David Connolly (“DC”), the Torbay chairman advised A that MS’s findings would be passed to the Appointments Commission (“the AC”) if she main- tained her candidature. A withdrew as a candidate for the permanent ap- pointment. MS proceeded to air his criticisms quite widely, including in a letter dated 11th. September, 2011 to the Chairman of the SHA, which was copied to MPs from the region and to officers of the Plymouth Healthcare Trust. A telephone conference to review MS’s conduct and that of DC, took place with the chairman and deputy chairman of the SHA on 15th. Septem- ber, 2011. MS’s conduct prompted a letter from the chairman to a commis- sioner of the AC. That was the disputed information in the first appeal. An 4inquiry into the appointment was set up. The resulting report, dated 1st. No- vember, 2011, exonerated A, whose suitability MS had impugned. 4. An independent report into MS’ allegations and conduct was subsequently commissioned by the AC. On 12th. January, 2012, MS and DC met Mr. David Bradley (“DB”), the author of the report, to discuss these matters. DB, having interviewed other parties involved, including A, reported by letter to the AC on 26th. January, 2012. He advised on these issues; the decisions were for the AC. That report is the information of which MS now seeks dis- closure. The Request 5. On 19th. April, 2013 MS made the following request to the Department of Health (“the DoH”) :- . “I request a copy of a report submitted by David Bradley to the Appointments Commission on 26 January 2012. I understand a copy of this report is contained in files archived by the Appointments Commission. To assist you in locating the document, I attach a redacted version I received following a subject data access request. I am now requesting an unredacted version through the Freedom of Information Act.” 6. On 13th. May, 2013 the DoH replied, refusing the Request. In so far as the report contained the personal data of MS (already disclosed to him through the subject data access request), it relied on FOIA s.40(1) and no dispute 5arises as to that. As to the personal data of two third parties featuring in the report, it asserted the absolute exemption provided by s.40(2). It maintained that refusal following an internal review, citing the provisions of s.40(3)(a)(i) (contravention of a data protection principle), subject to disclo- sure of very limited further information from the report which did not in- volve such third party personal data. SH complained to the ICO. The Decision Notice 7. Following his investigation the ICO upheld the DoH’s refusal. In summary, he concluded that the redacted parts of the report contained the personal data of third parties (which is undisputed), that they had neither consented nor could have expected disclosure, that disclosure could cause them reputa- tional damage and distress and that no countervailing general public interest would prevent disclosure being unfair. MS appealed. MS’s case on appeal 8. This was set out first in his grounds of appeal and then in a commentary on the ICO’s Response dated 30th. April, 2014. MS focussed on the public interest in the procedures adopted by DB in investigating the allegations made by MS and the way in which MS had publicised them. Disclosure of the unredacted report would enable the public to judge whether such matters were properly and fairly investigated within the NHS. He disputed the confidential nature of DB’s discussions with himself or other parties. He made a distinction between employees and statutory office holders, such as 6himself and the third parties as to legitimate expectations. Both categories were entitled to procedural fairness. He did not explicitly challenge the ICO’s findings on absence of consent at the date of the request or possible reputational damage. 9. MS contended that DB had conducted his investigation in a flawed manner by refusing MS the chance to meet and, presumably, debate the issues with the chairman or vice chairman of the SHA who had also contributed to DB’s collation of evidence. He asserted that subsequent inquiries of the former chief executive of the AC indicated that DB had not been instructed by the AC that SH did not wish to meet the chairman or vice chairman, as DB al- legedly told them. He pointed to the failure to identify DB’s terms of refer- ence and argued that he was not clearly accountable to any particular body. He questioned the propriety of the SHA solicitor apparently advising DB. These features, so he said, cast doubt on the source of the authority on which DB was acting. He acknowledged a personal interest in these issues but con- tended that they were important in a wider examination of the governance of public bodies and the role of the whistle - blower. The Case for the ICO 10. The ICO adopted the arguments of the Decision Notice and acknowledged the possible relevance of a serious public interest to questions of fairness. He submitted, as is plain from Common Services Agency v Scottish Information Commissioner [2008] UKHL 47; at (7). that there is no presumption in fa- vour of disclosure in the case of personal data. He questioned the value of disclosure to the public interest asserted by MS. 7The Tribunal’s reasons for its decision. 11. So far as material s.40(2) and (3) provide - (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or… The first data protection principle is set out at Part I of Schedule 1 to the DPA 1998 and reads: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met…"" 12. The personal data of the two third parties in question were not “sensitive” such as to engage a requirement as to Schedule 3. However, they were undoubtedly of considerable significance to their professional 8reputations and disclosure would probably cause distress, at least in the case of A. These matters are further briefly considered in the Closed Annex. 13. The reasonable assumption of a senior officer, executive or non - executive, would be that discussions on such delicate issues would be confidential, unless the contrary was plainly stipulated. Seniority would not affect that expectation. The description of the report as “Strictly confidential” is not de- cisive of its status but reinforces a natural expectation in this case. DB’s in- vestigation was not a quasi - judicial proceeding; his role was to advise the SHA, which would act on that advice, if it thought fit. 14. Whether or not, one of the third party data subjects would now consent, neither gave consent to disclosure at or close to the time of the request. 15. In our judgement, a very compelling public interest would be required for disclosure of these data to be fair. 16. We can see no such interest here, most importantly because disclosure of the report would serve none of the purposes to which MS refers. Specifi- cally, the disclosure of the third party personal data, especially those of A, would serve no public purpose whatever. DB’s conclusions and advice would shed no light on the alleged shortcomings in the procedure that he adopted to prepare his report nor on any misconduct that MS apparently sus- pects. If flawed procedures in public affairs lead to bad advice and poor de- cisions (and we have seen no firm evidence that that is the case), the remedy lies in judicial review, not in exposure of possibly painful personal data to the world at large. 917. In any case, MS exaggerates the public interest in this information and the significance of what is involved. The bodies concerned no longer exist. The report into A’s history and conduct acquitted A of any impropriety and did so well before DB undertook his investigation. On the limited evidence be- fore the Tribunal, which is not, we emphasise, the forum to determine such questions, there was nothing obviously improper or unfair about DB’s han- dling of his task. He was not performing a judicial function, as MS seems to imply. What others said about what he had told them after the event is a fragile basis for claims that his report was the product of a seriously flawed, procedure, let alone malpractice. 18. We conclude that disclosure of these data would clearly be unfair. Given that finding, we do not proceed to consider Schedule 2 conditions. 19. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 20. Our decision is unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 24th. August, 2014 10"
"391","FOI","Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) Heard at Nottingham Decision Promulgated On 27, 28 and 29 June 2006 Reconvened hearing on 11 September 2006 28th September 2006 Before JOHN ANGEL Chairman And Jenni Thomson and Marion Saunders Lay Members Between DR PETER BOWBRICK Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCIL Additional Party Representation: For the Appellant: In person For the Respondent: Mr Timothy Pitt-Payne For the Additional Party: Mr Clive Jones Decision 1. A. The Tribunal finds that the Information Commissioner (IC) was wrong in law in upholding the Nottingham City Council’s (the Council) Refusal Notice because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct and that the Decision Notice cannot stand. 1Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 The Tribunal substitutes a new Decision Notice requiring the disclosure of the following documents to Dr Peter Bowbrick (Dr Bowbrick) within 14 days of the date of this decision, namely a. from the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence following the December Hearing minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” also dated 22 July 2003; b. from the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence on 3 August 2006: i. an undated document of objection from a parent as redacted in disclosure to the Tribunal at pages 188 to 192 of the bundle; ii. a letter of objection from a Councillor dated 3 July 2003 at page 193 of the bundle; iii. a letter of objection from Ellis Guildford School and Sports College dated 16 July 2003 at page 194 of the bundle. B. The Tribunal further finds that: c. the Council failed to confirm within 20 working days of Dr. Bowbrick’s request that it held information falling within the scope of his request. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(a) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s. 10; d. the Council failed to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick within 20 working days of his request the information that it held that fell within the scope of his request and that was not subject to any exemption under the Act. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(b) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s.10. e. the Council failed to identify within 20 working days of the request the exemptions upon which it relied in respect of certain documents falling within the scope of Dr. Bowbrick’s request. It thereby failed to comply within its duty under s.17(1) of FOIA within the time limit prescribed by that section. C. The Tribunal further orders that Nottingham City Council shall pay the whole of Dr Bowbrick’s costs as taxed as a litigant in person. 2Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 D. In addition, because of the unsatisfactory way that the disclosures have taken place, the Tribunal recommends that the Information Commissioner uses his powers under s.48 FOIA to make a practice recommendation to Nottingham City Council specifying steps which in the Commissioner’s opinion the Council should take in order for it to conform with the codes of practice under ss.45 and 46 of FOIA. In relation to this recommendation we are mindful of the fact that Dr Bowbrick has made further requests of the Council and the Tribunal is anxious that these requests do not result in further prolonged litigation. We would suggest, therefore, that this exercise is undertaken expeditiously. Reasons for Decision Background 2. The initial request for information was made by Dr Peter Bowbrick (Dr Bowbrick) to Nottingham City Council (the Council) in an email to Mr Alan Stead (Mr Stead) a Service Manager and head of the team responsible for freedom of information at the Council on 8th January 2005 (the Request). The email was headed access to information request, Freedom of Information Act 2000, and asked for the following information to be provided: Bluecoat School Wollaton Park Site All documents, electronic and other, including minutes of meetings concerning the handing over of the former Margaret Glenn Bott School to Bluecoat. This should include enquiries from members of the public and responses to them. This should include details of who was consulted. All contracts and other agreements between any public body (including Government, Nottingham City Council and the LEA) and Bluecoat, including, for instance, 1. Contacts of sale, 2. Leases, 3. Maintenance agreements and 3Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 4. Agreements on the education of children Informal agreements as well as formal are required. Any agreements between Bluecoat School and the Council regarding the use of the land and buildings on the former Margaret Glen Bott site. 3. Dr Bowbrick offered to provide additional clarification of the request if required. This offer was not taken up. 4. Mr Tony McGovern (Mr McGovern) the Chief Risk Officer at the Council wrote to Dr Bowbrick on 7th February 2005 and referred to the request for information relating to the Bluecoat School Wollaton Park Site. The letter stated that the previously supplied information should answer the queries. It also stated that if not satisfied with the response, Dr Bowbrick could make a complaint and an information leaflet explaining the complaints procedure was enclosed. The letter also explained that if following a response to the complaint Dr Bowbrick remained dissatisfied, he could approach the IC. 5. On 8th February 2005 Dr Bowbrick both emailed and wrote to Mr McGovern stating that he had not received any information relating to his specific questions. On the same day Dr Bowbrick also wrote to the Customer and Information Services Division under the complaints procedure stating that he had made a freedom of information request and that he had been refused any information. 6. On 15th February 2005 Mr Tony Austin a Solicitor to the Council wrote to Dr Bowbrick informing him that schools are regarded as being separate public bodies under FOIA and would probably hold the information he had requested. The letter continued “Therefore the information you require is not held by the Local Authority other than that which has already been provided to you.” He was also referred to a number of steering committee reports which could be obtained from the Education Department. Finally it stated that information relating to future proposals for the school were in draft form and therefore subject to an exemption at Section 22 of FOIA. This letter also referred again to the complaints procedure and reference to the IC. From here in onwards we will refer to this letter as the ‘Refusal Notice’. 4Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 7. The information which had been provided was in response to a request made before FOIA came into effect and was a copy of the Scheme for Financing Schools in the City of Nottingham Local Authority. In the Tribunal’s view this information had little or no relevance to the Request. 8. The IC issued a decision notice on 5th July 2005 in effect upholding the Refusal Notice. A revised decision notice was issued on 1st August 2005 correcting the name of the public authority involved (the Decision Notice). The process before the Tribunal 9. Dr Bowbrick appealed to the Tribunal on 10th July 2005 and the Council was ordered to be joined as a party on 12th August 2005 (the Joinder Notice) together with the following direction “that the Nottingham City Council provide to the Tribunal all documents and other information in their possession, including minutes of council meetings, in relation to the closure of Margaret Glen Bott School, Wollaton Park, in 2004 and/or its merger with Nottingham Bluecoat School, Aspley Lane in 2004 by 29 August 2005, indicating which documents and information are covered by the exemption claimed in the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice date 5 July 2005.” 10. The Council did not comply with the direction by 29 August 2005. However at the Directions Hearing on 3 October 2005 (October Hearing) the Council appeared to be very helpful and as a result the Tribunal ordered “The Council agrees that between 3 October 2005 and 24 October 2005 it will use its best endeavours: a. To identify, in discussion with the Appellant, any documents in the possession of the Council falling within the scope of this request made under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and b. To provide to the Appellant any information that ought to have been provided to him in response to that request.” 11. Also at the October Hearing the matter of exempt information was dealt with. The Council was ordered, in effect, to identify any information for which it was claiming an exemption and then to disclose this to the Tribunal in confidence. The issue of exemptions and confidentiality is dealt with by the Tribunal in its Practice Direction of March 2006 and Ruling in Sugar v The Information Commissioner and the British Broadcasting Corporation (12 May 2006, Case 5Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 Number EA/2005/0032). This has necessitated the Tribunal having private exchanges with the Council, even though the Tribunal still needed to determine whether exemptions claimed before the Tribunal which had not been disclosed previously, could in fact still be claimed. This important issue is dealt with later in this decision. The confidential exchanges have taken place with the knowledge of the other parties but without disclosing to them the contents of such exchanges, which would otherwise defeat the object of providing for exemptions under FOIA. Again this issue is more specifically dealt with later in this decision. 12. As a result the October Hearing was stayed pending this exercise taking place in hopeful anticipation that this would lead to Dr Bowbrick being provided with the information he had requested. 13. At the October Hearing it was envisaged in exchanges between Dr Bowbrick and Mr Stead that Dr Bowbrick would visit the Council’s offices if necessary for several days to help identify the documents. This was recognised by Mr Stead’s email to Dr Bowbrick of 7th October 2005 (email of 7th October 2005). Although there were some email exchanges following the October Hearing, no meeting or face to face discussion took place and it would appear that the Council took the unilateral decision that it was unnecessary as is again evidenced by the email of 7th October 2005. The Tribunal notes that, in evidence before the Tribunal at the full hearing in June 2006, Mr Stead denied that it had been envisaged that Dr Bowbrick would visit the Council’s offices to help identify the information requested. This was not the recollection of the Chairman of this Tribunal, or as evidenced by the order, email exchanges and Dr Bowbrick in his evidence. 14. Around 20th October 2005 the Council sent information to Dr Bowbrick in relation to the order. On 23rd October 2005 Dr Bowbrick provided a detailed analysis of this information running to some 18 pages indicating what he regarded to be still missing and that he still wished to pursue the appeal as the information he had requested had not been provided. 15. The Council did not respond to this analysis and the Tribunal decided to reconvene the Directions Hearing on 9th December 2005 (December Hearing). A few days before the December Hearing the Council let it be known that it would be making further disclosures of approximately 1000 pages of information, but without giving a reasonable opportunity before 6Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the December Hearing for Dr Bowbrick to consider these disclosures. At the December Hearing Dr Bowbrick was ordered “By 31 January 2006…to lodge with the Tribunal, and serve on the other parties, his written response to the Council’s most recent disclosure of information, explaining: a. whether he considers that the Council has now made a full and proper response to his request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and b. if not, in what respects he maintains that the Council’s response is still defective.” 16. Dr Bowbrick carried out this exercise and by letter dated 15th January 2006 to the Tribunal indicated there were still substantial gaps in the information supplied, and that there had not be an adequate response to his original analysis of 23rd October 2005. 17. At the December Hearing both the IC and Council admitted that the Decision Notice could not stand in view of the disclosures which had already taken place, which amounted to approximately 1000 pages of information and there was further information for which the Council claimed exemptions under FOIA. These exemptions were being claimed for the first time before the Tribunal. They had not been raised in the Refusal Notice or during the IC’s investigation of Dr Bowbrick’s complaint. 18. Other directions were made in order for the case to be prepared for the full hearing which eventually took place between 27th and 29th June 2006 (the Full Hearing). The Council made a further disclosure in March 2006.. 19. Early on in the Full Hearing the parties were invited by the Tribunal to take the opportunity to agree among themselves what further information might be provided in response to the Request. They agreed to take up the opportunity and as a result the hearing was adjourned while these deliberations took place over approximately two days. What resulted was the production of a 36 numbered points document which the Council agreed to respond to under the terms of further directions dated 30th June 2006 (June Directions) and which also gave directions as to how the parties should respond to the Council’s response. 7Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 20. The Council responded to the 36 points providing further limited disclosures to Dr Bowbrick and claiming further exemptions in relation to new information discovered. Dr Bowbrick considered this response and again found it did not finally satisfy his Request. 21. As a result the Tribunal reconvened the Full Hearing on 11th September to make its determination based on the papers before it, the parties having agreed that there was no further need for an oral hearing at this stage of the proceedings. Jurisdictional point 22. At the commencement of the Full Hearing Mr Jones on behalf on the Council invited the Tribunal to substitute a decision notice that requires the Council to make a proper response to Dr Bowbrick’s request. He argued that Part V of FOIA restricts the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to an appeal against the decision notice served by the IC pursuant to s.50 FOIA, and that there is no jurisdiction to deal with any other matter and certainly not acts, omissions or decisions of a public authority which are not the subject of the decision notice. 23. He further argued that the appeal process provides a filter to enable issues to be narrowed and reduce the need for and length and expense of appeals further up the ladder. In this case he proposed that we should allow the appeal which would have the effect of setting aside the decision notice and leaving it to the IC to make a fresh decision. 24. The difficulty with the course proposed by Mr Jones is that any substitute request would in effect cover the disclosure that has been made so far to Dr Bowbrick and therefore the question as to whether there is any further information that should be disclosed would be left unresolved. Mr Jones says that this issue could be dealt with by going through, first of all, an internal review and then a complaint to the Commissioner, and then a further appeal to this Tribunal. So in effect the whole procedure would go back to square one. Mr Jones contended that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to take any other course. 25. The Tribunal does not accept his argument about jurisdiction. Under s.58(1) FOIA the Tribunal can “allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner."" The question in this appeal is what, if any, substitute notice the Tribunal could serve, and in order to answer that question, the Tribunal needs to address the question as to whether the Council holds any further information other than the information that it has 8Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 disclosed or the information that it has identified in relation to which it has claimed an exemption. Therefore the Tribunal needs to engage with two questions. Firstly, is Dr Bowbrick correct when he says that there is yet further information that he has identified that has not been supplied? Secondly, is he also correct when he says that to the extent that the Council has relied on exemptions, it cannot do so because it has raised these exemptions too late. The Tribunal needs to resolve those two questions in order to decide what substitute notice it should serve, should the Tribunal decide to do so. 26. Moreover s.50(4), provides for what the Commissioner should do in a case where he considers that the public authority has failed to communicate information. In such a case the decision notice must specify the steps which must be taken for complying with the requirement. In other words, the decision notice does not simply require the public authority to go back and have another go at complying with the Act. The Commissioner's decision notice would require the disclosure of specified information within a time period. Similarly where the Tribunal serves a substitute decision notice, the substitute decision notice needs to set out the information to be disclosed within a time period. Alternatively, the substitute decision notice might acknowledge that all the relevant information has been communicated, but has been done so late, or that the public authority had failed to comply with other procedural requirements of FOIA. 27. Mr Jones also seems to be submitting that the Tribunal may only review the facts on which the notice in question was based. He says what has happened since this appeal was brought cannot possibly be part of the facts on which the decision was based. However both the IC and the Council have accepted that the findings of fact of the Commissioner, that the Council did not hold any relevant information, cannot stand. The Tribunal may review that finding of fact under s.58(2) FOIA in the light of evidence that has emerged since the Commissioner's decision. We are not confined to looking at the evidence that was before the Commissioner. Part of the process of reviewing a finding of fact is deciding what finding of fact should be put in its place. Then the choice for the Tribunal is to substitute a finding of fact that the information held by the Council is the information that has since been disclosed or, alternatively, to substitute a finding of fact that the information held by the Council is the information that has since been disclosed and certain further information in addition. Depending on which of those two findings of fact that the Tribunal substitutes, this will then feed into the decision that the Tribunal makes about what substitute notice, if any, the Tribunal should make. 9Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 28. Returning to the scope of the Full Hearing there are three possible options. The first is that the Tribunal could find that there has now been compliance with the Act but it is very late and we will allow the appeal because the Commissioner's decision notice cannot stand because it is based on an error of fact, but we do not need to go any further because, albeit the request has been complied with late, the Council has done what it was required to do. The second option is to find that the Council may have done what it was required to do but we, the Tribunal, think that we should substitute a decision notice that makes clear in what respects the Council failed to comply with the Act. The third option is for the Tribunal to find that the Council has taken certain steps but it still has not fully complied, and in order fully to comply it has to take the following steps. 29. In order to choose between those three options, the Tribunal needs to ascertain, firstly, does the Council hold any further relevant information. Secondly, can the Council in principle rely on exemptions which it has only raised in the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal. Thirdly, if it can, are the particular exemptions that it has invoked, rightly invoked in the particular circumstances of this case. Whether the Decision Notice can stand 30. The IC and the Council have agreed the Decision Notice cannot stand. The Council admits that it did hold information the subject of the Request. The Refusal Notice was issued in breach of s.1 FOIA. The IC admits it was wrong in law in having upheld the Refusal Notice and dismissing Dr Bowbrick’s complaint under s.50 FOIA because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct. Under s.58(1)(a) we find the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. 31. The next matter for the Tribunal to decide is whether to allow the appeal or issue a revised decision notice under s.58(1) FOIA, and if so on what terms. The decision on which option to take depends on whether or not the Tribunal should order the Council to disclose further documents to Dr. Bowbrick. Therefore the Tribunal needs to consider whether the Council hold further documents falling within the Request that it ought now to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick. 32. We accept that despite a long drawn out process the Council has now made extensive attempts to locate the relevant information. These have been set out at length in response to direction orders, the witness statements prepared by the Council and evidence given by those witnesses at 10Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the Full Hearing, and in the detailed material prepared by the Council following that hearing. In the light of all of this material, which is now very extensive, the Tribunal concludes that the Council has now conducted the sort of investigations that it should have conducted at the outset, which would, in the Tribunal’s view, have avoided the lengthy litigation in this case. 33. We appreciate that Dr Bowbrick is still not satisfied with the Council’s investigations but we do not believe that if the Tribunal ordered, in effect, further investigations, bearing in mind the Tribunal has seen in confidence many other documents to which the Council has claimed an exemption that such investigations would result in further disclosures. The matter of exemptions is dealt with in detail below and the Tribunal does find that some of the documents claimed to be subject to exemptions should be disclosed. Can exemptions be claimed for the first time before the IC 34. The Council has supplied certain documents to the Tribunal in relation to which it claims exemption under FOIA. 35. The Council is relying on exemptions in this appeal, which are exemptions that it did not invoke either in its initial reply to Dr Bowbrick or in the course of the IC's investigation. Therefore the Tribunal needs to decide whether the Council is debarred from relying on those exemptions because they are only raised at this late stage, that is to say, following the appeal to the Tribunal. If the Council is debarred from relying on those exemptions, then there is no need to consider whether they have been properly invoked in relation to the disputed information. This is an important general question for the Tribunal in terms of the scope of the Tribunal's enquiry. 36. If the Council can rely in principle on exemptions claimed at this late stage, then the next matter for us to decide is whether the particular information in question falls within the particular exemptions relied on. The principal exemption now being claimed is that of legal professional privilege (LPP) under s.42 FOIA. The Council has provided certain information to the Tribunal only. As stated earlier in this decision there has been a process of confidential written exchanges between the Tribunal and the Council in order to properly determine whether the material put before us in confidence is caught by the exemption being claimed, and if so whether the public interest balance has been correctly carried out. Inevitably these exchanges have to be confidential because, if they are made public at this stage and disclose the content of the disputed information, that would pre-empt the very question that is at issue, which is whether 11Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 that disputed information should be disclosed to Dr Bowbrick or not. If an appellant finds out the content of the information from what is said at the Tribunal appeal, then the Tribunal appeal would be rendered futile. This is a problem that recurs time and again before this Tribunal given the nature of our jurisdiction and the questions that we are trying to resolve and why the Tribunal have issued a Practice Direction on confidential information and issued a ruling on the subject in Sugar (cited above). 37. In order to deal with that question of principle about exemptions a good starting point is to turn back to the language of FOIA. Under s.1(1) the general right of access to information held by public authorities falls into two parts. The right to be informed, whether the authority holds information of the description specified in the request; and then the right to have the information communicated. From the point of view of the public authority, there is a duty to confirm or deny which corresponds to s.1(1)(a) and a duty to communicate which corresponds to s.1(1)(b). 38. The duty to confirm or deny is something that does not play a major part either in most of the IC's decisions or in most of the appeals so far to the Tribunal, because the duty in itself is a very limited duty. It is not a duty to provide a list of documents that the public authority holds falling within the scope of the request. It is a duty to say whether the public authority holds any relevant information or not. So in most cases that duty is relatively easy to comply with. The real issue is in relation to what is the duty to communicate. In other words the duty that corresponds to s.1(1)(b); the right for the requester to have information communicated to him or her. That duty exists, except in circumstances where there is a relevant exemption. S.2 provides that that duty does not arise either in respect of information that falls within an absolute exemption or within a qualified exemption provided in the latter case that the balance of the public interest is in favour of maintaining the exemption rather than disclosure. 39. S.2 FOIA is framed in terms that the duty to communicate does not arise if certain provisions apply. It is not framed in terms that if a public authority contends that an exemption is applicable and that contention is upheld by the IC or the Tribunal, then the duty to communicate does not arise. S.2 says that if an exemption applies, the relevant duty does not arise. 40. However, there are also procedural duties on the public authority in respect of exemptions under ss. 10 and 17 of FOIA. S.10 sets the time limit for compliance with requests, in general not later than the 20th working day following receipt. S.17 requires that where a public authority is 12Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 relying on an exemption, then within the same timescale for complying with the s.10 duty, it has to notify the requester in essence that it is relying on an exemption and why the exemption applies, if that is not otherwise apparent. Where a qualified exemption is relied upon, the public authority also has to set out its reasons for claiming that the balance of the public interest is in favour of maintaining the exemption. 41. S.17(1) requires the public authority to provide the applicant with a notice containing certain information within the time limit in s.10(1). S.10(3) allows an extension of time where qualified exemptions are being claimed in order to apply the public interest test, but at the end states that ""this subsection does not affect the time by which any notice under section 17(1) is to be given."" This would appear to mean that public authorities have to give the s.17(1) notice within the time limit specified in s.10(1), namely by the 20th working day following receipt, but under s.10(3) a potential extension of time for disclosure is given in cases where there is a qualified exemption at stake, and in those cases the public authority has “until such time as is reasonable in the circumstances.” This means that authorities have at the most 20 working days to specify the exemptions that they rely on, but if they are relying on a qualified exemption, then they may be entitled to further reasonable time in order to decide where the balance of public interest lies and a further reasonable time to communicate the information in question, if the authority’s decision is that the information ought to be communicated. 42. If a public authority does not raise an exemption until after the s.17(1) time period, it is in breach of the provisions of the Act in respect to giving a proper notice because, in effect, it is giving part of its notice late. However FOIA does not say that that failure to specify the exemption within the 20 working day time limit means that the authority is disentitled thereafter from relying on the exemption in any way. If the intention of FOIA had been that the exemption could no longer apply to the information in such circumstances then it would have been expected that the Act would say this in very clear terms, because otherwise it is a very draconian consequence of the failure to comply with the statutory time limit. 43. Where there is a complaint to the IC under s.50 the Commissioner has various obligations. Specifically under s.50(4), where the IC decides that there has been a failure to communicate or a failure to confirm or deny, then the effect of s.50(4)(a) is that the decision notice issued by the Commissioner has to specify what the authority must do and the period within which those steps 13Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 must be taken. Similarly, if there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of ss. 11 or 17, the decision notice must specify what should be done and when it should be done. 44. The interesting point about s.50(4) is that it is treating a failure to communicate or confirm or deny and a failure to comply with the time limits in s.17 as being two separate issues. There is the issue in relation to compliance with the s.17 time limit. Then there is the issue of compliance with the duty to confirm or deny under s.50(4)(a). If there has not been compliance then the IC must specify steps to be taken to comply. What the Commissioner is looking at is whether the request has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 FOIA - s.50(1). If there has been a failure by the public authority to identify a particular exemption that it relies on and that exemption has not been identified until the Commissioner's investigation is underway, then there has been a failure to comply with s.17 and the Commissioner should record that, and if that failure is ongoing, the Commissioner should require steps to be taken to rectify it. 45. There is a separate question as to whether there has been a failure to comply, not just with s.17 but with the s.1 duty to communicate. In order to determine whether there is a failure to comply with that duty to communicate, the IC has to decide whether this is information in relation to which the duty to communicate arises. In order to decide that, the IC has to take into account any exemption claimed, notwithstanding that the exemption is raised later than it should have been done in the process. The Commissioner needs to look at the information, to look at the exemption that has been claimed, to ascertain whether the exemption is properly applicable or not. If it is, then the duty does not arise in respect of that information, and so the failure to communicate the information was not in itself a breach of the requirements of the Act. A differently constituted division of this Tribunal in Mitchell v The Information Commissioner (10 October 2005, Case Number EA/2005/0002 at paragraph 16), supported this reasoning, although not having to decide the point. 46. However the IC does not have a positive duty to look for exemptions that might have been claimed by the public authority, but have not been claimed by the authority. If a public authority fails to invoke a particular exemption before the IC, and the Commissioner orders disclosure of the information, the public authority cannot then come to this Tribunal and say it was an error of law for the Commissioner to fail to put forward on our behalf a particular exemption which we did not put forward on our own behalf. If the public authority raises an 14Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 exemption, the Commissioner needs to consider whether that exemption is applicable, but if the public authority does not raise an exemption, the Commissioner does not have a positive duty to look for exemptions on which the public authority might rely. 47. If the Tribunal were to find differently, then the whole basis of FOIA would be undermined. FOIA is not drafted to find ways to withhold information. 48. Moreover public authorities have discretion as to whether they wish to claim an exemption. Even if information could be exempt the authority does not have to invoke an exemption. In general, it is the public authority that is in a position to identify reasons why particular information may give rise to particular exemptions. It is the public authority that in the first instance is expected to carry out the balancing exercise between the public interest and disclosure and the public interest in maintaining an exemption. It is not the scheme of the Act that the Commissioner should have a general duty to consider the application of any possible exemption, even if not raised by the public authority. 49. The Commissioner, however, would be entitled to look for an appropriate exemption in some exceptional cases. This could happen where a public authority claims a particular exemption and the Commissioner considers that the authority has mis-identified the correct exemption. For example, there is a close relationship between the exemptions in s.30 (investigations) and s.31 (law enforcement). The information can only be within s.31 if it is outside s.30 and sometimes there is an issue as to where the particular information falls. 50. Another example would be where the exemption may have been claimed under the wrong jurisdiction and it would make sense to consider any similar exemption under the correct jurisdiction. This is what happened in Kirkaldie v The Information Commissioner (4 July 2006, Case Number EA/2006/0001) where a differently constituted division of this Tribunal found that the Commissioner had wrongly considered the complaint under FOIA when the request was for environmental information under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The public authority claimed the LLP exemption under s.42 FOIA, which the Tribunal held could, in effect, be considered under a similar exemption under Regulation 12(5) of the 2004 Regulations. 15Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 51. A further example of such an exceptional case could be where the personal data exemption is claimed under s.40. The IC is in the position of being the guardian of both the rights of data subjects under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and of the rights of people seeking information under FOIA. If the Commissioner considered that there was a s.40 issue in relation to the data protection rights of a party, but the public authority, for whatever reason, did not claim the exemption, it would be entirely appropriate for the Commissioner to consider this data protection issue because if this information is revealed, it may be a breach of the data protection rights of data subjects. Otherwise it would put the Commissioner in a very strange position where the Commissioner is responsible for both freedom of information compliance and data protection compliance. S.40 is designed to ensure that freedom of information operates without prejudice to the data protection rights of data subjects. Therefore it would be a very curious situation if the Commissioner had to forget about his data protection enforcement role when he had his freedom of information hat on. 52. The Tribunal would reiterate that there is no suggestion that there is a general duty on the Commissioner to seek potentially relevant exemptions if those had not been invoked by the public authority before the Commissioner. If there was a general duty on the Commissioner to seek relevant exemptions, then a public authority could sit back and do absolutely nothing during the Commissioner's investigation, making no submissions to the Commissioner as to why information was exempt, but then come to this Tribunal and argue that the Commissioner's decision is wrong in law because the Commissioner failed in his legal duty to seek relevant exemptions that might apply. Can exemptions be claimed for the first time before the Tribunal 53. We next need to consider the situation of the Tribunal in an appeal under s.57 FOIA. The Tribunal must consider whether a decision notice is not in accordance with law or involves a wrong exercise of discretion. If the answer to both question is no then the appeal must be dismissed: s.57(1). If the public authority appeals against an IC’s decision requiring disclosure, and the only basis for the appeal is that the Commissioner ought to have found that the information fell within a particular exemption, then if the exemption was not raised by the public authority in the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, then the appeal is bound to fail. There can be no basis for suggesting that the IC erred in law or wrongly exercised his discretion, merely by failing to raise the point on the public authority’s behalf. 16Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 54. However, the present case is different. In this case it is the complainant who appeals. It is accepted by the Council and the Commissioner that the Decision Notice cannot stand. The Tribunal thus has the choice between merely allowing the appeal, or substituting a revised Decision Notice. If the Tribunal does the latter then it needs to decide what should be the terms of the revised notice. In deciding whether there should be a revised notice, and if so on what terms, it is relevant for the Tribunal to take account of a claim by the public authority that an exemption applies in respect of particular information. The Tribunal is in effect exercising the powers of the Commissioner at this point. We ought not to ignore the public authority’s claim that an exemption applies, just as the Commissioner ought not to ignore a similar claim if it is raised during his investigation. If the claim is well-founded then the Tribunal ought not to order disclosure, just as in comparable circumstances the Commissioner ought not to order disclosure. 55. The consequences of any other approach to the Tribunal’s powers might well be seriously unjust. Mr Pitt-Payne provides the following hypothetical case. One of the items of information that falls within the scope of a particular request is a piece of legal advice. Unfortunately the public authority overlooks the existence of the advice until after an appeal has been lodged with the Information Tribunal arising out of the way in which the request was dealt with. The public authority discloses the existence of the advice but contends that it is exempt under s.42 FOIA. Must s.42 be disregarded merely because the existence of this particular item of information was previously overlooked? The Tribunal considers it is in a similar position to the Commissioner as set out above, namely that we are obliged to consider any exemption claimed, even if it is claimed for the first time before the Tribunal as in this case. 56. However the Tribunal finds, in the same way as for the IC, that it does not have a general duty to consider whether there are any relevant exemptions and to apply them if it considers that there might be, even if no party has raised any relevant exemptions. In a situation like the present case, where the public authority says there is a relevant exemption, the Tribunal needs to decide whether there is such an exemption, because that is a step on the way to deciding whether this Tribunal is going to order disclosure by way of variation of the decision notice, and if the Tribunal is going to make a substituted order then what will be the terms of that order. 57. The Tribunal then needs to decide, whether the particular exemptions relied upon in relation to the disputed information, are properly applicable. 17Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 Findings in relation to exempt information 58. The Tribunal has thoroughly reviewed the confidential information which has been disclosed to the Tribunal in this case principally in two tranches, one before the Full Hearing and one during the Full Hearing. The confidential disclosure not only identifies the document and the exemption claimed but also explains how the Council has applied the public interest test (PIT) in favour of non disclosure. The Tribunal comments that the two bundles of confidential information duplicate some documents which has made it confusing at times for the Tribunal to consider. 59. The Tribunal finds that all the confidential information with five exceptions is subject to the LPP exemption under s.42 FOIA. The exceptions include minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” which have been claimed to subject to LLP. This is clearly wrong and these documents should be disclosed. We understand from the evidence that these documents may have already been provided to Dr Bowbrick. The other exceptions relate to documents where another exemption has been claimed but without showing how the PIT has been applied by the Council. 60. In relation to the other confidential documents to which the LLP exemption has been claimed we are satisfied that the Council has applied the PIT correctly and that the Council is entitled to withhold the documents. 61. The Tribunal observes that whether an exemption applies depends on the nature of the information at issue and not on the behaviour of a public authority holding that information. The fact that an authority has failed to discharge its substantive obligations under the FOIA, in terms of identifying and providing information, does not alter the nature of the information it holds and the application of the exemptions must still be considered on the facts of each request. 62. The Tribunal observes that it has recently examined the s.42 exemption. In Bellamy v Information Commissioner and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (May 2006, Case Number EA/2005/0023) the Tribunal characterised LPP as ""a fundamental right at least insofar as the administration of justice is concerned"". Privilege can of course be waived, and the Tribunal can make a finding that it has in fact been waived, subject of course to the proviso that 18Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 the embargoed material is legitimately the subject of a claim to LPP - see Kirkaldie (cited above) Non compliance with time limits 63. A differently constituted division of this Tribunal has already considered whether the time limits in the Act have teeth – see Harper v The Information Commissioner (15 November 2005, Case Number EA/2005/0001). A number of the early decision notices of the IC were decisions where a public authority had failed to comply with the s.10 time limit and recorded those failures but did not require any further action. If that is how such failures are handled by the IC why should a public authority that wants to delay matters not simply hold on to information until a complaint is made to the Commissioner? As soon as a complaint is made to the IC, the authority then discloses the information, it receives a decision notice, which is in effect a slap over the knuckles and nothing more and with no practical consequences. 64. In Harper we set out what the Commissioner can do with the public authority that is deliberately delaying compliance with the time limits in ss.10 and 17 in order to delay the moment when it has to give disclosure under the Act. Briefly, s.49 reports can be laid before Parliament in effect entitling the Commissioner to name and shame public authorities that behave in this way. Where there is a cynical or persistent or deliberate breach of time limits, the IC could serve an enforcement notice under s.52 requiring proper compliance with the time limits in the future, which could then lead to the failure being certified to the court under s.54 and dealt with as for a contempt of court. Finally under s.48, a recommendation as to good practice can be made which we will refer to again later in this decision. Tribunal’s finding in relation to the Decision Notice 65. Under s.58(1) FOIA where the Tribunal finds that decision notice is not in accordance with the law, the Tribunal has power to “allow an appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner.” As indicated above the Tribunal finds that the Decision Notice is wrong in law, which is accepted by both the Council and the IC because the Decision Notice was based on a finding of fact which the IC now accepts is not correct. 66. The Tribunal has already concluded above that the Council has now conducted the sort of investigations that it should have conducted at the outset and that as a result significant disclosures have taken place. The Tribunal considers that any further investigation is unlikely to 19Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 result in new disclosures and therefore has reluctantly decided to limit the extent of the revised decision notice as follows. Substituted Decision Notice 67. The Tribunal orders that the Council provide the following documents, for which exemption has been claimed, to Dr Bowbrick within 14 days of the date of this decision: a. From the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence following the December Hearing minutes of an Executive Board meeting of 22nd July 2003 and a report from the Director of Education headed “School Reorganisation Proposal Closure of Margaret Glenn-Bott School, Re-allocation of the Catchment Area an the Expansion of Bluecoat School” also dated 22 July 2003; b. From the bundle of documents sent to the Tribunal in confidence on 3 August 2006: i. An undated document of objection from a parent as redacted in disclosure to the Tribunal at pages 188 to 192 of the bundle; ii. A letter of objection from a Councillor dated 3 July 2003 at page 193 of the bundle; iii. A letter of objection from Ellis Guildford School and Sports College dated 16 July 2003 at page 194 of the bundle. 68. The Tribunal should make the point that we have not considered any information disclosed to us only in confidence by the Council which is dated after the date of the Request because it is not part of this appeal. 69. The Tribunal also makes the following findings: a. That the Council failed to confirm within 20 working days of Dr. Bowbrick’s request that it held information falling within the scope of his request. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(a) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s. 10; b. That the Council failed to disclose to Dr. Bowbrick within 20 working days of his request the information that it held that fell within the scope of his request and that was not subject to any exemption under the Act. It thereby failed to comply with its duty under s.1(1)(b) of the Act within the time limit prescribed by s.10. 20Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 c. That the Council failed to identify within 20 working days of the request the exemptions upon which it relied in respect of certain documents falling within the scope of Dr. Bowbrick’s request. It thereby failed to comply within its duty under s.17(1) of FOIA within the time limit prescribed by that section. 70. Because of the unsatisfactory way the disclosures have taken place, as is reflected in our findings on costs below, we would recommend that the IC uses its powers under s.48 FOIA to make a practice recommendation to the Council specifying steps which in the Commissioner’s opinion the Council should take in order for it conform with the codes of practice under ss.45 and 46 of FOIA. In relation to this recommendation we are mindful of the fact that Dr Bowbrick has made further requests of the Council and we are anxious that these requests do not result in further prolonged litigation. We would recommend that this exercise is undertaken expeditiously. Costs 71. During this case the Tribunal has had real difficulty in understanding how the Council could have issued the Refusal Notice in the form it did. It is difficult to imagine circumstances where a public authority transferring a school to another organisation holds no information relating to that transfer. This is why the Tribunal joined the Council to this appeal and not surprisingly soon after the October Hearing, information materialised. It took another directions hearing for further information to be provided and at this hearing yet further information has been disclosed. 72. What worries this Tribunal is that soon after the Request, Jeremy Lyn-Cook sent an internal memo in relation to information held by the Education Department only, to Mr Stead dated 25th January 2005 indicating that Dr Bowbrick’s “enquiry is very wide and could run into 6-7 lever arch files relating to the consultation on the closure of MGB and the expansion of Bluecoat.” He continued “it will probably take more than 2 days to extract information from the files and therefore, I think he needs to be more specific about what he wants.” There is no evidence that Mr Stead enquired of any other department at this stage. This indicates to us that the Council always knew that they held information relating to the Request. Dr Bowbrick on his own 21Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 initiative offered to help the Council locate the information but his offer was not pursued. What followed was the Refusal Notice stating, in effect, that no information was held. 73. Quite frankly the Tribunal is dismayed at the way the Request has been handled and the conduct of the Council since the commencement of this appeal. The Council appears to have misled Dr Bowbrick and then the IC during his investigation. 74. The Chairman of this Tribunal has sought assurances from the IC at the October Hearing that future complaints would be investigated with more diligence than this case and has received those assurances in a letter to the Chairman of the Tribunal dated 21st October 2005 and in the witness statement of Mr Gerrard Tracey, Assistant Commissioner, dated 28th February 2006 . Also from the moment that it was clear that the Council held information the subject of the Request the Commissioner has accepted that his Decision Notice could not stand and has co- operated with the Tribunal. 75. The same cannot be said of the Council following the Joinder Notice. The Council did not comply with the direction in the notice. Following the disclosures in October 2005 it did not respond to Dr Bowbrick’s analysis of the disclosure which clearly indicated that further investigation was necessary, which then necessitated holding the December Hearing. The Council then made further disclosure but not in a timely way so that it could be considered at that hearing, so a further response was required from Dr Bowbrick after the December Hearing. The Council did not seek to take any further action in relation to this response before the Full Hearing some 6 months later, when it did eventually properly co-operate through the good offices of its Counsel, Mr Jones, after which further disclosures have been made. In the meantime there have been substantial claims for exemption of information, the most recent being after the adjournment of the Full Hearing. In addition there has been duplication of disclosures, giving cause for confusion. It has taken nearly 21 months since Dr Bowbrick’s request to undertake anything like a proper investigation and only after various Tribunal orders and prompting. 76. Dr Bowbrick has applied for costs against both the IC and the Council. The Tribunal’s power to make a costs order is set out in rule 29 of the Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005 (""IT Rules""), which provide as follows: ""(1) In an appeal before the Tribunal … the Tribunal may make an order awarding costs - 22Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 (a) against the appellant and in favour of the Commissioner where it considers that the appeal was manifestly unreasonable; (b) against the Commissioner and in favour of the appellant where it considers that the disputed decision was manifestly unreasonable; (c) where it considers that a party has been responsible for frivolous, vexatious, improper or unreasonable action, or for any failure to comply with a direction or any delay which with diligence could have been avoided, against that party and in favour of any other. (2) The Tribunal shall not make an order under paragraph (1) above awarding costs against a party without first giving that party an opportunity of making representations against the making of the order. (3) An order under paragraph (1) may be to the party or parties in question to pay to the other party or parties either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by that party or parties in connection with the proceedings or the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed). (4) Any costs required by an order under this rule to be taxed may be taxed in the county court according to such of the scales prescribed by the county court rules for proceedings in the county court as shall be directed by the order."" 77. Costs are defined in rule 3(2) of the IT Rules to include ""fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration"". 78. The Tribunal can only award costs against a ""party"". Party is defined in rule 3(3) of the IT Rules to mean 'the appellant, or the Commissioner, or a person joined to an appeal in accordance with Rule 7 …"". The Council has been a party to the appeal proceedings following the Tribunal's rule 7 Joinder Notice at the outset of the proceedings. The Tribunal is therefore authorised to make a costs award against it as well as the IC. 79. Rule 29(1)(3) authorises the Tribunal to make an award of costs against a party and in favour of any other in three circumstances: (1) where ""it considers"" that the party has been ""responsible for frivolous, vexatious, improper or unreasonable action"" or; (2) for ""any failure to comply with a direction"" or; (3) for ""any delay which with diligence could have been avoided"". 80. On the facts of this case, the Council’s failure to conduct a reasonable search for documents and to consider and discharge its obligations under FOIA at the time the request was first submitted by Dr Bowbrick has, at the very least, ""caused delays which with diligence could have been 23Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 avoided"". The subsequent piecemeal provision of information in our view justifies further criticism of the Council’s behaviour. 81. The Council has clearly failed to “comply with a direction”. There have been a number of orders where it has failed to meet the date by which the order should have been complied with. 82. In relation to the first circumstance in rule 29(1)(3) this has, in analogous situations, been considered by tribunals with similar provisions to rule 29. The Financial Services and Markets Tribunal, in a written decision from April 2006 (Baldwin v FSA, Case Number Fin/2005/0011), stressed that it could and should be distinguished from an administrative court charged with applying the Wednesbury unreasonableness test (that is the test formulated for the purpose of determining whether a public authority has acted outside its statutory powers). According to Andrew Bartlett QC, Chairman of the FSMT, “the Tribunal, unlike the court in the Wednesbury case, is expressly directed by paragraph 13 to make its own judgment of what is reasonable: “(1) If the Tribunal considers that a party … has … acted unreasonably”. 83. The FSMT, following a review of the facts, concluded that, in its opinion, the investigation at issue in the proceedings had not been unreasonable and made no order for costs against the FSA. Its approach to the application of its power to award costs contained in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Schedule 13 paragraph 13 is summed up in its conclusion at paragraph 27 of the decision: “Taken analytically item by item, and with the benefit of hindsight, it might be possible to characterise some of the elements of conduct … as unreasonable. But we think it important in this case to keep in mind also the broader picture and not to over-emphasize the significance of any individual feature of the investigation. We also remind ourselves that a wrong view or approach is not necessarily an unreasonable view or approach …” 84. In an earlier case, a differently constituted FSMT appeared to have been guided by the basic, if elusive, principle of ""fairness"". In Davidson v the FSA (30 July 2004) (the notorious ""Plumber case""), the FSMT, although recognising that it could only make a costs order if a party acted unreasonably, noted that ""fairness"" had been a consideration in its review of the facts and its decision of how much the party should be ordered to pay. (There it made an order that the FSA pay 50% of the costs.) 85. The EAT has made costs orders against parties where it has determined that the party's conduct was unreasonable. For example, the EAT has awarded costs against an appellant where the facts indicated that the appellant delayed in withdrawing or abandoning proceedings, or proceeded with unmerited actions contrary to legal advice, or failed to fully engage with the proceedings once the proceedings had commenced. 86. The Tribunal finds that Council, through the offices of Mr Stead, purposefully chose not to carry out a proper investigation, despite being aware that there was a likelihood that the Education Department alone held substantial amounts of information in relation to the Request. 24Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 The Tribunal considers this amounts to ""improper or unreasonable action"". However we are mindful of the considerations taken by other tribunals as set out above in relation to similar powers. The Request was a very early request under FOIA and the Council was no doubt getting to grips with its obligations under the Act and therefore we are not prepared to go so far at to find that the action taken was also “frivolous or vexatious” under rule 29(1)(3). 87. In contrast the Tribunal finds that none of the circumstances set out under rule 29(1)(3) apply to the IC’s conduct. 88. In view of the above findings the Tribunal has decided not to make an order for costs against the IC, but that we will make a cost order against the Council in favour of Dr Bowbrick. 89. Rule 29 provides that the Tribunal can make an order that one party or parties pay ""the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed)"". The Tribunal therefore can direct that the public authority should pay only a portion or part of the costs if it, in its discretion, considers it appropriate to do so following its review of the evidence. Rule 29 requires that parties be given an opportunity to make representations on the award of costs before the Tribunal makes its order. It is open to the parties to agree on the amount of costs and there is no reason why the Tribunal should not encourage them to do so. The Tribunal has already given the opportunity for the parties to do this in the June Order and they have so obliged. The Tribunal has taken these representations into account in coming to its decision set out in the previous paragraph. The Tribunal considers that the parties are so far apart in relation to the amount of costs that there is no point in inviting them to seek agreement and that therefore the matter should go immediately for taxation. 90. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to make any finding on the amount of costs before it orders taxation but it may direct that the public authority should pay only a portion of the applicant’s costs. In the Davidson decision, [cited above], the FSMT first directed, following its review of the facts, that “fairness” required that the FSA pay only half of the applicant’s costs but it expressed no view as to the amount of such costs to be awarded preferring to leave it to be assessed on the standard basis by a costs official. 91. In this case the Tribunal directs that the Council should pay the whole of Dr Bowbrick’s costs. 92. On the issue of taxation, rule 29(4) provides that: “Any costs provided by an order under this rule to be taxed may be taxed in the county court according to such of the scales prescribed by the county court rules for proceedings in the county court as shall be directed by the order.” 93. The county court scales have been replaced by the CPR. CPR 47 sets out the procedure for detailed assessment of costs. According to CPR 47, proceedings are commenced when the receiving party serves on the paying party a notice of commencement and a copy of the bill of costs (CPR 47.6). The receiving party has three months from the date of the Tribunal's order to 25Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 commence proceedings (CPR 47.7). In addition, the costs recoverable by a LIP are set out in CPR 48.6 and as indicated below, these make provision for the recovery of financial loss. 94. The Tribunal directs that Dr Bowbrick’s costs be taxed as a litigant in person (LIP). 95. Alternatively according to rule 29(3), the Tribunal could have made an order: ""to the party or parties in question to pay to the other party or parties either (1) a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by that party or parties in connection with the proceedings; or (2) the whole or part of such costs as taxed (if not otherwise agreed)."" 96. The Tribunal has decided not to make such an order for a specified sum but for future guidance sets out the basis upon which such an award could be made and also other matters to take into account when considering an award for costs. 97. The Tribunal is authorised to order the payment of a ""specified"" or lump sum to the applicant but only in ""in respect of the costs incurred … in connection with the proceedings"". The limitation of the award to costs ""incurred in connection with the proceedings"" is important. ""The proceedings"" in this context means the appeal before the Tribunal and it does not automatically include costs incurred by the applicant as a result of the public authority's conduct prior to the proceedings or petitioning the IC prior to the commencement of the appeal. 98. This issue was also considered by the FSMT in Baldwin (cited above). The relevant provision in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 provides that "" … it may order [a party] … to pay … the costs and expenses incurred … in connection with the proceedings"". In this case the FSMT was asked to consider whether 'conduct' before the proceedings could be considered in the determination of costs against a party. The FSMT concluded that had the intention been to limit the conduct referred to in the course of the proceedings, the statutory wording would have said so expressly. It concluded that it was entitled to take account of conduct which took place before the reference was made and the proceedings commenced (paragraph 23 of the decision). However, the FSMT also noted at paragraph 26 that its: ""conclusion does not mean that conduct prior to the proceedings is necessarily relevant to the incidence of costs … to be relevant under paragraph 13(1), it must have some bearing on the proceedings. It follows from the very nature of the decision to be taken on costs that our judicial discretion must be exercised on the basis of facts connected with or leading up to the proceedings, as contrasted with conduct wholly unconnected with the proceedings"". 99 .Although rule 29 clearly provides that the Tribunal may order the payment of costs where the conduct of another party has been such that an award against it is merited, rule 3(2) defines costs to include fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration. There is no provision for ""punitive"" damages or other means of ""punishing"" the offending party. 26Appeal Number: EA/2005/0006 100. Therefore, should the Tribunal elect to award a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by an applicant, it is clear that its order must relate to the categories of costs defined in rule 3(2) and as required by rule 29, and its order must be limited to those costs incurred by the applicant in connection with the proceedings. 101. The Tribunal should require an applicant to provide it with a schedule of costs incurred in connection with the proceedings which it can then use to inform its decision of what it considers to be an appropriate ""sum"" to award, given the specific circumstances of the case and with a view to ensuring a balanced and fair process for all parties. The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (""CPR"") requires litigants in person to evidence their costs and it would seem reasonable, and indeed fair in the circumstances, for the Tribunal to require some evidence of the applicant's costs in proceedings before it. In addition, the party against which costs are being sort has a right to make representations against the making of the order and the amount of such costs and this includes an opportunity to comment on an applicant’s schedule of costs.. 102. Rule 3(2) permits the Tribunal to include remuneration in its award of costs but it is not clear if it permits the Tribunal to compensate an applicant for lost earnings or to “remunerate” the applicant’s work in connection with the proceedings. The recent decision of the Costs Judge, Master Simons, in Knight v Maggioni (10 April 2006, Case Number 0503654) in an application for costs by a LIP, reaffirmed the position as set out in the CPR that an applicant claiming financial loss must quantify that loss with some degree of specificity. In this case, the applicant could not prove financial loss. He was therefore only compensated at a rate of £9.25 per hour for time spent preparing for and attending the proceedings, as prescribed by section 52 of the CPR Practice Direction about Costs Directions. Where it is exercising its discretion to award a specified sum to a party, the Tribunal is not bound by the provisions of the CPR but there is no reason why it cannot look to it as a guide to its own awards under rule 29, should it think it appropriate to make provision for remuneration in its costs award against a party.

REASONS A: Introduction 2. These appeals concern a number of statutory notices served on Leave.EU Group Limited (“Leave.EU”) and Eldon Insurance Services Limited (“Eldon”) by the Information Commissioner on 1 February 2019. 3. Both Leave.EU and Eldon lodged Notices of Appeal with the Tribunal. The appeals were directed to be heard together. 4. The Tribunal held an oral hearing on 9, 10 and 11 December 2019 and reserved its Decision, which we now provide. We considered a hearing bundle of 1400 pages, two volumes of legal materials, heard oral evidence and legal submissions. We are grateful to both counsel for their clear written and oral submissions. B: Factual Background 5. Leave.EU is a limited company established for cross-party political purposes, created to campaign in support of the UK exiting the European Union. Eldon is a limited company providing insurance services, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. It provides some insurance products under the brand name of “GoSkippy”. These two companies are distinct legal entities but also both members of a corporate group. The majority shareholder of the group’s parent company is Mr Arron Banks, who is also the sole subscriber of Leave.EU. The companies have some directors in common. Ms. Elizabeth Bilney is the Chief Executive Officer of both companies. Some members of Eldon staff were seconded to work for Leave.EU during the referendum campaign. At the time of the events giving rise to these appeals, the two companies were physically located in the same premises, although this is no longer the case. Another group company known as Rock Services Limited provided 2centralised management support services to both companies when they were based at the shared premises. 6. Leave.EU was incorporated in 2015, originally under the name of “TheKnow.EU”. Another company within the corporate group, “Better for the Country Limited”, provided advice to Leave.EU in connection with the EU referendum. Its directors include Mr Banks, Ms Bilney and Mr Andrew Wigmore. The Information Commissioner served a £50,000 Monetary Penalty Notice (“MPN”) on Better for the Country Limited in June 2016 in relation to its transmission of 500,000 unsolicited text messages during the referendum campaign. 7. The Information Commissioner commenced a large-scale investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes, known as Operation Cederberg, in May 20171. That investigation is of significant public interest. The Commissioner has published reports to inform the public and Parliament of the progress of her investigation, which is on-going. During the course of that investigation, concerns relating to Leave.EU and Eldon came to the Information Commissioner’s attention. In particular, the Commissioner was concerned to establish whether the personal data of Eldon’s insurance customers had been used in connection with political campaigning by Leave.EU. She also wanted to know about the nature of any work which Leave.EU had undertaken with the now notorious entity, Cambridge Analytica. Many of these concerns arose from public statements made by Mr Banks and his associates, as follows: (i)Mr Banks issued a press release in response to the Better for the Country MPN in June 2016 which was headed “a heartfelt apology” but the body of the document as it concerned the Information Commissioner was the single word “Whatever”; (ii) Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica held a joint press conference in November 2015; (iii) Mr Banks wrote in his book “The Bad Boys of Brexit” that he had hired Cambridge Analytica in October 2015; that another company called Goddard Gunster had been able to “mine” a database; that he had used telephone polling and targeting; and that “Big Data” had given Leave.EU an advantage in the referendum campaign; (iv) Mr Banks tweeted “AI won it for leave” in January 2017; (v) Mr Wigmore tweeted that Leave.EU had used “bots” and “AI” to target specific groups; (vi) Mr Wigmore commented in an interview in October 2017 that he was working with a University in Mississippi, which was the world-wide centre for artificial intelligence. 1 Operation Cederberg was described by the Upper Tribunal in UKIP v The Information Commissioner (Information Notice) [2019] UKUT 62 (AAC). 38. The Information Commissioner asked Leave.EU a series of questions about these statements and also about e-mail exchanges between Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica which she had obtained during the investigation. She served a number of Information Notices on Leave.EU and Eldon. 9. Leave.EU has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to its processing of personal data. It told the Information Commissioner that it had not in fact hired Cambridge Analytica (contrary to the public statement made to that effect), and that it had not used Eldon’s customer data for political purposes. The Commissioner made inquiries, but ultimately found no evidence that the personal data of UK citizens had been transferred to the University in Mississippi. Her involvement in legal proceedings relating to the University was the subject of threatened judicial review by Mr Banks, however the application was not pursued. 10. On 14 June 2018, Mr Banks wrote directly to the Information Commissioner. He said that the purpose of his letter was to summarise for her the evidence he had that week given to the Digital Culture Media and Sport Select Committee hearing. Much of that letter relates to litigation in Mississippi, in relation to which he asked the Information Commissioner to disclose to him documents that she had received. He stated that: “It will have been clear from our oral evidence given at the hearing that some of the statements made by myself and Andy Wigmore in promoting the campaign were prone to exaggeration and attention seeking in order to drive publicity for the Leave.EU campaign. This boastfulness and overstatement was driven and accentuated in part by the increased media focus surrounding the leave campaign and the competition to outdo the Vote Leave and Remain campaigns.” 11. There followed an exchange of correspondence in which the Information Commissioner described her investigations as on-going and Mr Bank accused her of undertaking “politically motivated” actions. He concluded “We will therefore now have to take steps outside of our correspondence with you, which has to date been private, to ascertain the true facts surrounding the ICO’s behaviour and to establish what remedies are open to us. I would, however, make the point that both I and the companies associated with me have and will continue to co-operate with your investigations, to the extent that they are carried out in accordance with due process. As ever, we fully reserve our rights in relation to this matter”. 12. On 5 November 2018, the Information Commissioner served a statutory Notice of Intent to serve a Monetary Penalty on GoSkippy/Eldon (bundle p.238). This Notice explains that she considered that Eldon had breached Regulation 22 of The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (“PECR”) 2 by instigating the transmission of 1,069,852 unsolicited direct marketing communications, transmitted by Leave.EU, which advertised GoSkippy Insurance. 2 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made 4The Information Commissioner had concluded that GoSkippy did not have the necessary valid consent from recipients to receive this information. The contravention was found to have been serious in view of the high number of emails sent and the Information Commissioner found that GoSkippy knew or ought to have known that the communications breached PECR but had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the breach. The MPN which she was minded to serve was £60,000. 13. On the same date, the Information Commissioner served a Preliminary Enforcement Notice on Eldon (bundle p. 251). This states that the Information Commissioner was satisfied there had been a breach of PECR (as set out in the Notice of Intent to serve the MPN) and that she was minded to serve an Enforcement Notice requiring Eldon/GoSkippy to take specified steps to comply with Regulation 22 of PECR. 14. Also on 5 November 2018, the Information Commissioner served on Leave.EU a Notice of Intent to serve a Monetary Penalty (bundle p.261). She specified the reason for this as having found a contravention of PECR Regulation 22 by Leave.EU in transmitting 1,069,852 direct marketing emails containing advertising for GoSkippy. These communications were unsolicited and lacked the requisite consent. The contravention was found to have been serious in view of the high number of emails sent and the Information Commissioner found that Leave.EU knew or ought to have known that the communications breached PECR but had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the breach. The MPN which she was minded to serve was £60,000. 15. Eldon and Leave.EU both made representations in response to the “minded to” letters. Eldon complained that the Information Commissioner had publicised the serving of the Notice of Intent and Preliminary Enforcement Notice before receiving its representations. Eldon suggested, inter alia, that it was Leave.EU which had both instigated the transmission of and transmitted the offending electronic communications. Leave.EU’s representations also asserted that Eldon had not instigated the transmission of the emails. 16. The Information Commissioner subsequently decided to serve the MPNs that we are considering in these appeals3 (bundle p.410 Eldon, p. 447 Leave.EU) on the basis that Leave.EU and Eldon had both breached the requirements of Regulation 22 PECR by including in 1,069,852 emails (consisting of 21 separate newsletters sent between August 2016 and July 2017), sent to Leave.EU subscribers, a promotional discount for GoSkippy insurance. The MPNs stated the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that Leave.EU was the transmitter of the emails and Eldon/GoSkippy was the instigator of that transmission. She confirmed the level of penalty as £60,000 for Eldon but reduced it to £45,000 for Leave.EU having reviewed its accounts. 17. The Information Commissioner also on 1 February 2019 served Assessment Notices4 requiring both Eldon and Leave.EU to permit the Information Commissioner 3 ENF0784640 – appeal EA/2019/0056 and ENF0784731 – appeal EA/2019/0057 4 Appeals EA/2019/0054 and 0059 5to carry out an assessment of whether they have complied or are complying with the data protection legislation (bundle page 440 Eldon, p.468 Leave.EU). The scope of the assessments differ in that Eldon’s Assessment Notice refers to personal data held for (a) the provision of insurance services, (b) direct marketing and (c) lead generation whereas Leave.EU’s Assessment Notice refers to personal data held for (a) direct marketing and (b) lead generation. The Assessment Notices had not been presaged by “minded to” letters, as this is not required under DPA 2018. 18. The Information Commissioner also on that date served an Enforcement Notice5 on Eldon only (bundle p. 429) for the stated purpose of requiring Eldon to refrain from sending unsolicited direct marketing communications without consent. The Enforcement Notice was served under s.40 DPA19986. 19. A further MPN was served on Leave.EU (item (vi) in paragraph 1 above). This was the subject of an appeal which was withdrawn by Leave.EU7, so we do not need to consider that appeal in this Decision and the MPN stands. However, we note that this MPN related to the transmission by Leave.EU of 296,522 emails in September 2015. These emails were sent to a mailing list which included Eldon customers who had not subscribed to Leave.EU. This event was described by Leave.EU as a one-off administrative error involving s shared Mailchimp account. Leave.EU initially asserted that it had reported this data breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office at the time of the data breach, but it later transpired that this had not been the case. 20. Eldon and Leave.EU both lodged Notices of Appeal with the Tribunal, in which they relied on grounds of appeal that the Information Commissioner had made errors of law in issuing all the statutory notices. Alternatively, that her discretion ought to have been exercised differently. They also relied on grounds of procedural unfairness and apparent bias, including the making of an inaccurate statement to a Parliamentary Select Committee (which the Information Commissioner accepts to have been the case), and the allegedly unwarranted publication by the Information Commissioner’s Office of statements about the Notices of Intent. Later, the disclosure of an exchange of emails between the Information Commissioner and the Deputy Information Commissioner prompted an (unopposed) application by the Appellants to amend their grounds of appeal to include an allegation of bias by the Information Commissioner. Mr Stephen Eckersley, the Information Commissioner’s Director of Investigations, commented on these complaints in his second witness statement, referred to below. 21. Elizabeth Bilney’s evidence to the Tribunal was that the public statements from Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore about artificial intelligence, Cambridge Analytica, and the disrespectful “Whatever” statement could not be relied upon as factually correct. She asked the Tribunal to rely instead on her own role in co-operating fully with the 5 Appeal EA/2019/0058 6 Section 40 DPA 1998 continued in effect for the purposes of enforcing PECR following the enactment of DPA 2018 – see paragraph 28 (1), schedule 20 to DPA 2018. 7 Appeal EA/2019/0055 6Information Commissioner’s investigation and providing it with evidence of both companies’ compliance with data protection legislation. She repeatedly expressed the view that Eldon does not use direct marketing and that it had not therefore needed to consider its compliance with PECR. We note that the absence of complaints about the emails was a mitigating factor expressly taken into account by the Information Commissioner in determining the appropriate level of financial penalty, but that Ms Bilney, having initially told the Information Commissioner that there had been no complaints, later accepted that she had received two “grumbles” about the e mails (considered below at paragraph 47). 22. Prior to the hearing, the parties’ counsel agreed between them a list of issues which they suggested the Tribunal should decide in these appeals. We have addressed them to the extent we considered them relevant, having considered all the evidence. The list included questions of whether the emails to Leave.EU subscribers containing the GoSkippy discount information as a matter of law constituted unsolicited direct marketing which contravened PECR, and the extent to which the alleged procedural unfairness by the Information Commissioner’s Office could be cured by a “full merits” appeal hearing before this Tribunal. C: The Law (i)Monetary Penalty Notices 23. The MPNs in this case were issued pursuant to s. 55A of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”)8. S.55B(5) DPA 1998 confers a right of appeal to this Tribunal on a person upon whom such an MPN is served. The appeal may be against (a) the decision to issue the MPN and/or (b) the amount of the penalty. The Appellants’ Grounds of Appeal in this case engage both limbs (a) and (b). 24. By virtue of article 7 of the Data Protection Act (Monetary Penalties) Order 2010 , the s. 55B(5) right of appeal is to be determined in accordance with s. 49 DPA 9 1998. This provides that the Tribunal shall allow the appeal and (“or”) substitute another Notice if the Notice is “not in accordance with the law” or to the extent that the Commissioner exercised her discretion, it should have been exercised differently. 25. The MPNs were issued on the basis that both companies had breached regulation 22 of PECR, which provides as follows: “22 (1) This regulation applies to the transmission of unsolicited communications by means of electronic mail to individual subscribers. (2) Except in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (3), a person shall neither transmit, nor instigate the transmission of, unsolicited communications for the purposes 8 S. 55A DPA 1998 as amended by schedule 1 PECR http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/part/VI/crossheading/monetary-penalties 9 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2010/9780111490723 7of direct marketing by means of electronic mail unless the recipient of the electronic mail has previously notified the sender that he consents for the time being to such communications being sent by, or at the instigation of, the sender. (3) A person may send or instigate the sending of electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing where— (a)that person has obtained the contact details of the recipient of that electronic mail in the course of the sale or negotiations for the sale of a product or service to that recipient; (b)the direct marketing is in respect of that person’s similar products and services only; and (c)the recipient has been given a simple means of refusing (free of charge except for the costs of the transmission of the refusal) the use of his contact details for the purposes of such direct marketing, at the time that the details were initially collected, and, where he did not initially refuse the use of the details, at the time of each subsequent communication. (4) A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention of paragraph (2).” 26. In Microsoft Corporation v McDonald (trading as Bizads) [2006] EWHC 3410 (Ch) , Lewison J (as he then was) considered the meaning of instigation for the 10 purposes of regulation 22 PECR. He concluded at [13] that: “The Regulations apply to prevent not only the transmission of electronic mail but also the instigation of such transmission. What is the meaning of the word ‘instigate’? Mr Vanhegan, who appears on behalf of Microsoft, submits that it has its ordinary dictionary definition which includes urging or inciting somebody to do something. I accept that submission. I do, however, consider that to urge or incite somebody to do something requires something more than the mere facilitation of the action concerned; it requires, in my judgment, some form of positive encouragement”. 27. PECR regulation 2 provides that expressions used in PECR which are not defined in regulation 2 (1) have the meaning given to them in DPA 1998 or, if not there defined, in Directive 2002/58/EC (the E-Privacy Directive)11. Section 11(3) DPA 1998 defines “direct marketing” as “the communication (by whatever means) of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to particular individuals”. Article 2 (f) of the E-Privacy Directive provides that “consent” by a user or subscriber corresponds to the data subject’s consent in Directive 95/46/EC (the Data Protection Directive)12. The Data Protection Directive provides at Article 2 (h) that: 10 http://juriscom.net/wp-content/documents/highcourtjce20061212.pdf 11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:en:HTML 12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046 8“‘the data subject’s consent’ shall mean any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed”. 28. Section 160 DPA 2018 requires the Information Commissioner to publish a Regulatory Action Policy giving guidance about how she proposes to exercise her functions under the DPA 2018. This was published in November 201813. It was disputed before us whether it applies to Notices served under the auspices of DPA 1998. 29. Section 55A DPA 1998, as amended, provides that the Information Commissioner has discretion to issue an MPN where she: “…is satisfied that— (a) there has been a serious contravention of the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communication (EC Directive) Regulations 2003; and (b) subsection (2) or (3) applies. (2) This subsection applies if the contravention was deliberate. (3) This subsection applies if the person— (a)knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that the contravention would occur but (b)failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.” (ii)Assessment Notices 30. The two Assessment Notices before us were issued pursuant to s. 146 DPA 201814. This provision empowers the Information Commissioner as follows: “(1) The Commissioner may by written notice (an “assessment notice”) require a controller or processor to permit the Commissioner to carry out an assessment of whether the controller or processor has complied or is complying with the data protection legislation. (2) An assessment notice may require the controller or processor to do any of the following— (a)permit the Commissioner to enter specified premises; (b)direct the Commissioner to documents on the premises that are of a specified description; (c)assist the Commissioner to view information of a specified description that is capable of being viewed using equipment on the premises; (d)comply with a request from the Commissioner for a copy (in such form as may be requested) of— (i)the documents to which the Commissioner is directed; (ii)the information which the Commissioner is assisted to view; 13 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 14 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/146 9(e)direct the Commissioner to equipment or other material on the premises which is of a specified description; (f)permit the Commissioner to inspect or examine the documents, information, equipment or material to which the Commissioner is directed or which the Commissioner is assisted to view; (g)provide the Commissioner with an explanation of such documents, information, equipment or material; (h)permit the Commissioner to observe the processing of personal data that takes place on the premises; (i)make available for interview by the Commissioner a specified number of people of a specified description who process personal data on behalf of the controller, not exceeding the number who are willing to be interviewed”. 31. An Assessment Notice carries a right of appeal, in identical terms to s. 49 DPA 1998, pursuant to ss. 162 and 163 DPA 2018.15 There is no statutory threshold for the service of an Assessment Notice, so the decision to issue such a notice lies within the Information Commissioner’s general discretion. As noted above, there is no requirement to serve a Notice of Intent prior to serving an Assessment Notice. (iii)Enforcement Notices 32. The Enforcement Notice, served on Eldon only, was issued pursuant to s. 40 DPA 199816. Such Enforcement Notices carry a right of appeal under s. 49 DPA 1998. 33. Section 40 DPA 1998 (as amended by PECR) empowers the Information Commissioner as follows: “(1) If the Commissioner is satisfied that a data controller has contravened or is contravening any of the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003…. , the Commissioner may serve him with a notice (in this Act referred to as “an enforcement notice”) requiring him, for complying with the …requirements in question, to do either or both of the following— (a) to take within such time as may be specified in the notice, or to refrain from taking after such time as may be so specified, such steps as are so specified, or (b) to refrain from processing any personal data, or any personal data of a description specified in the notice, or to refrain from processing them for a purpose so specified or in a manner so specified, after such time as may be so specified. 15 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/162 16 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/40/2016-07-22 10(2) In deciding whether to serve an enforcement notice, the Commissioner shall consider whether the contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage”. 34. The Enforcement Notice in this case was served on the basis that the Information Commissioner was satisfied there had been a breach of regulation 22 of PECR by Eldon. (iv)The role of the Tribunal 35. As noted above, the role of the Tribunal in hearing an appeal against an MPN, Enforcement or Assessment Notice is as described in s. 49 DPA 1998. The statutory wording used in s. 49 DPA 1998 also describes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in relation to appeals against Decision Notices issued by the Information Commissioner under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIRs”). The Upper Tribunal has confirmed that an appeal against a Decision Notice made under FOIA or EIRs is to be regarded as an appeal by way of re-hearing. The most recent and authoritative support for that approach may be found in the Decision of a three-judge panel of the Upper Tribunal (AAC) in Malnick v IC and ACOBA [2018] UKUT 72 (AAC)17. 36. In Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust v Information Commissioner [2013] UKUT 0551 (AAC)18, UTJ Wikeley described the FTT’s jurisdiction in considering MPN appeals as a “an appeal by way of a full merits review”. At [56] he advised the First-tier Tribunal to focus on whether the statutory conditions for issuing an MPN have been met and not to “painstakingly [follow] all the twists and turns of the Commissioner’s internal decision-making process”. 37. In UKIP v Information Commissioner (information notice) [2019] UKUT 62 (AAC)19 the Upper Tribunal considered the application of this “two-pronged” right of appeal in relation to the service of an Information Notice under s. 43 DPA1998 and applied the approach taken in Malnick. 38. The Tribunal’s approach to an appeal by way of a full-merits review is generally to follow R (Hope and Glory Public House Limited) v City of Westminster Magistrates' Court [2011] EWCA Civ 3120, which was approved by the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60 at [45]21. Such an approach requires the Tribunal to consider what weight 17 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ac3336440f0b60a4be86c2f/GIA_0447_2017-02.pdf 18 https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2013/551.html 19 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c88fda2ed915d50a9d5169d/GIA_2069_2018-00.pdf 20 http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/31.html 21 https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2015-0126-judgment.pdf. 11to attach to the Respondent’s reasons for making the decision under appeal and, if the appeal is to be allowed, substituting a fresh decision. This avoids the Tribunal determining such appeals on the basis of a review of the procedure adopted in making the Respondent’s own decision, as the ability for an independent judicial body such as this Tribunal to take a fresh decision is generally understood to be curative of procedural shortcomings by the administrative decision-maker. 39. However, the Appellants in this case relied on a (non-binding) first-tier preliminary issue ruling by Judge McKenna in Facebook Ireland Ltd and Facebook Inc v Information Commissioner EA/2018/025622. Judge McKenna there took the view at [19] to [21] that: “...having considered the issues most carefully, I am persuaded that in the particular circumstances of this case it would be fair and just for the Appellants’ Grounds of Appeal relating to procedural unfairness to be considered by the Tribunal. That is not to say that every information rights case before this Tribunal in which procedural impropriety is alleged should be permitted to take up the Tribunal’s time and increase the Information Commissioner’s costs in undertaking a procedural review. In the majority of cases the Tribunal may well take the view that its discretion should be exercised to exclude evidence and argument related to alleged procedural failings which can adequately be cured by the Tribunal in undertaking a “full merits review. …in this case I am satisfied that I should distinguish the operation of a monetary penalty regime and the imposition of a very substantial financial penalty from the FOIA and EIR cases relied on by Mr Pitt-Payne, where different issues were at stake. I accept that Central London Community Health Trust took a different approach in the context of an MPN, but it seems to me that UTJ Wikeley was there considering a more familiar type of procedural challenge and arguably a much less serious complaint than is made in this case. I consider that the authorities relied on by Ms Proops support the approach of agreeing to consider the most serious allegations of procedural unfairness even in the context of an appeal by way of rehearing. I am satisfied that the alleged bias and predetermination pleaded by counsel in this case falls into the most serious of categories. I conclude that fairness and justice require the Tribunal to consider whether the Appellants’ challenge strikes at the heart of the decision to issue the MPN so that that decision is not in accordance with the law or the discretion to issue it should have been exercised differently…” 22 Not published by the Tribunal but placed into the public domain here: https://panopticonblog.com/2019/07/10/the-facebook-appeal-and-procedural-grounds/ 1240. Judge McKenna granted Facebook permission to appeal in respect of that ruling, but the appeal was never heard by the Upper Tribunal because the parties entered into a consent order which disposed of the appeal. Meanwhile, UTJ Markus took the unusual step of publishing her refusal of permission to appeal in Our Vault Limited v Information Commissioner [2019] UKUT 369 (AAC)23 in which she stated at [14]: “Although I heard no submissions on the point, I acknowledge that the reasoning in Malnick of the powers of the First-tier Tribunal on allowing an appeal in a FOIA case (at [103]-[104]) may require some modification in a DPA case. This is because under FOIA the IC is obliged by law to issue a decision notice, but the same cannot be said of enforcement or monetary penalty notices under the DPA. However, that does not matter for present purposes. The unarguable position is that the First-tier Tribunal is required to stand in the shoes of the IC and it would be inconsistent with the wide scope of the tribunal’s duties and powers to conclude that, if the tribunal finds that there has been a procedural error by the IC, it must stop the appeal at that point. Section 49 enables the First-tier Tribunal to substitute a notice or decision. This shows that Parliament intended that, where there was a mistake by the IC (whatever the nature of that mistake – law, fact or procedure), the tribunal is to make the decision that the IC could have made”. 41. Mr Facenna, on behalf of the Appellants, sought to cast doubt on UTJ Markus’ categoric approach by drawing the Tribunal’s attention to the administrative law text book De Smith (8th Edition) at 8-045, where it is stated that “The question whether a decision vitiated by breach of the rules of fairness can be made good by a subsequent hearing does not admit of a single answer applicable to all situations in which the issue may arise. Whilst it is difficult to reconcile all the relevant cases, case law indicates that the courts are increasingly favouring an approach based in large part upon an assessment of whether, in all the circumstances of the hearing and the appeal, the procedure as a whole satisfied the requirement of fairness”. 42. He referred us to TalkTalk Telecom Group plc v Office of Communications [2012] CAT 124 at [131], in submitting that there is a category of cases in relation to which a fresh decision by the Tribunal on appeal could not cure a procedural deficiency by the original decision-maker, where that procedural deficiency was so serious as to render it unsafe for the Tribunal to conclude ‘on the merits’ that the right decision had been made. He also drew support for this approach from the Privy Council’s judgment in Calvin v Carr [1980] A C 574, in which Lord Wilberforce concluded at 593D that: 23 https://www.gov.uk/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/our-vault-limited-v-information- commissioner-gia-2019-ukut-369-aac 24 https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files/1.1186_TalkTalk_Judgment_CAT_1_100112.pdf 13“…there may be instances where the defect is so flagrant, the consequences so severe, that the most perfect of appeals or re-hearings will not be sufficient to produce a just result. Many rules (including those now in question) anticipate that such a situation may arise by giving power to remit for a new hearing. There may also be cases where the appeal process itself is less than perfect: it may be vitiated by the same defect as the original proceedings: or short of that there may be doubts whether the appeal body embarked on its task without predisposition or whether it had the means to make a full and fair inquiry, for example where it had no material but a transcript of what was before the original body. These are all matters (and no doubt there are others) which the court must consider”. 43. Mr Facenna referred us to Saini J’s judgment in R (Karagul) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWHC 3208 (Admin)25 where the court reviewed the principles of administrative fairness to be applied in cases where a public authority exercising a statutory power suspected that misrepresentations had been made to it during the course of its inquiries. Citing the Court of Appeal’s judgment in R (Balajigari) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 69326, Saini J concluded at [103] that there is a well-established principle requiring there to be an opportunity to address the alleged misrepresentation prior to a final decision being taken. D: Evidence (i)documentary evidence 44. We had in our hearing bundle the 21 emailed newsletters (bundle p.604-698). They each contain a GoSkippy promotional banner (in three differing styles) containing a hyperlink to the GoSkippy website and a clear offer of a 10% discount on GoSkippy products to Leave.EU supporters. We note that the text of the newsletters makes a humorous association between Skippy the kangaroo from the 1960s television show and the Leave.EU campaign, so that a kangaroo is depicted winning a boxing match by knocking out a cartoon Angela Merkel. The promotional offer builds on this link by describing itself as a “Brexit Skippy giveaway for Article 50 day”. Skippy is shown holding up his boxing medals under the banner “Skippy says an Aussie style points system is a winner”, and his medals have “GoSkippy Insurance” printed on them. The newsletters refer to the weekly news round-up being “brought to you by GoSkippy.com”. The initial August 2016 newsletter states “We are pleased to announce a sponsorship deal with GoSkippy Insurance to help fund our activities…” The 10% discount is described as a “Brexit Independence Policy”. Readers are also informed that Mr Banks is the co-founder of GoSkippy and invited to purchase his book. 25 https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2019/3208.html 26 https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/673.html 1445. Apart from the Skippy-related material, the newsletters contain pro-EU exit news and views presented in a tabloid style, plus opinion pieces from Mr Banks himself and some text and graphics devoted to other subjects, such as criticising the BBC and the Islamic religion. 46. Each newsletter contained a link to an “unsubscribe from this list” button. Each also included a statement on the last page as follows: “How we use your information: the information you provide will be used by Better for the Country Limited for the purposes of keeping you updated about our campaigns. The data controller for this information is Elizabeth Bilney. This information will be processed in accordance with …[DPA] by the company’s staff and may be passed to any of the other EU referendum ‘Leave’ campaigns. If you do not want the information you give to us to be passed to other ‘Leave’ campaign organisations, or for us to contact you, please indicate: I would not like to receive more information from Better for the Country Limited, I would not like to receive more information from other Leave campaign organisations. If you have any questions about how your information will be processed or about your rights under the DPA, please contact Elizabeth Bilney at Better for the Country Ltd ...”. 47. In answer to the Information Commissioner’s statutory Information Notice, Elizabeth Bilney had stated that no recipients of the emailed newsletters had complained about the GoSkippy offer being sent to them. By the time of the hearing this was accepted to have been incorrect and that two subscribers had complained to Leave.EU. One had stated that they had “subscribed for Brexit reasons, not for advertising insurance companies, now unsubscribed”. The other said “who gave leave.eu authority to use its supporters private personal details to be used as a mailing database for Go Skippy insurance. The use of this list in this way is both unethical and wholly inappropriate”. 48. Our bundle included several versions of a Privacy Policy relied on by Leave.EU. This was available to subscribers via a link on the Leave.EU web page. It stated that: “We use information held about you in the following ways…to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes… We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone. If you are a new registered supporter, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. …We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group… 15…You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us”. 49. It was common ground before us that Leave.EU had transmitted the newsletters containing the GoSkippy discount information. However, it was disputed whether Eldon had “instigated” that transmission for the purposes of regulation 22 PECR. The documentary evidence relied on by the Information Commissioner in that regard was a series of email exchanges between group company employees (bundle p.715 - 731). We note that they use either Leave.EU email addresses or Rock Services email addresses (sometimes both, interchangeably). These exchanges were with people using GoSkippy email addresses in August 2016. Ms Bilney was involved in some of them (using her Rock-Services and her Leave.EU email addresses). The exchanges included the following comments: “Arron would like the policy to say, ‘Brexit independence policy’ on it” and “Arron is reviewing the letter” and “Arron wants the discount on all skippy products not just car and home”. Later that month there is a further e mail exchange reporting that “Arron has told us to hold off sharing the Brexit deal via Leave.EU until further notice”. 50. The documentary evidence included internal documents from the ICO investigation. These included the notes of a meeting between ICO officers and Ms Bilney in April 2017 (bundle p.1168) at which she confirmed that Leave.EU had never in fact worked with Cambridge Analytica, despite the “spin and exaggeration” suggesting otherwise. We also have in our bundle the email exchanges between Cambridge Analytica and Leave. EU which prompted the ICO’s concerns (bundle p. 1177 – 1181). 51. We also have before us an email correspondence between the Information Commissioner and the Deputy Information Commissioner, referred to by Mr Eckersley in his first witness statement (bundle p.1192-1193). This exchange took place on the afternoon of Sunday 4 November 2018, the day before the service of the Notices of Intent. The Information Commissioner expresses her continuing concern about the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon, as follows: “I think there is much more to see here. One of the issues I think we need to look at through our continuing investigation and an audit is how insurance data may have been used in modelling for the polling done by Leave.EU. I have problems believing what we have been told. There was talk way back from Andy Wigmore about insurance actuaries being involved. We could try to talk to Eldon employees as well as they are now coming forward. James, has the FCA announced that they are going in to look at Eldon? Wonder if there would be any appetite for a joint or parallel audit which could be very powerful.” 52. The Deputy Information Commissioner replied: 16“Yes, we can factor that into the ongoing enquiries; with the audit the intention would be to see if FCA would be interested in being involved to ensure the finance conduct and DPA issues are all tied together (I think they will – they have been looking on and off at various entities for a while we understand); the advantage of the PECR fines now is that they also allow the FCA to look at issues by virtue of a regulatory outcome already having been achieved. We can pick that up with the FCA as part of the follow up to the report.” 53. The most significant body of documentary evidence before us was the correspondence between the Information Commissioner’s Office and Ms Bilney in response to a series of Information Notices. (As noted above, this included two responses which are now accepted to have been inaccurate, in respect of the claimed reporting of a previous data breach and in respect of complaints received about the GoSkippy e mails). 54. We also had before us the internal Data Protection Policy adopted by Leave.EU. We note that this policy provides staff with guidance on DPA but not on PECR. 55. Mr Facenna told the Tribunal that there was much additional documentary evidence which had been supplied to the ICO by his clients in response to numerous Information Notices, and complained that this evidence was not before us because the Information Commissioner did not include it in our bundle. He did not point to any particular piece of missing evidence or to any specific prejudice to his client from the exclusion of any evidence from the bundle. We take the view that it was open to the Appellants to supply us with any additional materials which they felt we should see before we made our decision on their appeals but that, with the benefit of legal advice, they decided to proceed with the hearing bundle prepared by the Information Commissioner. We do have power to direct the filing of additional evidence on our own initiative if we consider that it would be fair and just to do so, however we have not identified any particular additional evidence which we would like to direct to be filed before deciding these appeals. (ii)witness evidence 56. Elizabeth Bilney’s witness statement records that Arron Banks is not a director of Eldon and has no role in its day to day operations. She describes the decision to found Leave.EU and to locate it in the building in Bristol where several other of Mr Banks’ companies were located and where groups support services such as finance, IT, HR and marketing were provided centrally. She describes taking steps to ensure that Leave.EU operated separately from the other companies as follows: by using Gmail rather than Outlook, separate operating platforms (Eldon uses a specialist insurance platform whereas Leave.EU operated on an off-the-shelf electoral campaign platform), a shared server with segregated network drives which were “locked down and partitioned” with access only granted to limited authorised personnel. She said that when a new member of staff started work, their manager authorised the levels of access that they required for their role. She explained that Leave.EU’s call centre was based in Bristol, managed by an Eldon employee who was seconded to that role by a variation of their employment contract. GoSkippy’s call centre is based in South 17Africa. She describes both Eldon and Leave.EU as having robust data protection policies and practices, including a Data Protection Officer and access to external advice. 57. Ms Bilney describes in her witness statement the purpose of the Leave.EU newsletters as highlighting and promoting upcoming referendum-related events, fundraising activities and specific political issues. The newsletters were sent out using a distribution tool called Mailchimp. In September 2015, the shared use of Mailchimp by both companies led to an administrative error by a member of staff so that a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to some Eldon customers who had not subscribed to Leave.EU. This error was the subject of the £15,000 penalty referred to at paragraph 1 (vi) above. Ms Bilney confirmed that after that incident, Leave.EU and Eldon decided to operate separate Mailchimp accounts. 58. Ms Bilney describes the process for Leave.EU supporters to become subscribers to its newsletters as follows. They must click on a ‘newsletter sign-up’ button on the Leave.EU website and enter their contact details (bundle p. 710). They would then receive an email with a further link by which they could sign up to the newsletter (bundle p.711). They would not receive the newsletter unless they clicked the button indicating they wished to subscribe. In the period prior to the website going live in September 2015, she said that the website displayed a holding message so that people could leave their contact details there for Leave.EU to contact them once the campaign had launched. She exhibits to her witness statement screen-shots of the subscription journey, which we have described above. 59. Ms Bilney states in her witness statement that she discussed with Mr Banks the possibility of Leave.EU raising funds for its work by selling advertising space in its newsletters, offering products and services which may be of interest to Leave.EU subscribers. They decided to start with Eldon, to see if this approach would prove successful, by offering a 10% discount on GoSkippy insurance and monitoring the customer response. She stated that she had no commercial expectations of the promotion as it differed from the Eldon’s usual business model, and in the end a total of 788 policies were sold with the 10% discount, representing 0.4% of sales during the relevant period. Leave.EU then decided not to pursue the approach of selling advertising in its newsletters. 60. Ms Bilney told the Tribunal that she instructed a colleague called Pam Palmer, who had been seconded from Eldon to Leave.EU, to set up the discount code. The first newsletter containing the promotion was in August 2016 and the next one was in February 2017. Ms Bilney’s witness statement said that she does not recall the reason for the hiatus (although we note she was copied into the final email stating that Arron had asked for the Brexit deal to stop, referred to at paragraph 49 above). Her witness statement stated that there had been no formal contract between the two companies and no financial arrangement between them other than the discount code. However, in cross-examination she said that she thought there might have been a plan to impose an inter-company re-charge at the end of the financial year, but it was a pilot scheme only, aimed at investigating whether there was an income stream. Mr Knight put to her that the statement made to Leave.EU subscribers in the newsletter about the 18GoSkippy sponsorship “funding Leave.EU activities” was therefore untrue. She denied this, saying that if the pilot had been successful then there would have been a retrospective re-charge. 61. Ms Bilney’s evidence was that Eldon had no role in deciding when the GoSkippy promotion would be included in Leave.EU’s newsletters or how often it would be offered. Mr Knight put to her in cross examination that Mr Banks was driving force behind the policy, as the ultimate owner of Eldon. She replied that he was also the ultimate owner of Leave.EU. Asked by Mr Knight how staff knew which hat Mr Banks was wearing at any one time, she replied that they themselves differentiate which role they are in and fight for their own area. She added that the staff know which hat he is wearing. Ms Bilney accepted that the same member of staff had been shown to use different email accounts in the same correspondence. She did not think that the staff’s use of particular email accounts reflected who they were working for at any time, and they probably just used the email closest to hand. Mr Knight put to her that this reflected a lack of clarity as to roles within the group structure. Ms Bilney replied that the content was more important than the e mail address. She said that individual staff members had an authorised level of access to databases consistent with the needs of their role. This involved making changes in access rights when they were on secondment from one company to another. 62. Ms Bilney’s evidence was that the twenty-one newsletters in which the GoSkippy offer was included represented only a small proportion of the total number of Leave.EU newsletters sent. She said that, apart from the August 2016 newsletter, the other newsletters would have been sent even without the GoSkippy promotion. When asked by Mr Knight why none of the internal email exchanges mentioned the need to comply with PECR, she said they did not think it was relevant because they were not engaged in direct marketing. The audience for the emails were members of Leave.EU who had consented to be contacted, so she did not think the GoSkippy e mails were direct marketing. She accepted that staff had not been trained on the requirements of PECR, because they don’t do direct marketing, but her evidence was that the privacy policy was sufficient and had been drafted with the benefit of external advice. Asked by Mr Knight whether Mr Banks’ public statement of “Whatever” indicated that he did not care about regulatory compliance, she replied that “There was a lot of testosterone at the time”. 63. Ms Bilney’s witness statement explained at some length why she considered that reputational damage had been caused to Eldon as a result of the Information Commissioner’s actions. In cross examination, she accepted that she had presumed that Eldon’s loss of work from certain aggregators had been due to the ICO’s investigation. She said she did not know if Mr Banks’ public statements had been a factor in the loss of work. She feared that the audit required by the Assessment Notice would impact adversely on Eldon’s business and asserted that there had been a “disproportionate and politically-motivated approach to the use of the ICO’s auditing powers without any proper evidence base”. Cross examined about this statement, she said that she had said in her witness statement that the ICO was politically motivated because its actions felt unjust and they stemmed from Brexit. 1964. Ms Bilney included in her witness statement a number of her own opinions about the Information Commissioner’s investigation which might have been more appropriately addressed in legal submissions. Asked by Mr Knight why she had told the Information Commissioner that there had been no complaints about the GoSkippy emails, she said that she had categorised the responses (set out at paragraph 47 above) as “grumbles” rather than “complaints” and that she had been unaware of them when she gave her response to the Information Commissioner. Asked why she had said that the Mailchimp data breach had been reported to the ICO when it had not, she said she had made an error in that response but that there had been no attempt to mislead the ICO. 65. Stephen Eckersley, the Information Commissioner’s Director of Investigations, filed two witness statements for these appeals. In the first, he described the ICO’s statutory remit and the purpose and conduct of Operation Cederberg. He explains that he holds the “silver” lead role in that operation, reporting directly to the “gold” role held by the Deputy Information Commissioner. 66. Mr Eckersley’s witness statement describes the ICO’s engagement with Leave.EU and the service of a number of Information Notices. He states that the relationship between Better for the Country Limited and The Know and Leave.EU is still unclear, and that this had not been helpful in establishing regulatory compliance. He comments that: “The confusing picture presented by the responsible persons at Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services Limited was not helpful. Whilst the organisations sought to demonstrate compliance this was certainly not obvious – a situation…further exacerbated by media comments made by Arron Banks. I formed the view that the confusion may have been caused deliberately as it appeared indicative of Mr Banks’ lack of regard for the ICO’s regulatory action in light of the…fine recently issued to Better for the Country for breaches of PECR.” 67. Mr Eckersley refers in his witness statement to some internal ICO documents and to an email exchange between the Deputy Commissioner and the Information Commissioner about the proposal to issue the Assessment Notices. These emails were disclosed to the Appellants and contained in our hearing bundle. We have referred to them above. 68. Cross examined by Mr Facenna, Mr Eckersley described the unprecedented breadth of Operation Cederberg, involving 40 officers investigating 172 different organisations and engaging with the relevant authorities in other countries. He accepted that it was a high-profile investigation about data analytics for political purposes but that details of the Mailchimp incident for which Eldon had received a penalty had been included as an annexe to the ICO’s public report, despite there being no concerns about data sharing in the circumstances pertaining to that penalty. Mr Facenna took Mr Eckersley to internal ICO e mails (disclosed to the Appellants pursuant to a FOIA request) in which that publication decision had been queried by colleagues. Mr Eckersley replied that he had not been included in those exchanges 20and he had no role in the decisions about the press release of the report. In cross examination, Mr Eckersley said he thought there might be a further internal decision- making record that the Tribunal did not have before it. Mr Knight took instructions on that issue and told the Tribunal there was no such document. 69. Mr Eckersley accepted Mr Facenna’s suggestion that Ms Bilney had been co- operative during the ICO’s investigation. He added that the data compliance picture at Eldon and Leave.EU was somewhat confused but agreed that the investigation conducted for over a year had not found evidence to support the particular concerns expressed by the Information Commissioner in her email of 4 November. He confirmed he had not been a party to that e mail exchange. 70. In considering the GoSkippy emails, Mr Eckersley accepted that recipients had signed up to receive newsletters and always had the ability to unsubscribe from them. He accepted that no recipient would have been surprised to receive such a newsletter or indeed a special offer, as they had confirmed their willingness to receive these. However, Mr Eckersley explained that the ICO did not think the wording of the privacy notice was sufficiently precise to provide consent to the emails which were actually sent. He accepted that the ICO’s view about whether Eldon or Leave.EU had “instigated” the GoSkippy emails had changed over the course of the investigation. It was put to Mr Eckersley that a fuller explanation of the ICO’s thinking had been put to the Tribunal than had been set out for the Appellants at the time of the decision to serve the MPNs. Mr Eckersley said he did not think they had got to the bottom of the issues yet. 71. In his second witness statement, Mr Eckersley confirmed that he personally had made the decision to issue the Assessment Notices to Eldon and Leave.EU in his “silver investigations” role in Operation Cederberg, and that the decision to do so had not been taken by the Information Commissioner or the Deputy Information Commissioner. He stated that, in taking this decision, he was aware of a FCA’s regulatory interest but unaware of any proposal to conduct a joint audit so that this played no part in his decision-making. He refuted the allegation of bias made against the Information Commissioner personally and noted that she had not herself taken the decisions said to have been infected by bias. E: Submissions 72. Mr Facenna, on behalf of the Appellants, submitted that the Information Commissioner’s case was based on errors of law and/or the inappropriate exercise of discretion in the following respects: (i)Firstly, and most fundamentally, that the GoSkippy emails did not engage PECR at all, because they did not constitute unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing and that the Information Commissioner’s approach to the relevant law was wrong and without precedent. He submitted that the subscribers had signed up to receive newsletters, and indeed confirmed their consent to receive newsletters. They were told in every newsletter that they could unsubscribe and how their information would be used to provide you with 21information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes… (see paragraph 48 above). He submitted that all other PECR enforcement cases had involved ‘spam’ so that the Information Commissioner’s approach to these cases was uncharted territory. He referred the Tribunal to Article 13 of the E- Privacy Directive and suggested that its purpose was to prevent nuisance communications, rather than expected communications. (ii) If the GoSkippy emails did engage PECR, then he submitted that Eldon did not instigate their transmission by Leave.EU. He submitted that there was no evidence that Eldon had gone beyond mere facilitation, as required by the Microsoft judgment. He submitted that Eldon had no role in deciding whether when or how the emails would be sent and that Arron Banks had no authority to direct how that business was conducted. (iii) He submitted that Leave.EU subscribers had consented to receive the communications about GoSkippy. The Information Commissioner had accepted that the Privacy Policy in operation was the one understood to apply by subscribers (although in fact in the name of the wrong company). This told them that their data may be used to provide them with information about services which may be of interest to them. He submitted that whilst the MPNs had been served on basis that the Privacy Policy was not precise enough, the level of precision said by the ICO to be necessary was not in fact what the law required. He referred us to the First-tier Tribunal Decision in Xerpla Ltd v The Information Commissioner, in which the Tribunal had allowed an appeal against a MPN on the basis that the Appellant’s subscribers had consented to receive a wide range of information about discounts, deals, special offers and competitions. This Decision, of course, has no precedent value. (iv) That the sending of the GoSkippy emails was not a serious contravention of PECR and it is not the case that either Appellant ought to have known they would be in contravention of PECR, so as to satisfy the requirements for serving a MPN under s.55A DPA 1998. He submitted that, if there was a breach at all it was not serious in all the circumstances. The Information Commissioner had taken the wrong approach in considering the number of emails sent as the only factor in determining seriousness. It had been shown that not all of them had been opened in any event, and there was no evidence of damage or distress, so this was a de minimis intrusion of privacy. He submitted that the number of e mails sent gives a misleading impression of the seriousness of the contravention and suggested that if another data controller had acted this way, no regulatory action would have been pursued. Mr Facenna submitted that the Information Commissioner’s approach to this case represented a significant and novel extension of her powers. As these cases are unlike any other, he asked how it can be said that the Appellants knew or ought to have known that they had breached PECR? He submitted that they were entitled to believe they were acting within the law at the relevant time. He asked how Eldon could have known of the risk of contravention? It was reasonable for it to have proceeded on the basis that Leave EU was compliant with the law. 22(v) Mr Facenna submitted that the Information Commissioner ought to have exercised her discretion differently in respect of the MPNs because the imposition of the penalties, and the amount of the penalties, were disproportionate, inconsistent with her own published Regulatory Action Policy and with the decisions she had made in previous cases. Further, that the imposition of two MPNs in respect of the same conduct was irrational, as was the imposition of the larger penalty on Eldon who had engaged in no data processing at all. He complained of an absence of internal reasoning by the ICO as to the appropriate level of penalty and handed up a table comparing salient factors and level of penalty imposed in other cases. Mr Facenna asked the Tribunal, if it was satisfied that there should be a MPN on Leave EU at all, to find that it was too high. He submitted that there was no case for imposing a penalty on Eldon. Finally, he submitted that both Appellants had lost the opportunity of a discount for early payment as a result of bringing these appeals and that this was unfair. (vi) As to the Assessment Notices, Mr Facenna submitted that they are disproportionate, unprecedented, unfair and inconsistent with published guidance. He complained that there is no internal documentation recording the basis for serving the Assessment Notices. The historic concerns which had been identified (in fact, volunteered by the Appellants) had long ago been addressed. He submitted that the proposed audit of Eldon would cover its entire business, which went beyond the scope of the concerns which had been identified. He asked the Tribunal to limit the scope of Eldon’s audit to personal data concerned with direct marketing and lead generation only. He said he did not wish to criticise the Information Commissioner, who had clearly been unaware on 4 November that the concerns she retained had already been addressed. Her “more to see” approach was, in his submission, an inadequate basis for an audit and inconsistent with her own Regulatory Action Policy. He said she should be looking at the evidence rather than at Mr Bank’s “childish” statements. (vii) As to the Eldon Enforcement Notice, Mr Facenna submitted that this was disproportionate, inconsistent with published guidance and did not meet the requirements of s. 40 DPA 1998. He submitted that it merely required compliance with the law, so it was difficult to see the rationale for it. (viii) Finally, he submitted that the Information Commissioner had demonstrated the exercise of her discretionary powers for an extraneous purpose (namely the wish to involve the FCA), had taken into account irrelevant considerations about the Appellants’ involvement in the investigation into the use of data for political purposes, had failed to disclose her concerns to the Appellants so that they could fairly comment on them, and consequently that a fair-minded observer would conclude there was a real risk of bias in this investigation. Mr Facenna submitted that all these appeals should be allowed on the basis that the decisions taken were not in accordance with the law due to their procedural unfairness. Further, that in respect of the MPNs, it would be open to the Tribunal to make a fresh decision and substitute its own MPNs if it were satisfied that all the legal tests for doing so were met. However, in respect 23of the Assessment Notices and the Enforcement Notice, that the Information Commissioner’s investigation was so procedurally flawed that it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to make a fresh decision itself which involved relying on the Information Commissioner’s unfair process. 73. Mr Knight, on behalf of the Information Commissioner, asked the Tribunal to consider the context in which the Information Commissioner had decided to take regulatory action. This context included in his submission: more than one occasion on which Ms Bilney’s responses to Information Notices had been incorrect, suggesting a culture of non-compliance; a corporate group taking a two-faced approach to regulation so that Ms Bilney presented a compliant approach while Mr Banks took the “whatever” approach; a group in which senior figures admitted that they have lied to get attention; a history of non-compliance as demonstrated by the previous MPNs; a privacy policy in the name of the wrong company naming the wrong person as data controller; an accepted lack of training and procedures in relation to PECR; inadequate delineation of staff and director roles within the companies of the group; shared management services and secondments of staff between companies thus increasing risk of inappropriate access to customer data. 74. Responding to Mr Facenna’s submissions, he submitted as follows: (i)That the sending of the GoSkippy emails falls within regulation 22 of PECR because, as one email can contain different types of content, the focus of scrutiny must be on whether all of the content has been solicited. Taking into account the purpose of the E-Privacy Directive to prevent intrusion into citizens’ privacy, he submitted that there is an intrusion where they receive an email containing material which they did not consent to receive. He described the Appellants’ case as being that if you sign up to receive one type of e mail then that can be filled up with other material which you did not consent to receive. That approach, in his submission, drives a coach and horses through the PECR protections. He submitted that a spam sandwich nevertheless contains spam. He referred us to the ICO’s Direct Marketing Guidance27 at paras 95 and 96 which makes clear that an organisation passing on a third party’s material needs consent to do so. He suggested that the Appellants’ attempt to insert a primary purpose test into the direct marketing provisions of PECR is inconsistent with the law. (ii)Mr Knight submitted that the contemporaneous evidence referred to at paragraph 49 above shows that Leave.EU transmitted the emails at Mr Banks’ instigation. He submitted that Microsoft was the only authority which the Tribunal must apply in considering the question of instigation. He acknowledged that more evidence on this point was available to Tribunal than had been available to the Information Commissioner. He suggested that there were classic examples of instigation in the announcement of a “sponsorship deal”, and in Ms Bilney’s oral evidence that there would have been a re-charge 27 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1555/direct-marketing-guidance.pdf 24if the discount had produced an income stream. He submitted that it was clear that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney were both decision makers, but that Mr Banks had issued the demands in relation to the GoSkippy deal, and he could only have controlled those events as the ultimate owner of Eldon. There are blurred roles/emails/responsibilities in the group, but Mr Knight submitted that GoSkippy emails simply could not have happened without Eldon’s agreement. (iii)Mr Knight submitted that the purported consent of subscribers was not freely-given, specific and informed because they had consented to a Brexit newsletter so could not have given “informed” consent to receive the GoSkippy content. He referred us to the European Court of Justice’s judgment in Planet 49 GmbH28, in which it was held the test for whether appropriate consent had been given was case specific but that no ambiguity could be relied upon to imply such consent. He submitted that Leave.EU’s reliance on consent to receive “what we feel may interest you” was impermissibly ambiguous. (iv) Mr Knight submitted that the high number of emails sent (1,069,852) alone justified the Information Commissioner’s view that this was a serious contravention of PECR. It would not in his submission be appropriate to regard high-volume breaches as less serious where members of the public chose not to open their emails, as the purpose of the E-Privacy Directive is to protect them from receiving them in the first place. He submitted that the Tribunal should take the view that Leave.EU and Eldon both ought to have known that the emails were a breach of PECR because the Information Commissioner’s Direct Marketing Guidance was clear. Further, that ignorance of the law is not an acceptable excuse and there had already been regulatory action in respect of group activities involving such breaches so they were on notice of the requirements. It was, in his submission, extraordinary that, in the light of previous regulatory action, Ms Bilney persisted with the approach of saying that PECR was irrelevant to the group’s activities, so no steps had been taken to re- visit the company’s policies and guidance to staff to ensure future compliance. (v)Mr Knight submitted that both MPNs were a proportionate response to the breaches. There was a legitimate aim of promoting compliance, sanctioning breaches and having a deterrent effect. He noted that the Regulatory Action Policy had only been approved in November 2018 and that it was DPA-centric, however it contains reference to factors which are relevant here – the number of people affected, matters of public importance, a failure to take reasonable steps in connection with previous MPNs. He argued that the consistency assessment exercise contained in Mr Facenna’s table was not useful. (vi) Turning to the Assessment Notices, Mr Knight noted that there is a broad discretionary power, with no threshold for engagement. There is no requirement 28 C-673/17 http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-673/17&language=EN 25to seek representations in a “minded to” letter. An Assessment Notice is an investigatory tool, allowing the ICO to investigate “unknown unknowns”. This was, in his submission, a long way from a Karagul situation, with very different statutory regimes in play. There had also been no conclusion that the Appellants had lied, just a decision to go and make further checks. (vii)As to the Enforcement Notice, Mr Knight submitted that the threshold for making it had been met. Eldon had repeatedly asserted that it does not use direct marketing, but the Information Commissioner had concluded they needed to take steps to comply with PECR once they had decided to operate with Leave.EU in the way they had. There had been an internal recommendation to serve an Enforcement Notice on Leave.EU also, but this had not been proceeded with as Leave.EU had a more complicated picture in view of its obtaining of consent for the newsletter. (viii) Whilst it was common ground between counsel that, in conducting a full- merits review, the Tribunal could consider whether procedural irregularity rendered the decision not in accordance with the law, Mr Knight submitted that any such finding could be cured by the Tribunal taking a fresh decision on the evidence before it. He noted that the Appellants’ amended pleadings had relied on actual bias by the Information Commissioner but that, at the hearing, Mr Facenna had relied on apparent (or the appearance of) bias. He accepted that there were respects in which the Information Commissioner’s Office could have paid more attention to recording its decisions and that, in the case of the Assessment Notices in particular, the paper-trail leading up to the decision was absent. However, he noted that Parliament had not set any particular ‘threshold’ criteria for serving an Assessment Notice. He submitted that the Information Commissioner’s continuing concerns as at 4 November emails were in the context of the entire history of this investigation and these were sufficient for the Tribunal to uphold her exercise of discretion in serving the Notices. 75. Mr Knight noted that the Appellants’ case on bias had been diluted during the hearing. Mr Banks and Ms Bilney had both accused the ICO of bias in the correspondence and elsewhere. However, the test was whether an impartial observer would conclude there was a risk of bias and a conspiracy theorist is not an impartial observer. Mr Knight accepted that there was room for criticism of ICO’s internal processes in these appeals, but that a criticism of process is not sufficient to establish that the Information Commissioner’s actions were unlawful. They could be corrected by the Tribunal taking a fresh decision. F: Conclusions 76. We start our conclusions by considering the Appellants’ case on procedural unfairness by the Information Commissioner when taking the decisions before us. The way that this was put in the List of Issues agreed by counsel was to ask are the Notices….vitiated by procedural unfairness in the investigation…? We find it hard to reconcile the legal concept of vitiation (meaning, to rob the decisions of legal effect) in the context of a statutory scheme which involves an appeal by way of re-hearing. 26Following the wording of s. 49 DPA 1998, we note that, if the decisions are not in accordance with the law then our task is to re-make them on the basis of the evidence presented to us. We accept that the Tribunal should consider the procedural arguments put before us and this was not disputed by the Respondent. We also accept that not in accordance with the law can in principle include errors of law relating to procedural unfairness (as did Judge McKenna in Facebook, and Judge Markus QC in Our Vault Limited). However, we are mindful of Judge Wikeley’s warning in Central London that a pleaded case of procedural unfairness amounting to an error of law cannot be established by a critique of the twists and turns of the investigation; as Judge McKenna said in Facebook, it would require the Appellant to prove its case as to the most serious of allegations. 77. Taking that approach, we find we are not persuaded by the Appellants’ case as to procedural unfairness in these appeals. The Appellants’ witness evidence alleged actual bias by the Information Commissioner. This case was put on a somewhat diluted basis by the time of the hearing, as Ms Bilney’s oral evidence did not support the opinion given her witness statement. The pleaded case (in the amended grounds) was one of apparent bias. We have considered both allegations. 78. Firstly, we found no evidence which persuaded us on the balance of probabilities that there was actual bias in the making of these decisions. Ms Bilney’s oral evidence was that the investigation seemed unfair and it related to Brexit, but that statement is insufficient to prove a case of politically-motivated bias. We understand from the evidence that Leave.EU and Eldon came to the Information Commissioner’s attention as a result of the Cambridge Analytica furore, but that the investigation in due course revealed other concerns. We see no difficulty in principle with a regulator commencing an investigation in one context but pursuing other regulatory failings which come to their attention. As to the complaints about the exchange of emails between the Information Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner on 4 November 2018, we heard evidence about the ICO’s internal chain of command in Operation Cederberg and we accept Mr Eckersley’s evidence that he himself made the decisions to issue the Notices with which we are concerned. He was not party to the e mail exchange on the 4 November. He told us he was unaware of any plan to initiate a joint investigation with the FCA. We conclude that a case as to actual bias could only be established where the evidence showed that the person alleged to have been biased made or directly influenced the decision said to have been affected by that person’s bias. That has evidently not been established here. 79. The Appellants’ pleaded case alleged apparent bias on the basis that a fair- minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that bias had infected the investigation and the decisions to issue the Notices. We accept that certain decisions in the investigation could have been better documented, we understand the Appellants’ frustration at the publication of regulatory action against them at such an early stage and the impression given by their inclusion in the Operation Cederberg reporting, we also appreciate their concern at the mis- description of their case to the Parliamentary Committee when (as is accepted) the Deputy Commissioner mis-spoke. However, it seems to us that the informed observer would have in mind the context in which this investigation took place: the history of 27penalties for regulatory non-compliance within the group, the public statements made by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore, and a legitimate regulatory concern in relation to the transmission of 1,069,852 emails. In this context, we are not persuaded that the Appellants’ criticisms of the twists and turns of the ICO investigation are sufficient to establish a case of apparent bias. 80. The Appellants’ case as to procedural fairness also relied on an argument that the Appellants had not had the benefit of due process during the investigation. This was directed to Mr Facenna’s submission that the Tribunal ought not to proceed to make a fresh decision on the basis of the evidence before it if it allows the appeals. We note here that the Information Commissioner, in accordance with the statutory scheme, served Notices of Intent to make MPNs on Eldon and Leave.EU and that she served a Preliminary Enforcement Notice on Eldon. She considered the representations made in response to those Notices and, indeed, reduced the amount of the MPN for Leave.EU as a result of financial evidence provided. It does not seem that the Appellants’ case of failure to observe due process can be established in these circumstances. 81. The Assessment Notices are in a different category to the MPNs and Enforcement Notice, because they are an investigatory tool requiring no Notice of Intent to be served. There is no statutory threshold for serving an Assessment Notice and, we conclude, no obligation to explain to the person on whom they are served the nature of the Information Commissioner’s concerns which caused the decision to serve the Assessment Notice. This situation is far-removed from the Karagul scenario where a final decision had been made without putting regulatory concerns fairly to those affected so as to give them a chance to answer. We note that in UKIP, Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley at [31] describes a situation where the answers given in response to an Information Notice were late, brief, unsatisfactory, and inconsistent with publicly available information supplied by UKIP itself so as to give the Commissioner the impression that UKIP was not taking the Notice seriously. He described the Information Commissioner’s choice as to how to respond to that situation as a classic issue of discretion and we regard the decision to issue the Assessment Notices similarly. After a considerable period of investigation, the ICO continued to have concerns, justified in our view by the Appellants’ confusingly two- faced approach to regulation. Mr Banks’ letter to the Information Commissioner admitting that he had been untruthful in the past was hardy likely to assuage all regulatory concerns, especially as it was followed by his letter of bullying tone from which we quote at paragraph 11 above. Ms Bilney, whilst presenting herself as the face of compliance, had given responses to the Information Notices which had been inaccurate in important respects. There was continued confusion about the roles and responsibilities of entities within the corporate group, and Mr Eckersley’s evidence was that he thought that confusion might be being caused deliberately. These factors support, in our view, an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner to exercise an additional investigatory tool which Parliament has placed at her disposal. 82. We have acknowledged above some difficulties in the ICO’s internal procedures and we accept that the decision-making paper trail leading to the Assessment Notices is lacking. However, in the context of a discretionary decision to 28issue Assessment Notices, we do not find that these inadequacies are, to use the words of Lord Wilberforce, so flagrant, the consequences so severe, that the most perfect of appeals or re-hearings will not be sufficient to produce a just result. We conclude that any procedural irregularities can be cured in the context of this full merits appeal, and that, if we allowed any of these appeals, it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to make a fresh decision and issue a substituted Notice. 83. There was a dispute before us about the applicability of the Information Commissioner’s Regulatory Acton Policy29 in relation to these Notices. The RAP was finalised in November 2018 and is clearly concerned with the ICO’s new powers under the DPA 2018. However, it sets out principles of good practice which we would expect the ICO to follow in all cases. That said, the RAP is not a straight-jacket, it deals in high-level principles and cannot cater for all eventualities. If the ICO has exercised her discretion in these cases in a manner not envisaged by the RAP, that does not seem to us on its own to provide a basis for allowing the appeals. 84. We turn now to look at the Notices themselves. First, in relation to the MPNs, we note that the evidence before us includes the ICO’s internal decision-making documents (p.203 -233) in which the nature and seriousness of the breach is considered, and recommendations made as to the appropriate level of penalty with reference to other cases. There is before us now a better-articulated case as to the ICO’s analysis of the breaches which the MPNs are intended to penalise than is shown in those documents, but that is in the nature of a full merits appeal. 85. The key question in relation to the MPNs is whether the Information Commissioner was right in law to find that there had been a breach of PECR. Having considered the matter carefully, we conclude that the GoSkippy emails did contravene regulation 22 PECR for the following reasons. Firstly, we are satisfied that the content of the newsletters included material which constituted direct marketing material, by including the GoSkippy banner but also by associating Skippy the kangaroo with Mr Banks’ business interest in GoSkippy insurance and his political views. There would be no other reason to include a kangaroo in a political newsletter other than to reinforce the association with Eldon’s product. 86. Second, we agree with the Information commissioner that the GoSkippy e mails were unsolicited in the sense that they contained information which could not have been within the contemplation of subscribers who had signed up to receive a political newsletter. We agree with Mr Knight that the Appellants’ approach to the question of whether the information they received was solicited or unsolicited sought to introduce a primary purpose test for which there is no legal authority. We conclude that the Tribunal should be guided by the purpose of the E Privacy Directive which PECR implements, in preventing unwarranted intrusion into citizens’ privacy. It seems to us that inserting direct marketing material into a political newsletter does constitute such an intrusion. Although the complaints from subscribers were few in number, they seem to us accurately to describe the problem. We did not find it helpful to consider 29 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 29what other commentators have said about the E Privacy Directive in the reports to which we were referred. 87. Fourthly, we were not persuaded by the Appellants’ argument that the terms of the Privacy Notice or Privacy Policy permitted the sending of direct marketing material to subscribers. We found that there was potential for considerable confusion by subscribers in consulting policies which referred to a different legal entity from the one with which they were dealing. Even if one accepts (as did the Information Commissioner) that subscribers conducted themselves in relation to the policy they were presented with, we find that their consent to receive information that Leave.EU felt might interest them was so all-encompassing as to fail to meet the necessary standard of consent being freely-given, specific and informed. 88. The fifth issue to consider here is the question of instigation. We are satisfied from the evidence presented to us that Leave.EU transmitted the GoSkippy communications. We are also satisfied that Eldon instigated that transmission. We have had the benefit of seeing the emails exchanges referred to at paragraph 49 above, which had not been seen by the ICO when it made its decision on this point, in addition to hearing oral evidence from Ms Bilney. We note that there was a noticeable informality between the parties to the exchanges as to which company they represented at any one time and this confusion extended to Ms Bilney and Mr Banks’ roles. Nevertheless, it is clear from those e mails that “Arron” controlled the timing, content, naming, extent, and cessation of the Brexit discount message. He could only have done so in his role as the ultimate owner of Eldon/GoSkippy because Leave.EU would not have been able to make those decisions by itself. The reference to him “reviewing the [news]letter” suggests that he was also in control of the kangaroo- related content. Applying the test in Microsoft, this seems to us to go beyond mere facilitation and to represent a positive form of encouragement to transmit the offending material. 89. Having reached the conclusion that there had been a breach of PECR in the transmission and instigation of the transmission of the GoSkippy emails, we turn to consider s. 55A DPA 1998 and the Information Commissioner’s power to penalise such a breach. We concur with the Information Commissioner in concluding that there was not a deliberate breach of PECR by either Leave.EU or Eldon. However, we also agree with her that both companies knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that contravention would occur but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention. 90. We note here that the test is for the companies to know or that they ought to have known that there was a risk of contravention, not that they knew or ought to have known that there would be a contravention. This is an inevitably fact specific judgement. We consider a situation in which, on the one hand, a regulated business entity decides to engage in an unprecedented course of conduct by publicising its products via a political campaign newsletter. We also consider a situation in which those involved in that business entity have recent experience of being penalised for breach of PECR, and in which its policies, procedures and staff training have not previously considered PECR compliance because its usual business model did not 30contemplate its engagement. It seems to us that a prudent business entity, in embarking on the unprecedented course of conduct in these circumstances would have undertaken an appropriate due diligence exercise, especially in the context of recent regulatory contact with the ICO. That due diligence would have brought to its attention the clear guidance contained in the Information Commissioner’s publicly- available Direct Marketing Guidance. There was no evidence of such an exercise before us, indeed the evidence suggested ad hoc and off the cuff decision-making, controlled by Mr Banks personally. We conclude in these circumstances that Eldon should have known that its involvement in promoting the Brexit discount to Leave.EU subscribers would involve a risk of contravening PECR but that Eldon failed to take appropriate steps to prevent that contravention. 91. On the other side of the transaction we consider Leave.EU, which also had recent experience of problems with PECR and could have consulted the ICO guidance thereon. It decided to embark on a pilot scheme by which it might obtain funding for its political activities by promoting the GoSkippy discount, but it did so without the benefit of any legal agreement with Eldon (contrary to what it told its subscribers) and without first considering whether there was a risk of contravening PECR by its actions. It is unfortunate that, in these circumstances, Eldon apparently relied upon Leave.EU having the necessary consents in place. We conclude in these circumstances that Leave.EU should have known that its involvement in promoting the Brexit discount to Leave.EU subscribers would involve a risk of contravening PECR but that it failed to take appropriate steps to prevent that contravention. 92. We do not accept that Eldon or Leave.EU is entitled to say that the Information Commissioner has not taken any decisions which precisely relate to these circumstances so that their failure to appreciate or mitigate a risk can be excused. We assess the appropriate level of awareness and assessment of risk by the standard of the reasonable person and it does not seem reasonable to us that Ms Bilney had concluded that PECR was irrelevant to Eldon’s business model so she did not need to consider it. As we have noted above, the two companies decided to chart a novel course and it is to be expected that they would consider properly the implications of doing so. 93. Finally, on this point, we are satisfied that the contravention of Regulation 22 PECR was serious in view of the 1,069,852 million emails sent. We do not accept that a person who sends out mass communications in breach of PECR is entitled to say that the intrusion of privacy is mitigated by the number of people who did not open them or who deleted them without reading. It does not seem to us that the Information Commissioner made an error of law in concluding that the transmission of 1,069,852 GoSkippy emails represented a serious contravention of PECR so as to exercise her discretion in favour of serving an MPN. We are not persuaded by Mr Facenna’s submission that it was wrong for the ICO to serve MPNs on both Eldon and Leave.EU in relation to the same conduct. It seems to us that PECR attributes liability to those who transmit and to those who instigate the transmission of offending communications and that both are capable of attracting a penalty. 94. In relation to the amount of the MPNs, the starting point for each was £60,000 but Leave.EU’s penalty was reduced in consequence of its financial circumstances. 31We regard this as appropriate. We also note that both penalties were expressly said to have been set by the ICO in consideration of the mitigating factor of no complaints having been received from recipients of the communications. By the time of the hearing we knew this to be incorrect and it seems to us that we would be entitled to increase the level of penalty to correct this irregularity. However, having looked at the ICO’s documentation as to the consideration given to the level of penalty, we consider that there is no basis to interfere with it as we find that it is consistent with the ICO’s general approach and proportionate to the circumstances pertaining to this case. We discern no error of law in this respect. 95. Turning to the Enforcement Notice served on Eldon, we find no error of law in the ICO’s decision to make this decision. For the reasons we have outlined above, Eldon had decided that PECR was irrelevant to its operations despite developing new ways of working and having experience of previous breaches. The ICO found there to have been a contravention in circumstances where Eldon ought to have mitigated the risk of that eventuality, and so it seems to us that the ICO was justified in serving an Enforcement Notice to make clear that Eldon must consider PECR going forward. We are satisfied that this was a proportionate response to the on-going risk that Eldon would continue to believe that PECR was irrelevant to its operations. 96. We are satisfied, in all the circumstances of these appeals, that it was an appropriate exercise of the Information Commissioner’s discretion to serve Assessment Notices on Leave.EU and Eldon. As noted above, these are an investigatory tool which she is entitled to deploy without addressing a statutory threshold or informing the recipients of her concerns. That is not to say that Assessment notices can be issued on a capricious basis, but we find for all the reasons above that the Information Commissioner here had ample grounds for deciding that a more throughgoing investigation was required in the shape of an audit of both companies. We find that the differing scope of the proposed audits reflects the differing nature of the personal data held by each company and that the Notices are both in accordance with the law and appropriately-worded. 97.

The appeal is, by consent, allowed in part. The Tribunal makes a substituted Decision Notice by consent (see paragraph 17 below). 2. The remaining part of the appeal is dismissed. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant made a request to Plymouth Hospital NHS Hospitals Trust (now University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust) (“the Trust”) on 19 October 2017. Her request was subsequently refined to read as follows: “The request is for PHNT GUM YourSHIP department and service line local policies, procedures, practices, standards and guidelines, including: Clinical Safeguarding Operational Management, governance and administration Policy development, implementation, and governance Communications Clinical records management and information governance Appraisal and performance management”. 4. The Trust responded to the information request in reliance upon s. 21 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and said that the information requested was available on its website. It confirmed this position after an internal review on 29 January 2018. The Appellant complained to the Respondent. 5. The Respondent issued Decision Notice FS50712640 on 23 May 2018, upholding the Trust’s reliance on s. 21 FOIA. The Decision Notice found that the information requested was either available or that no further information within the scope of the request was held. It made procedural findings and recommendations but formally required no steps to be taken. 2Appeal to the Tribunal 6. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 2 June 2018 submits that the Trust’s website had broken hyper-links so that the requested information is not in fact available. She enclosed a screen shot dated the same day as the Decision notice was issued evidencing the broken links. She submitted that further information was held. She asked the Tribunal to uphold her complaints, direct that the information requested is provided to her, and additionally, for the Tribunal to direct the Information Commissioner’s Office to ensure that the Trust improves its information management practices and governance. 7. The Respondent’s Response dated 27 July 2018 (an extension of time having been granted) accepted that the Decision Notice was erroneous in concluding that the requested information was accessible when it was not in fact accessible. It is submitted that the broken links have subsequently been fixed. The Respondent maintains her conclusion that no more information is held. It is suggested that the Tribunal makes a substituted Decision Notice. 8. The Appellant’s Reply dated 3 August 2018 consents to the terms of the suggested substituted Decision Notice but asks for the matter to continue to determination by the Tribunal so that it may consider granting her the additional relief sought in the Notice of Appeal. It appears from the Reply that she no longer maintains that further information is held by the Trust. 9. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence, including submissions made by both parties, for which it was grateful. The Law 10. Section 1 FOIA provides a general right of access to information held by public authorities. However, that right is disapplied where the information requested falls within an exemption in part II of FOIA. 11. Section 10 FOIA provides the procedural framework for a public authority to respond to a request. 12. Section 21 FOIA provides that an absolute exemption applies to “information which is reasonably accessible to the applicant”. 13. The powers of the Tribunal in determining an appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Respondent are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 3the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” Conclusion 14. As noted above, the Respondent does not oppose this appeal to the extent that she accepts that, at the time the Decision Notice was issued, the requested information was not reasonably accessible because the links on the Trust’s website were broken. She has exhibited correspondence with the Trust showing that the links were mended on 26 June 2018. I am satisfied that the Decision Notice contained an error of law in concluding that s. 21 FOIA was engaged. I conclude that the appeal should be allowed in part on this basis. 15. I am unsure if the issue about further information being held is still being pursued as further information was provided. However, in order to ensure that all relevant issues are determined here, I have considered whether there is any evidence on which I might conclude on the balance of probabilities that more information is held. I am satisfied that there is not and so to the extent necessary I must formally dismiss the remainder of the appeal. 16. I understand that the Appellant wishes me to consider granting her the additional relief mentioned in her Notice of Appeal (see paragraph 6 above) but my powers are limited to those set out in s. 58 FOIA and so I am unable to make the directions sought. 17. I now allow the appeal in part and make the following substituted Decision Notice: The requested information was not reasonably accessible at the time of the request and so the public authority was not entitled to rely on s. 21 FOIA. As the requested information has subsequently become reasonably accessible, no steps are required to be taken. No further information within the scope of the request is held by the public authority. This decision was corrected under rule 41 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulation Chamber) Rules 2009 as amended, and reissued as dated below.

REASONS FOR DECISION 1. This appeal arises out of a Decision Notice of the Information Commissioner issued on 5 August 2015. It has been determined by a Judge sitting alone under a direction to that effect by the Chamber President. The determination has been made on the basis of written submissions and without a hearing because the Appellant opted for that means of determination and I consider it an appropriate method for dealing with the issues that arise under the Appeal. 2. The only issue under consideration in the Decision Notice was whether Sport England held any information at the time when the Appellant had submitted an information request to it (11 February 2015), which had not been disclosed in response to the request. The Information Commissioner decided that it had not. 3. The Decision Notice was issued after the Information Commissioner had completed an investigation into a complaint submitted to him by the Appellant. The complaint identified that the Appellant’s concern was that Sport England had provided him with some only of the information he had asked for. Specifically, it said that two emails had been withheld. 4. The Information Commissioner’s investigation was carried out under the powers given to him by section 50 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The relevant parts of that provision read as follows: “(1)Any person (in this section referred to as “the complainant”) may apply to the Commissioner for a decision whether, in any specified respect, a request for information made by the complainant to a public authority has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part I. (2)On receiving an application under this section, the Commissioner shall make a decision unless it appears to him— (a)that the complainant has not exhausted any complaints procedure which is provided by the publicauthority in conformity with the code of practice under section 45, (b)that there has been undue delay in making the application, (c)that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or (d)that the application has been withdrawn or abandoned. (3)Where the Commissioner has received an application under this section, he shall either— (a)notify the complainant that he has not made any decision under this section as a result of the application and of his grounds for not doing so, or (b)serve notice of his decision (in this Act referred to as a “decision notice”) on the complainant and the public authority. (4)Where the Commissioner decides that a public authority— (a)has failed to communicate information, or to provide confirmation or denial, in a case where it is required to do so by section 1(1), or (b)has failed to comply with any of the requirements of sections 11 and 17, the decision notice must specify the steps which must be taken by the authority for complying with that requirement and the period within which they must be taken. 5. The “specified respect” in which Sport England had allegedly failed to comply with the FOIA was recorded in paragraph 9 of the Decision Notice as “whether Sport England holds further information falling within the scope of the request”. 6. The Decision Notice also recorded (in paragraphs 16-29) how Sport England had responded to the information request and the searches it carried out. Those paragraphs also recorded the manner in which the Information Commissioner challenged Sport England when it became apparent that the Appellant had obtained, from another source, certain e-mails which fell within the scope of the information request but had not been disclosed to him. The explanation provided by Sport England is also recorded. 7. The Information Commissioner concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, Sport England did not hold any further relevant information. The rationale for that conclusion appears in paragraphs 30 -33 of the Decision Notice and does not merit being repeated here.8. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the Decision Notice on 1 September 2015. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, he ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 9. The Grounds of Appeal did not address the decision which the Information Commissioner had made. It stated, in plain terms: “The issue is therefore NOT whether Sport England still holds relevant material, but whether it had handled information correctly, and in line with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, by deleting a specific email exchange. The ICO decision does not address this issue at all.” 10. The Appellant then went on to explain that his criticisms were that: a. Sport England had not acted in accordance with the Code of Practice on the management of records established under FOIA section 46, in particular because it did not have a clearly established policy on the deletion of emails; b. Sport England had further breached the Code of Practice by deleting certain specific emails that should have been retained; and c. The Decision Notice “contradicts” FOIA section 47 because it represented a failure to promote good practice and observance of the requirements of FOIA. 11. On the basis of those criticisms the Appellant invited this Tribunal to a. require the Information Commissioner to serve an enforcement notice on Sport England to ensure it fully complies with the law; b. issue a recommendation that Sport England prepare, agree and follow a proper policy for the handling of information; and c. consider whether the deletion of the emails in question constituted a crime. 12. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction to either explore any of the criticisms made or take any of the steps requested. Its jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of the Decision Notice under appeal and that, in turn, is limited to the consideration of any failure by a public authority to comply with obligations imposed under Part 1 of FOIA. Sections 46 and 47 do not fall within that Part. It follows that any breach of a relevant Code of Conduct may not be investigated by either the Information Commissioner or this Tribunal on appeal. FOIA section 49 requires the Information Commissioner to report annually to Parliament and it is clearly for Parliament, and not this Tribunal, to express anyviews on the manner in which he may have exercised the functions imposed on him under section 47 or any other provision. 13. Although the Appellant has not therefore raised any issue which this Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider it is appropriate to add that I see no grounds to criticise the Decision Notice in respect of either the scope of the Information Commissioner’s investigation, the steps which it records him as having taken in the course of that investigation or the reasons given for reaching the decision that he did. 14. The Appeal is accordingly dismissed. ……….. Judge 2016"
"200","FOI","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) EA/2015/0154 CRUELTY FREE INTERNATIONAL Appellant And THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Hearing Held on 23 November 2015 at Field House Before Marion Saunders and Judge Claire Taylor. Date of Decision: 28 December 2015 Date of Promulgation: 29 December 2015 Decision The appeal is unanimously dismissed for the reasons set out below. There are no further steps to be taken by the Public Authority. 1Reasons Background 1 1. Cruelty Free International (CFI) campaigns against animal experiments. 2. The Home Office issues licences to universities and their staff in relation to procedures that are carried out on protected animals for scientific or educational purposes. Procedures that are regulated include administering anesthetics, humane killing of protected animals and removing organs and blood. 3. The licences are presently granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (‘ASPA’) as amended by the ASPA Amendment Regulations 2012 (ASPA Regulations)2. There is a three-level licensing system for the person, the project and the place: a. a ‘personal licence’ for those carrying out regulated procedures b. a ‘project licence’ to cover the regulated procedures to be carried out c. an ‘establishment licence’, specifiying where the work may be carried out. 4. An establishment licence holder (‘ELH’) is expected to have been or be trained in relevant ethical and legislative knowledge.3 5. ASPA was amended by the ASPA regulations. There are transitional provisions covering project licences that were in existence at the time the regulations came into force in 1 January 2013, such that CFI explains that the ELH’s duties are covered by separate rules relating to projects before and after that date. The Request 6. On 11 September 2014, the Appellant requested from the University of Bristol (‘the University’), as a ‘public authority’ for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (‘FOIA’ or the ‘Act’): “Would you please let us have, under section 1(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the following information pertaining to animal experiments under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 [ASPA] at your establishment: the number of animals used in scientific experiments in 2013, by (i) species, and (ii) purpose of research?” 7. On 2 October 2014, the University stated that it held the information but considered that compliance with the request would exceed the appropriate cost limit provided under s.12 FOIA such that it did not need to comply with the request. 1 Formerly British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection or BUAV. 2 SI 2012/3039 regs 1(2), 2 and 6. (The background in this decision relates to the rules in England, Scotland and Wales.) 3 Paragraphs 2 to 4 are derived from the Guidance on the operation of The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 produced by the Home Office in March 2014. 28. The Appellant progressed matters leading to an investigation by the Information Commissioner (the ‘Commissioner’). He decided that the University was not obliged to provide the Appellant with the requested information because it would exceed the appropriate cost limit.4 The reasoning in the Decision Notice included5: a. Cost Estimate: The way that the information was held meant that it would cost in excess of £450 to collate it, such that the University could properly rely on s.12 FOIA as a basis for refusal. This was because: i. No central record of the requested information was held such that it was not readily available. Therefore, the University would first need to contact each individual license holder and ask them to manually retrieve the relevant information from their licenses. ii. The University currently had approximately 60 license holders, and the figure would have been higher at the date of the request. The estimated 20 minutes for each license was a reasonable amount of time to check that the information was within the specified timeframe, to identify the number in species of animal and the purpose of the research. A previous Decision Notice6 had found 20 to 30 minutes for each license to be a reasonable estimate, but in that case it was necessary to extract more information than presently. iii. Multiplying 20 minutes by 60 licenses, it would take a minimum of 20 hours to locate, retrieve and extract the requested information. This was in excess of £450. b. Remit: The Commissioner could only make a decision on whether the University was correct to apply section 12 for the request, and not whether the information should already have been collated and readily available under different legislation. It was not within the Commissioner’s remit to assess the University’s compliance with ASPA. Regardless of obligations under ASPA, if as a matter of fact, it would cost the University in excess of £450 to comply with the request, then it could rely on section 12 FOIA. c. Requirements under ASPA: The University had explained that the ASPA did not require it to hold the requested information in any particular format or require the University to ensure that the requested information was readily accessible. The University had explained that there was no requirement in any guidance to have the information readily collated and available at all times. Having noted that the ASPA Regulations required that records be maintained in a format acceptable to the Secretary of State and asked the University about this, the Commissioner understood that in the event of a request from the Secretary of State, the University would need to collate the required information from its existing locations with licence holders. 9. The Appellant now appeals this decision. 4 Decision Notice Ref: FS50569289 5 For ease of reference we have added our own titles in bold print and arranged the arguments accordingly. 6 Decision Notice Ref. FS 50449254 3The Task of the Tribunal 10. Our task is to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or whether any discretion he exercised should have been exercised differently. The Tribunal is independent of the Commissioner, and considers afresh the Appellant’s complaint. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. In this case, our remit is limited to considering whether the University has correctly applied s12 FOIA in dealing with the Appellant’s request. 11. We received a Decision Notice, the Appellant’s grounds of appeal, response and skeleton argument, and the Commissioner’s responses and subsequent letter as well as a bundle of documents and authorities. We have reviewed all of these documents, even if not specifically referred to below. 12. The Appellant appeared before us at an oral hearing providing additional argument and a substantial file of authorities and other material relied upon which it was not possible to read during the hearing and therefore needed to be considered by the panel afterwards. The Commissioner did not attend the hearing. CFI made extensive arguments generally. We have aspired to capture the essence of these here, and gave in any event we have considered them all. The Law 13. A person making a request of a public authority for information is generally entitled to be informed in writing whether it holds the information requested, unless exemptions or exclusions set out in the FOIA apply. If it holds the information, the public authority is generally required to disclose it subject to exemptions. (See S.1(1)(a)and(b)FOIA). 14. Section 12 FOIA provides: ‘(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit. (2) Subsection (1) does not exempt the public authority from its obligation to comply with paragraph (a) of section 1(1) unless the estimated cost of complying with that paragraph alone would exceed the appropriate limit. (3) In subsections (1) and (2) “the appropriate limit is such amount as may be prescribed, and different amounts may be prescribed in relation to different cases. …(5) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the purposes of this section as to the costs to be estimated and as to the manner in which they are to be estimated.’ (Emphasis Added.) 15. Therefore, a public authority is not required to comply with a request for information under the FOIA if the authority estimates that the cost of complying would exceed the ‘appropriate limit’. 416. The “appropriate limit” is set by the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (‘FIDP’ or ‘the fee regulations’). Regulation 3 FIDP provides that for a public authority listed under Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Act (which includes government departments), the ‘appropriate limit’ is £450 for public authorities such as the University. This is regarded as 18 hours of the public authority’s time (See Regulation 4 FIDP). 17. In making its estimate, a public authority may only take account the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in - (a) determining whether it holds the information, (b) locating it, or a document which may contain the information, (c) retrieving it, or a document which may contain the information, and (d) extracting it from a document containing it. (See regulation 4(3) FIDP). 18. A public authority does not have to make a precise calculation of the costs of complying with a request. Instead, only an estimate is required. However, we accept the guidance in Randall v Information Commissioner EA/2007/0004 that it must be a reasonable estimate, which is ‘sensible, realistic, and supported by cogent evidence’. 19. A public authority does not have to rely on s.12 FOIA and may decide to comply with a request even if it estimates that the cost of doing so will exceed the appropriate limit. If it does rely on s.12 of FOIA, it is not required to make a precise calculation of the cost of complying. 20. Past decisions of this Tribunal have found that the estimate the authority is entitled to make is based on the factual estimate made by the authority in relation to the state of the records as they are and not as they should be. See for instance, in Ian Fitzsimmons v the ICO and DCMS (Appeal No.: EA/2007/0124), paragraph 60: “We have already raised our concerns over the lack of a proper system; however, as this is the system that operated at the relevant time, we do not consider that it could be unreasonable to work out the estimate on that basis.” 21. Section 13 enables a public authority to charge fees for supplying the requested information where section 12 applies: ‘(1) A public authority may charge for the communication of any information whose communication - (a) is not required by section 1(1) because the cost of complying with the request for information exceeds the amount which is the appropriate limit for the purposes of section 12(1) and (2), and (b) is not otherwise required by law, such fee as may be determined by the public authority in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State…’ The Issues 22. CFI has not sought to dispute the University’s estimate that it would cost the University in excess of £450 to comply with the request, or raise any arguments in relation to the public authority’s duty to comply and assist it under s16 FOIA and these matters are outside the scope of this appeal. 523. CFI’s main arguments centre on around three subjects that it describes as the substantive legal, factual, and jurisdictional issues: The substantive legal issue a. In relying on s12 FOIA, a public authority cannot bring into account time spent in locating, retrieving and collating information to the extent that it should already have collated under a pre-existing legal obligation such as that under ASPA and the amendment regulations. b. It asserted that the proper interpretation of s.12(1) is that it only applies where the steps needed to comply with s1(1)(b)FOIA (here, collation in order to disclose) properly arise for the first time because of the request. Similarly, a public authority does not ‘reasonably’ expect to incur costs in (inter alia) locating and retrieving information within regulation 4(3) of the fees regulation where it is in breach of a separate, pre-existing legal duty to locate and retrieve the information. An authority would otherwise benefit from its own breach of the pre-existing legal duty, in this case under ASPA and the amendment regulations. The jurisdictional issue c. The Commissioner erred by holding that it is not within his remit to assess whether the University was in compliance with ASPA. The factual issue d. The University should already have collated the information requested under a pre-existing legal obligation, under ASPA or the amended ASPA. Accordingly, the Commissioner erred by holding that there was no obligation on the University to have collated the requested information. The substantive legal issue 24. The Appellant’s evidence and arguments include the following: Witness statement a. Dr Katy Taylor testified that: i. There is culture of secrecy around animal experiments in this country, including at universities, and the Home Office. ii. The request was identical to that made of all universities in the UK, and the University is the only one, out of two originally, which still relies on s.12 FOIA. Submissions a. CFI maintained in submissions that the University should have already collated the information under its duties under ASPA, such that it could not take advantage of a breach of those duties. Were it to be able to do so, it would, be placed in an unfair and advantageous position over universities which have complied with their ASPA duties and disclosed the requested information. It would also give the green light to other universities that they could take advantage of a failure to comply with their ASPA duties. A 6public authority could not invoke the protection afforded by section 12 and the fee regulations in relation to a request that was too expensive to fulfil by its own fault. b. The principles of statutory interpretation were fluid and overlapped such regardless of the mode of interpretation, it was important to arrive at the correct interpretation. (In R (Noone) v Governor of HMP Drake Hall,7 Lord Saville, said: ‘I have no doubt that by one route or another the legislation must be construed so as to avoid what would otherwise produce irrational and indefensible results that Parliament could not have intended.’) c. A Purposive Construction of section 12: i. Legislation had to be interpreted in the context of what it is seeking to achieve. As a result, it may be necessary to prefer what is known as a ‘strained’ construction over the literal or grammatical meaning. It may also be necessary to imply words into legislation, for example to avoid the absurdity which would otherwise result. Lord Steyn stated in A-G’s Reference (No 5 of 2002): 8 ‘It is true, as Lord Bingham has pointed out, that the inclusion in section 17(2) of an offence under section 1(2) of the [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000] creates a linguistic difficulty given the language in which section 17(1) is expressed. In my view, however, this point is decisively outweighed by a purposive interpretation of the statute. No explanation for resorting to purposive interpretation of a statute is necessary. One can confidently assume that Parliament intends its legislation to be interpreted not in the way of a black letter lawyer, but in a meaningful and purposive way giving effect to the basic objectives of the legislation’. (Emphasis Added). The purpose of the FOIA ii. The purpose of the FOIA is to create a right for members of the public to receive information held by public authorities, subject to a number of exemptions. The current Call for Evidence by the Independent Commission on Freedom of Information9 summarised in its Introduction the objectives of FOIA: ‘... The Act’s intended objectives, on parliamentary introduction, were to: “transform the culture of Government from one of secrecy to one of openness”; “raise confidence in the processes of government, and enhance the quality of decision making by Government”; and to “secure a balance between the right to information…and the need for any organisation, including Government, to be able to formulate its collective policies in private”. 7 [2010] UKSC 30 8 [2004] UKHL 40, [2004] 2 All ER 901 at [31] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/40.html 9 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/472007/ICFOI_call_for_ evidence_paper_web281015.pdf (9 October 2015) 7iii. FOIA enables informed debate which in turn leads to better decision-making. The right is not unqualified: it may have to give way to other interests in the carefully calibrated circumstances set out in the various exemptions, including section 12. A balance has to be struck. In Kennedy v Charity Commission 10 Lord Sumption, with whom Lord Neuberger and Lord Clarke agreed, said: 11 ‘The Freedom of Information Act 2000 was a landmark enactment of great constitutional significance for the United Kingdom. It introduced a new regime governing the disclosure of information held by public authorities. It created a prima facie right to the disclosure of all such information, save in so far as that right was qualified by the terms of the Act or the information in question was exempt. The qualifications and exemptions embody a careful balance between the public interest considerations militating for and against disclosure. The Act contains an administrative framework for striking that balance in cases where it is not determined by the Act itself. The whole scheme operates under judicial supervision, through a system of statutory appeals’. The purpose of section 12 iv. The purpose of section 12 is to balance the public’s right to information and the interests of public authorities not to have their resources diverted to an unreasonable extent from their other duties, on the other. Public authorities should not have to spend more than a certain amount of time dealing with a request. However, the fees regulations only permit certain types of activity to be brought into account. The permissible time is limited to physical tasks, such as locating and retrieving the information and not ‘thinking time’. Parliament has struck this particular balance in a restrictive way as far as public authorities are concerned and not all the time which it is anticipated will actually be spent dealing with a request can be brought into account. v. It is inconceivable, that Parliament should have intended that the section 12 balance could permit a public authority to bring into account the time needed to comply with an entirely separate legal obligation. It would not have had to spend the time if it had met a pre-existing legal obligation. d. Construing the Natural meaning of section 12 vi. The natural or literal meaning of section 12, viewed in context, is that a public authority can only bring into account the time properly attributable to dealing with the request, and not also to time spent in complying with a separate legal obligation with which the public authority should previously have complied. vii. Section 12(1) refers to ‘the cost of complying with the request’. This is only to costs properly attributable to dealing with the request. In effect, the Commissioner wants to read words into the provision: 10 [2014] 2 WLR 808 11 At [153] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/20.html 8‘the cost of complying with the request plus if necessary the cost of complying with a pre-existing legal obligation’. There is no warrant for any such reading in. That would be to reward a public authority which was in breach of a pre-existing legal obligation and would be contrary to the purpose of FOIA. viii. The correct position is that, in computing time, one has to assume that the public authority has complied with pre-existing legal obligations with regard to the manner in which it holds requested information and the collation of the requested information as a record. The time needed to comply with pre-existing ASPA duties has no relevance to FOIA and must be left out of account. ix. The Commissioner relies on Robin Williams v Information Commissioner and Cardiff & Vale NHS Trust12 that ‘it is not open to the Tribunal to disallow reliance upon section 12 on the basis that the [public authority] could have organised its records more effectively’. There was no suggestion in the Robin Williams case that the public authority was in breach of a separate statutory obligation and it has no relevance. CFI does not argue that the University should have organised its records more effectively but rather that it should have complied with its duties under ASPA to compile a record and that, had it done so, it would not need to spend any time in collating it for the purposes of dealing with the FOIA request. e. Strained or purposive construction to be preferred to a literal construction: x. If it is found that CFI’s construction of section 12(1) is not the natural meaning of the section, CFI’s construction is at least semantically possible, such that the Tribunal should resolve the ambiguity by choosing that construction that accords with the statutory purpose. This accords with the principles set out in ‘Bennion on Statutory Interpretation’ (6th edition, 2013) (‘Bennion’) which explains that a strained construction may be appropriate where the consequences of a literal construction are so undesirable that Parliament cannot have intended them. (See Section 158 of Bennion). f. Reading words into section 12(1): xi. If, contrary to CFI’s submission, its construction is neither appropriate as representing the natural meaning of section 12(1) nor as a strained construction, it is necessary to read into it words to the effect ‘(but not the cost of complying with a separate legal obligation)’ after ‘cost of complying with the request’. This accords with Bennion’s circumstances in which words may be implied into legislation. (See Sections 172-179 of Bennion). ‘The legislator is presumed to intend that the literal meaning of the express words of an enactment is to be treated as elaborated by 12 EA/2008/0042 at paragraph 28 9taking into account all implications which, in accordance with the recognised guides to legislative intention, it is proper to treat the legislator as having intended’. (Section 172) xii. An Ellipsis or device of leaving unsaid some portion of what the writer means, or must be taken to mean is according to Bennion, ‘necessarily used to a large extent in the drafting of Acts of Parliament’. So the fact that Parliament could have added the suggested words is not a reliable test. It is not obligatory that the implication is necessary or obvious; what matters is whether it is proper or legitimate in order to arrive at the legal meaning i.e. that intended by Parliament. (See Section 174 of Bennion). xiii. Reading in words is particularly legitimate where a literal construction would lead to an absurdity.13 Bennion explains: ‘The court seeks to avoid a construction that produces an absurd result, since this is unlikely to have been intended by Parliament. Here the courts give a very wide meaning to the concept of “absurdity”, using it to include virtually any result which is unworkable or impracticable, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical, futile or pointless, artificial, or productive of a disproportionate counter-mischief’14 (Section 312(1) of Bennion) xiv. Here, the absurdity of the construction for which the Commissioner contends is in particularly plain sight when section 13 FOIA, and regulation 7 of the fees regulations, are considered. If it were correct that a public authority could properly bring into account the costs of complying with a pre-existing legal obligation, it could literally profit from its default by charging a fee. In the present context, the University would thereby be recovering from CFI the cost of putting right its failure to collate the information as a record for ASPA. That would represent a clear abuse of power, susceptible to judicial review, which simply underlines why a public authority cannot bring into account the cost of putting right its failure to honour a pre-existing legal obligation. g. The meaning of regulation 4(3) of the fees regulations xv. Regulation 4(3) states: ‘In a case in which this regulation has effect, a public authority may, for the purpose of its estimate, take account only of the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in …’ (emphasis added). This means that a public authority cannot bring into account the costs it actually expects to incur in collating the requested information, but only the costs it reasonably expects to incur. The question is what costs would be reasonably incurred. It would not be reasonable to allow a public authority to bring into account the costs of meeting a separate, pre- existing legal obligation, for the reasons already discussed. Moreover, the costs which the University wishes to bring into 13 The avoidance of absurdity may also require a strained rather than a literal construction 14 See Lord Millett in R(Edison First Power Ltd) v central Valuation Officer [2003] UKHL 20, [2003] 4 All ER 209 at [116], [117] 10account are not simply those ‘in relation to the request’ but also those in relation to complying with its duties under ASPA. xvi. The true cost faced by the University in complying with CFI’s request is nil, or close to nil. When it received the request, the University had failed to compile a record containing the information in question, as required by ASPA. It was under a continuing duty to do so. It is not ‘reasonable’, within regulation 4(3), to seek to pass on the costs of putting its house in ASPA order to CFI; moreover, those costs do not ‘relate to’ the CFI request. xvii. This is the natural or literal meaning of regulation 4(3). If this is wrong, there is an ambiguity and CFI’s construction is, to put it at its lowest, possible as a strained construction and should be preferred to the literal construction adopted by the Commissioner, for the policy reasons already discussed. If a strained construction is not possible, it is appropriate to imply words such as ‘(but not in complying with a pre-existing legal obligation)’ after ‘in relation to the request’. 25. The Commissioner’s arguments on this point have included the following: a. The relevant question is regardless of any legal obligation to hold the requested information in a specified manner, given the manner in which the information was in fact held at the time of the request, how long it would take the University to comply with the request. b. That in Urmenyi v Information Commissioner and London Borough of Sutton (EA/2006/0093), the Information Tribunal stated: ‘It is clear from the wording of section 12 that it is for the [public authority] to estimate whether the appropriate limit would be exceeded. The estimation is for the public authority to take based on the estimates of the times for the individual activities allowed to be included by the Regulation 4. The Commissioner and the Tribunal can enquire into whether the facts or assumptions underlying this estimation exist and have been taken into account by the public authority. The Commissioner and Tribunal can also enquire about whether the estimation has been made upon other facts or assumptions which ought not to have been taken into account. Furthermore, the public authority’s expectation of the time it would take to carry out the activities set out in Regulation 4(3) a-d must be reasonable.’ Emphasis Added c. Reference to the Upper Tribunal in Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis v Information Commissioner & Donnie Mackenzie [2014] UKUT 0479 (AAC). At paragraph 42, this stated: ‘42. The moral of this case is perhaps this. The question of whether a request falls foul of the cost limit in section 12 is likely to be a function of two factors. The first is the breadth of the request itself, a matter over which the requestor has a considerable degree of control. 11By definition a carefully focussed FOIA request is less likely to be caught by the cost limit. The second factor concerns the record- keeping practices of the public authority, a matter over which the individual requestor obviously has no control. It may be more difficult to avoid the impact of the section 12 cap when making a request to a relatively decentralised public authority. However, the fact is that FOIA is about the citizen’s right to information, subject to certain safeguards, checks and balances. It is not a statute that prescribes any particular organisational structure or record-keeping practice in public authorities.’ (Emphasis added.) d. The Commissioner does not argue for words to be read into section 12 as the Appellant asserts and rejects that Parliament intended section 12 to be interpreted as the Appellant submits. The Commissioner accepts that it will take a public authority longer to find the requested information where the relevant records are poorly organised or filed. This may mean that the public authority needs to address any records management issues in accordance with guidance issued under s.46 FOIA but it is not a reason to prevent a public authority from relying on s.12 FOIA. Section 12 is silent on the manner in which a public authority holds information. The focus when applying it is on how a public authority’s records are held at the time an information request is received, rather than how they should be held under separate legislation. e. The Information Tribunal has confirmed (in the case of Robin Williams v Information Commissioner and Cardiff & Vale NHS Trust at paragraph 28 that it is ‘not open to the Tribunal to disallow reliance upon section 12 on the basis that the [public authority] could have organised its records more effectively’; the relevant question is whether information is held at the time of the request and, if so, how long it would take to comply with the request. Our Findings on the substantive legal issue 26. In brief, we accept all points made by the Commissioner set out at paragraphs 25 above. 27. Looking at section 12, CFI seeks to argue that the public authority may not rely on section 12 and the fee regulations because it is their own fault that the cost of complying with the request exceeds the limit set by the regulations. When looking at the plain or natural meaning of s.12(1)FOIA, CFI asserts that ‘the cost of complying with the request’ means the costs properly attributable to dealing with the request and not ‘the cost of complying with the request plus if necessary the cost of complying with a pre-existing legal obligation’. 28. However, it seems clear to us when construing section 12 that the cost properly attributable to dealing with the request are those costs that it would take the University to comply with the request, and not, as the Appellant infers, ‘the cost of complying with the request minus any necessary cost of complying with a pre- existing legal obligation’. We see no authority for subtracting costs in this way based on the plain or literal or grammatical meaning of the legislation or fee regulation which makes no reference to discounting such costs. The Appellant is instead seeking to read words into the text. 1229. The Appellant asserts that the records are poor and breach pre-existing legislation. However, it seems clear that the cost estimate under FIDP is based on (a) the records system operating at the relevant time; and (b) the costs attributable to complying with the request. On the facts, there is no suggestion that the University factored into their estimate costs they intended to incur for some purpose in addition to complying with the request. This seems self-evident since in reality the University was not seeking to expend costs to comply with ASPA or at all, but rather to provide an estimate to ascertain whether it needs to spend the time to comply with FOIA, and it has asserted that it does not. 30. We have been referred to the Robin Williams case that states ‘it is not open to the Tribunal to disallow reliance upon section 12 on the basis that the [public authority] could have organised its records more effectively’15, and other Tribunals have made similarly findings. In Metropolis v Information Commissioner & Donnie Mackenzie [2014] UKUT 0479 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal have recognised that the recordkeeping practices of the public authority are something the requestor obviously has no control over such that it may be more difficult to avoid the impact of the section 12 cap when making a request to a relatively de- centralised public authority. Nevertheless, it made clear that ‘statute does not prescribes any particular organisational structure or record-keeping practice in public authorities.’ 31. Whilst the cases indicate that the integrity of section 12 is maintained regardless of poor recordkeeping practices, the Appellant asserted at the oral hearing that there is a distinction between poor records and a breach of separate statutory obligations. We do not think this is necessarily so. It is known that poor recordkeeping in itself creates a risk of non-compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements. In James v The Information Commissioner and DTI et al, (EA/2006/003), the Tribunal found section 12 to have been properly invoked, but questioned whether the public authority had complied with the Lord Chancellor’s Code of Practice on the management of records under section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Page 5 of that code states: “(viii) Authorities should note that if they fail to comply with the Code, they may also fail to comply with legislation relating to the creation, management, disposal, use and re-use of records and information, for example the Public Records Act 1958, the Data Protection Act 1998, and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005, and they may consequently be in breach of their statutory obligations.“ 32. In short, we are also not persuaded that section 12 and FIDP can be disregarded or words read into these where there is a breach of legislation. 33. The Appellant seeks to argue, that it is legitimate to read words into the legislation in this instance, where, (quoting Bennion), a literal construction would lead to an absurdity. Here, he contends the absurdity would be that s.13 FOIA, and regulation 7 of the fees regulations, would otherwise allow a public authority to bring into account the costs of complying with a pre-existing legal obligation, such that it could profit from its default by charging a fee. We do not accept this. First, the scenario is not relevant to this case because the University was not offering to provide the information on the basis of charging for it. Second, the requester is 15 EA/2008/0042 at paragraph 28 13not required to make a payment - it is their choice. It does not seem unreasonable to allow for a bargain to be made whereby an authority offers to provide information at the cost estimated for complying with a request, if this helps the requestor. The concern about poor records or poor compliance is separate and the two parties must operate within the reality of the situation. 34. Looking at the fee regulations, the Appellant asserts that regulation 4(3) FIDP means that a public authority cannot bring into account the costs it actually expects to incur in collating the requested information, but only the costs it reasonably expects to incur. CFI maintains that it would not be reasonable to allow a public authority to bring into account the costs of meeting a separate pre- existing legal obligation. We do not agree. Regulation 4(3) FIDP provides that ‘In a case in which this regulation has effect, a public authority may, for the purpose of its estimate, take account only of the costs it reasonably expects to incur in relation to the request in …’ We consider that reasonable in this context relates to the factual expectation as to what the amount of time the process of determining, locating retrieving and extracting is likely to take, in other words, whether it is a sensible estimate.16 35. Had the legislature wished us to consider in construing ‘reasonably’ the normative issues as to what ‘ought’ to be included in costs, it would have made section 12 what is known as a qualified exemption for the purposes of the Act. Instead, section 12 is not classified as an exemption, such that there is also no need to measure the weight of public interest in relying on the section. Instead, it operates as a guillotine applying for all requests before we even consider exemptions and matters of public interest.17 36. Looking at the purposive construction of the Act, the Appellant provides various purposes for the FOIA, all of which we accept. CFI then seeks to argue that not construing section 12 and the regulation in the way suggested would be contrary to the purpose of FOIA. We do not agree. The Act enables informed debate and benefits transparency, but does so through a framework that reflects the tension of balancing competing objectives and interests. It is within that context that the legislature has placed section 12 as an initial guillotine, valuing in all cases the need for the burden on authorities not to be excessive.18 37. The Appellant notes that not all anticipated time will be brought into account, including ‘thinking time’, and that it is inconceivable that it would have intended that the section to include time needed to comply with an entirely separate legal obligation. Since the FIDP sets out and limits the list of factors that can be taken into account in computing the estimate, we think it clear that those drafting the FIDP considered carefully and intended not to include what has been omitted. It is 16 In any event, we note that on the facts as already stated, the University is not bringing into account costs of meeting a separate legal obligation. There is no indication of an expectation to incur costs to comply with ASPA within the estimate, the only reason that the University would have incurred costs would have been to comply with the request. We also note that CFI has not sought to suggest that ‘reasonable’ here relates to a standard used for judicial review of ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’, and we do not think that it does. Wednesbury unreasonableness has its own particular meaning, which is distinct from that of ‘reasonably’ in this context. 17 See Quinn v The Information Commissioner and The Home Office EA/2006/0010. 18 We note that there is nothing in the Act requiring the public authority to rely on section 12, such that its decision may be susceptible to judicial review by the High Court in appropriate circumstances. 14also feasible to speculate good reasons for excluding ‘thinking time’, or making allowances in the way the Appellant argues for statutory breaches the FOIA and section12 are not intended to be interpreted in a punitive way if an authority has not complied with some separate legislation. 38. The Appellant maintains that a public authority should not be rewarded or in a better position than those who have complied with statutory obligations, and if they were this would give others the green light for similar behavior. We do not see a ‘normative’ reading of the regulations to be the correct construction of regulation 4(3) FIDP and it instead addresses the factual estimate of the expected costs based on the system that operated at the time of the request. 39. To conclude, regardless of the mode of interpretation, we do not accept that any ‘correct interpretation’ allows for what the Appellant maintains. The jurisdictional issue 40. The Appellant asserts that the Commissioner erred by holding that it is not within his remit to assess whether the University was in compliance with ASPA. CFI argues that there are occasions where the remit will include determining whether an authority has complied with separate legislation. (See s.44(1)(a) FOIA- information prohibited by or under any enactment). If correct on the substantive issue, then the Respondent was also obliged to consider whether the University should already have collated the requested information under ASPA. 41. The Respondent maintained that he considered it a relevant factual issue whether the University had been obliged to collate and hold the requested information. He did not reach an authoritative decision on those obligations. Section 12 did not require an authoritative determination on the University’s obligations under ASPA. Our Findings on the jurisdictional issue 42. We do not accept the Appellant was correct on the substantive issue. In relation to ascertaining whether an estimate is reasonable, it seems to us that it may be part of the Commissioner’s role in relevant cases to determine for itself whether there is legislation that the public authority needs to comply with where this may suggest that the authority is likely to be holding records in a manner different to that it claims such that it might not take as long to comply with the request. However, the Appellant did not seek to question whether the actual estimate was sensible or reasonable in this case, and this ground of appeal fails. The factual issue 43. Finally, the Appellant argues that the University should already have collated the information requested under a pre-existing legal obligation, under ASPA or the amended ASPA. Accordingly, the Commissioner erred by holding that there was no obligation on the University to have collated the requested information. This argument is only relevant for our purposes if we accept the Appellant’s substantive issue, which we have not. 44. In brief, the Appellant’s arguments include the following: a. The witness statement stating: 15i. There is a tripartite system of licensing under ASPA which must be in place before animal experiments can take place. This includes the ELH who is in overall charge of animal experiments at the establishment. Paragraph 3.1.3.2 of guidance issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department under section 21 ASPA 19 says that the ELH ‘…should be representative of the governing authority of the establishment..’. The ELH acts on behalf of the establishment. It appears that the University’s is the Deputy Vice-Chancellor. ii. The ELH has a duty under ASPA, under both the transitional provisions and the new rules, to hold a record of (inter alia) the number of animals and species used in experiments and the projects for which they are used. That corresponds to the information we have sought of the University. iii. An ELH has to hold the requested information because: ‘This accords with common sense. It would be extraordinary if a public authority such as the university did not know the number and purpose of animal experiments conducted on its premises. Apart from anything else, how can the ELH comply with his duty, under both ASPA and the transitional provisions, to ensure that there are sufficient trained staff and suitable installations and equipment if he does not know the number and species of the animals or the purpose for which they are used?’ iv. Paragraph 8 of part 2 of schedule 3 to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 (‘the amendment regulations’) in respect of project licences authorising procedures on animals granted prior to 1 January 2013; and paragraph 8(a) of schedule 2C to Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) (as amended on 1 January 2013 to transpose Directive 2010/63/EU) – in respect of project licences granted from 1 January 2013 onwards both require an ELH, to maintain a record of (inter alia) the number and species of animals used in procedures and the projects in which they are used. That necessarily obliges an ELH first to have compiled the information. The obligation does not, as the Respondent held in paragraph 32, only arise in the event of a request by the Secretary of State of the ELH for the information. b. Submissions that under ASPA, an ELH, representing the establishment, is under a duty to hold certain information (including that covered by the request) in a record. A record cannot be kept in 60 or more places (the number of project licences the University says are held by its employees). The ELH needs ready access to the information so that (i) he can comply with other duties under ASPA (including ensuring the appropriate housing and care of animals at the establishment) and (ii) provide it on demand to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. 19 Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (March 2014): https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/operation-of-aspa 16Our Findings on the factual issue 45. We are not persuaded here that there has been actual non-compliance with a statutory or regulatory obligation by the University in this case. The ELH is under a duty to hold certain information in a record. We do not accept that a record cannot be held if maintained in separate locations and there is nothing that we have been shown that suggests that the records must be held centrally or just in one place (though presumably it may be better to do so.) The meaning of record in the Oxford English Dictionary supports this, defining record as ‘set down in writing or some other permanent form for later reference’. 46. Further, given that the ELH is required to be someone extremely senior within the organisation, we consider it highly unlikely that it is expected that he or she will personally maintain the records. It is more likely that he or she is to be accountable or responsible to ensure that it is done. Accordingly, provided the appropriate records are held, it would seem these can be delegated to more than one individual. 47. To conclude, the appeal is unanimously dismissed. Other 48.

"142","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights On appeal from the Information Commissioner’s decision notice FS50619296 of 13 July 2016 Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0178 Heard at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre On 27 January 2017 Promulgation Date 27th February 2017 Before CHRIS HUGHES GARETH JONES DAVE SIVERS Between JOHN BRIDLE Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL Second RespondentDECISION AND REASONS 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is an adviser to defendants in litigation relating to asbestos. He made a complaint to the Second Respondent, the General Medical Council (the “GMC”) about a doctor. He subsequently sought information from the GMC about the way the complaint was handled. On 24 December 2015, he wrote to the GMC and requested information in the following terms: “May we know who your Assistant Registrar consulted as an asbestos expert able to understand the seriousness of the actions of [Dr A].’ ‘May we have some information as to their asbestos qualifications?” 2. There was some contact between the parties’ out with the statutory framework of the Data Protection Act (DPA) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the GMC responded to the Appellant formally relying on s40 of FOIA which deals with personal information. S40 provides (so far as is relevant):- “Personal information. (1)Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2)Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case…..(4) The second condition….). (5)The duty to confirm or deny— (a)does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b)does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 or would do so if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of that Act were disregarded, or (ii)…. (6)…. (7)In this section— “the data protection principles” means the principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1 to the M7Data Protection Act 1998, as read subject to Part II of that Schedule and section 27(1) of that Act; “data subject” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act; “personal data” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act. 3. Relying on these provisions the GMC informed the Appellant that it would neither confirm nor deny that it held the information. This was in accordance with their standard procedure published as the General Medical Council – Publication and Disclosure Policy (bundle page 180-189) which is not to disclose the identity of doctors against whom a complaint is made unless formal regulatory action is taken such as a warning or referral for a disciplinary hearing by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. Confirming under FOIA that such information existed would unfairly breach the data protection principles and cause distress to Dr A since it would have the effect of disclosing to the world that a complaint had been made against him. 4. The Appellant complained to the First Respondent, the ICO who after investigation upheld the approach of the GMC; explaining that the right of access to information placed two distinct duties on public authorities, to inform an applicant whether or not requested information was held and secondly to communicate that information. However FOIA provided that s40(5)(b)(i) allowed the public authority to neither confirm nor deny that information was held if to confirm whether or not it held information would reveal personal data of a third party in breach of a data protection principle. Revealing the information would disclose personal information about Dr A. Revealing the information would not be processing fairly and lawfully (first data protection principle) since Dr A had a reasonable expectation that theirpersonal data would not be revealed. Revealing the information would have some impact on Dr A and be unfair. The ICO then balanced Dr A’s rights against the legitimate interest in confirming or denying that the information was held and concluded that while the information requested was of interest to the Appellant it did not outweigh Dr A’s right to privacy. 5. The Appellant was dissatisfied with this and appealed; repeating in summary form matters he had put to the GMC in his complaint and arguing that the GMC should have come to a different conclusion “we suspect he [the expert] must be a colleague of Dr A’s and also involved…” . 6. The ICO resisted the appeal relying on the decision notice and noting that there was no basis for the Appellant’s claim of impropriety and therefore this claim had no impact on the balance of public interest. The GMC supported the reasoning of the ICO setting out the case law stressing the fundamental rights protected by the DPA. The GMC noted the absence of substantive grounds of appeal and reaffirmed that disclosure would reveal personal information about a living person, be in breach of Dr A’s reasonable expectation and causing distress and so be unfair, there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and further arguing that there was no need to apply a public interest balancing test. 7. In his skeleton argument the Appellant made clear that his concern about Dr A arose from litigation where Dr A’s evidence had been preferred to evidence put forward by his associates. In the light of these litigation failures he had complained to the GMC challenging Dr A’s conduct. He argued that the GMC had handled the complaint incorrectly and disclosure of the information sought would help him and his associates understand how the GMC had made its error. In his oral argument he maintained his approach of misconduct by the GMC, the individual whose details he sought was “not impartial”. He emphasised that he wanted to use this information so he could force Dr A to have a meeting and discuss issues with him. 8. Counsel for the GMC relied on the arguments put forward by the ICO and GMC. She drew attention to the careful explanation given to the Appellant of the reasoning behind the GMC’s handling of his complaint (bundle page 103) and to the precedents of the High Court and Upper Tribunal (Corporate Officer of the House of Commons and Goldsmith) setting out when the legitimate interests of a third party could over-ride the privacy interest of a data subject. There was no pressing social need established by the Appellant. Consideration 9. In this case the appellant has in essence sought to re-argue cases which have been lost in the civil courts (which could have been subject to appeal) and to challenge the decision-making of the GMC (which may be done by judicial review). He has argued misconduct by the GMC or its staff but has notproduced a scintilla of evidence for it – save that it has come to a conclusion with which he disagrees. He has not disputed that the information is personal data nor has he addressed the fairness of the disclosure - his argument is focussed on the balance of public interest which he perceives. However the disclosure which he seeks does not assist in his public interest argument which relates to the civil litigation his associates are concerned with, nor does it help with his declared desire to have a meeting and discussion with Dr A; since he already knows who Dr A is. The tribunal is satisfied that the reasoning of the ICO in his decision notice is correct in law and dismisses this appeal. 10. Our decision is unanimous.

Action Required: The Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary shall comply with s1(1)(a) FOIA in relation to the first limb of the information request within 35 days from today. Signed Fiona Henderson (Judge) Dated this 13th day of December 2011 3EA/2011/0114 REASONS FOR THE DECISION Introduction 1. The Professional Standards Department (PSD) of Hampshire Constabulary is responsible for investigating suspected misconduct in relation to its Police Staff and Officers. Executive Authority is an investigative tool whereby permission is granted by a Chief Officer1 for covert surveillance function2 to be introduced in cases of serious misconduct where the criminal threshold for directed surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) is not met. It is not provided for by way of a statute and unlike RIPA there is no statutory oversight. 2. Where during the course of an investigation authorised under Executive Authority procedure, criminal conduct by the subject(s) is identified, the Executive Authority must be immediately cancelled and an appropriate RIPA authorisation obtained. The availability of Executive Authority as an option for the PSD is outlined in the force’s procedure “Executive Authority concerning staff Issues”. This is available to all staff on the intranet. The Appellant considers that knowing that this investigative tool can be used is a significant deterrent to wrong doing amongst its employees. It is accepted by the Appellant that this is an intrusive tool. However, they argue that it can only be used in extreme cases where a subject is suspected of inappropriate activities. The Appellant’s Policy and Procedure for use of Executive Authority (paragraph 14) states that Executive Authority: “..applies to covert techniques conducted during the investigation of serious misconduct by police officers, and in circumstances outside of the workplace where such misconduct relates to a breach of Police Regulations 2003 (for example, restrictions on private life, incompatible business interest), or in relation to abuse of the Pension Regulations and attendance management procedures.” 1 The head of PSD or Assistant Chief Constable TO or SO 2 This includes the use of directed surveillance and/or deployment of a covert human intelligence source but will not be granted in relation to any activity taking place on residential premises or in a private vehicle other than the extent to which persons outside the curtilage of residential premises, or outside of a private vehicle would ordinary be able to view. 4EA/2011/0114 Request for Information 3. The Independent Police Support Group (IPSG) requested the following information (in the two limbs clearly specified) from the Appellant on 4th March 2010: “In the last 3 years, how many times has an ‘Executive Authority’ been authorised to conduct surveillance against police officers. Please provide details of the misconduct alleged and the outcome of each operation with regards to any sanction imposed.” 4. By letter dated 16th March 2010 the Appellant neither confirmed nor denied that it held the Requested Information relying upon the following FOIA exemptions: o section 40(5),3 o section 30(3), 4 o section 31(3) on the basis that complying with the duty to confirm or deny would, or would be likely to, prejudice the prevention or detection of crime and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders (section 31(1)(a) and (b)) and o section 44(2) FOIA 5 5. The IPSG applied for an internal review on 17th May 2010. The Appellant conducted an internal review the conclusions of which were dated 11th June 2010 which upheld this refusal notified to the Appellant on the same grounds. The Complaint to the Information Commissioner 6. The Appellant Complained to the Commissioner. In his Decision Notice FS50317117 dated 31st March 2011 the Commissioner: <U+F0B7> Held that none of the exemptions from the duty to confirm or deny were engaged; <U+F0B7> In relation to s31(1)(a) and (b) any information that might be held by the Appellant relevant to the request would not relate to criminal investigations; 3 Personal information 4 Investigations and proceedings conducted in relation to criminal matters by public authorities 5 Information covered by prohibitions on disclosure 5EA/2011/0114 <U+F0B7> Required the Appellant to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held. The Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant appealed dated 26th April 2011. In its grounds of Appeal (and clarified in its amended grounds of appeal dated 8th June 2011) the Appellant raised an additional exemption namely that the duty to confirm or deny was engaged pursuant to section 31(3) FOIA by reference to sections 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b) FOIA, because confirmation or denial would, or would be likely to, prejudice the exercise of its functions for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any improper conduct. 8. In an amended response dated 27 June 2011, the Commissioner accepted that, in light of the matters set out in the Appellant’s amended grounds of appeal: <U+F0B7> section 31(3) FOIA was engaged in this case by reference to sections 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b) FOIA. <U+F0B7> the Commissioner was satisfied that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information is held. 9. The Tribunal joined IPSG to this appeal on 10th June 2011. In their response dated 5th July 2011 they set out their grounds opposing the Appeal which can be summarized as arguments: a) Challenging that confirming or denying would be likely to cause prejudice and b) Arguing that the public interest lies in confirming or denying that the information is held. Legal Submissions and Analysis 10. Under the Freedom of information Act: 1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled – 6EA/2011/0114 (a) To be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request... 6) in this Act, the duty of a public authority to comply with subsection (1)(a) is referred to as the duty to confirm or deny. 11. The exemption to the duty to confirm or deny is found in s31 FOIA: (1)Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 306 is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice— (g) the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (2) The purposes referred to in subsection (1)(g) to (i) are— ... (b)the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is responsible for any conduct which is improper, .... (3)The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1). 12. The Tribunal is satisfied that in respect of each limb of the information request it must determine: ii) Whether section 31(3) is engaged by reference to s 31(1)(g) and 31(2)(b). iii) If so whether the public interest is in favour of Not Confirming or Denying that the information is held. 13. The Tribunal accepts the Commissioner’s submission that the “function” identified by 6 Investigations and proceedings conducted in relation to criminal matters by public authorities 7EA/2011/0114 a public authority for the purposes of section 31(1)(g) must be a function which is: (i) designed to fulfil one of the purposes specified in section 31(2) FOIA and, (ii) imposed by statute (or in the case of a government department, authorised by the Crown) and, (iii) specifically entrusted to the relevant public authority to fulfil (rather than just a general duty imposed on all public authorities). 14. The Tribunal accepts that the remit of the Professional Standards Department, (which is the department that would carry out surveillance under Executive Authority in cases where it is authorized), is responsible for investigating misdemeanours and misconduct alleged to have been committed by Officers and members of staff. The PSD’s remit is regulated within a statutory framework governed by the Police Reform Act 2002, and linked to the Police Act 1996 and the Police Conduct Regulations 2008. 15. The Tribunal is satisfied therefore that if information were held in relation to this request it would fall to be considered under s31. 16. The Appellant argues that confirming or denying whether the information is held would allow people to make deductions that would prejudice their ability to ascertain whether Officers and members of staff are responsible for any conduct which is improper. 17. They argue that confirming that the information is held would have the following effect: <U+F0B7> Allow those who have been investigated to know that Executive Authority may have been used against them. <U+F0B7> Allow individuals to adapt their behaviour to avoid detection. (Cross referencing the published disciplinary offences and the fact that it had been used might indicate the types of behaviour it was used to investigate). <U+F0B7> It risks alerting those who are currently subject to an ongoing investigation that they may be the subject of Executive Authority. 8EA/2011/0114 18. The IPSG argue that the exemption would not be engaged because: <U+F0B7> Officers and Staff are informed that they have been subject of an investigation and are served a discipline notice outlining the allegation, and their rights. <U+F0B7> The force publishes an internal newsletter regarding cases dealt with and the names of Officers disciplined. <U+F0B7> The fact that Executive Authority is a tool available to the PSD is known within the force as it is published on the intranet. 19. The Tribunal notes that confirmation of the fact of an investigation and the availability of an investigative tool, is not the same as confirmation that Executive Authority has been used. The information that an investigation has taken place (without disciplinary action being taken) is limited to the individuals concerned who have no duty to share that information, and circulation of the disciplinary list is limited to within the force, whereas disclosure under FOIA is to the World at Large. 20. The Tribunal accepts that confirmation that Executive Authority has been used might indicate to someone who knows that they have been investigated that it may have been used on them especially if they consider the seriousness of their misdemeanour when compared to the published list of those disciplined. However, since they would not know of others who had been investigated but not disciplined, confirmation that Executive Authority was used (even in a small Authority) would not provide unequivocal confirmation that it had been used in any particular case. 21. The Appellant argues that denying that the information is held would have the following effect: <U+F0B7> To provide unequivocal confirmation to those who have been doing wrong that they have NOT been subject to Executive Authority. <U+F0B7> This might embolden wrong doers and encourage potential wrong doers. <U+F0B7> Cross reference to the list of those disciplined, would allow staff and Officers to know the types of offence which have not attracted Executive Authority in the past and might encourage them to act in certain misconduct areas with relative impunity. 9EA/2011/0114 <U+F0B7> Reduce the efficacy of the deterrent effect by influencing the mindset of officers and staff minded to pursue “wrongdoings” based on the propensity of the force to use this law enforcement technique against its employees. 22. In relation to the first limb of the request, the Tribunal is not satisfied that s31(3) is engaged for the reasons set out in Confidential Schedule 27. 23. There is no dispute that in relation to the second limb of the request, confirming or denying that the information is held would indicate whether Executive Authority had in fact been used during the time specified. This is because of the terms of the request. It the Appellant holds information of the “outcome of the operation”, that can only be because there must have been an operation (which within the terms of the request would include the use of Executive Authority). In relation to limb 2 of the request the Tribunal is satisfied that s 31(3) FOIA is engaged because confirming or denying that the information is held would indicate whether Executive Authority had been used and the Tribunal is satisfied for the reasons set out above that this would prejudice the prevention and detection of misconduct. The public interest test in relation to limb 2 of the request 24. Section 31(3) FOIA is a qualified exemption and therefore subject to the public interest test as set out in s2(1)(b) FOIA: (1)Where any provision of Part II states that the duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to any information, the effect of the provision is that where... (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information, section 1(1)(a) does not apply. 7 This decision is accompanied by 2 confidential schedules. The first is disclosable to all the parties but is to remain confidential in all other respects and is not for promulgation. The second confidential schedule is not for disclosure to the public or the second respondent until after the Appellant has complied with the substituted decision notice. 10EA/2011/0114 26. In considering public interest factors applicable the Tribunal agrees with the approach set out in England & London Borough of Bexley v Information Commissioner EA/2006/0060 & 0066, at paragraph 65 which provides: (f) In considering public interest factors in favour of maintaining the exemption, they relate to the particular interest which the exemption is protecting..8. (g) The public interest factors in favour of disclosure are not so restricted and can take into account the general public interests in the promotion of transparency, accountability, public understanding and involvement in the democratic process. Factors favouring compliance with s1(1)(a) 27. The IPSG argues that: i. There is a need for informed public debate to further public understanding and involvement in the democratic process: <U+F0B7> It is argued that there is no clear legal basis for Executive Authority (unlike RIPA which is founded in statute), <U+F0B7> It does not appear that there was any consultation with Hampshire Police Authority (other than informing them that it was going to be implemented), ii. There is a lack of Transparency. The IPSG raise concerns that the procedure is being misused, it is supposed to be used only for serious misconduct falling short of criminal matters and only when this is the least intrusive or only way of obtaining the evidence. However, there is no way of knowing if: a) It is being used for minor misconduct cases, b) It is being used in conflict with the principle that it should only be used where evidence can be obtained through the least intrusive means. c) It is being used when criminal conduct is suspected and a RIPA authorization should be sought (e.g. whilst falsely claiming sick pay can constitute misconduct it can also constitute a criminal offence).9 8 In the Bexley case it was the prevention of crime 11EA/2011/0114 d) It is being used as a fishing expedition in cases where an investigation has failed to turn up evidence of wrongdoing. e) It is being used in a way that breaches Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. iii. There is a lack of Accountability <U+F0B7> The Authorising Officer for Executive Authority is the Head of PSD who is of Superintendent rank, <U+F0B7> The person authorizing the Executive Authority has no distance from the investigation as generally it authorized by the head of the investigating department, <U+F0B7> There is no statutory oversight or independent scrutiny or monitoring (unlike RIPA) with monitoring of the use of Executive Authority being conducted by the Authorising Officer. <U+F0B7> Subjects of Executive Authority have fewer avenues of complaint (e.g. their right to appeal to the IPCC is more limited than that of the general public). 28. The Tribunal notes that these are arguments largely in favour of disclosure of the substantive information requested (if it is held). It is not apparent that these public interests would be significantly advanced by the answer that information is or is not held. However, the Tribunal does consider this to be an argument relating to the public interest in transparency since the successful use of s31(3) FOIA stops an information request in its tracks and in the event that information is held, would prevent the consideration of the public interests in relation to the substantive information by the Tribunal. The public interest test requires the Tribunal to consider the public interest in all the circumstances of the case and the Tribunal is satisfied therefore that it is appropriate to consider the wider implications of complying with s1(1)(a). 9 The Tribunal notes that there is support for the IPSG’s argument on this point because the “wrong doings” that are said by the Appellant to be considered serious enough to investigate and consequently for which Executive Authority may be granted include a “criminal offence”. 12EA/2011/0114 29. Whilst the Tribunal accepts the principle that there is a need for informed public debate, the matters raised by the IPSG in this regard can all be argued from material already available and are unlikely to be significantly advanced by the information requested. 30. The Appellant (supported by the Commissioner) accepts that there is a public interest in transparency and accountability but argues that the weight of these factors is negated by virtue of the facts that there is some external supervision and monitoring. For example whilst surveillance other than RIPA does not fall within the Office of the Surveillance Commissioner’s (OSC) remit, they would look at what police forces around the country are doing regarding Executive Authority when visiting and inspecting forces. Additionally the Tribunal notes that the Appellant’s own procedure (02103) states that: 3.14.1Any staff member subject of covert surveillance activity authorised under Executive Authority may challenge its validity through application of the grievance procedure. In cases where the member of staff becomes the subject of misconduct proceedings, a right of challenge will exist under those proceedings. 3.14.2 Any person who considers that covert surveillance or interception of communications has been carried out, other than in accordance with the law, has a right of complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. Factors in favour of non compliance with s1(1)(a) 31. The Appellant repeats the matters set out in paragraphs 17 et seq which can be summarized as the argument that to confirm or deny would undermine ongoing investigations, reveal policing techniques, their level of use and risk identification of individual cases. It would either compromise the tactic or undermine its deterrent effect. Consistency they argue is in the public interest as it prevents inadvertent disclosure at a future date if a similar request is received at a later stage as inferences may be drawn from failing to state whether information is held in circumstances where s 1(1)(a) has previously been complied with. 13EA/2011/0114 32. The IPSG repeats its arguments as rehearsed at paragraph 18 above namely that the weight of these arguments is reduced by the information already disseminated within the force and to the subjects of investigation. 33. Upon consideration of all the material and arguments before it the Tribunal is satisfied that the balance of public interest lies in upholding the exemption to s1(1)(a) as set out in s31(3) FOIA. Conclusion and Remedy 34. The Tribunal is satisfied that in relation to the first limb of the information request s31(3) is not engaged and the Appellant has breached s1(1)(a) FOIA in failing to confirm or deny whether the information is held. In relation to the second limb of the information request, the Tribunal is satisfied that s31(3) is engaged and that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the information is held.

"125","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0137 Heard at Field House, London On 4th. July, 2017 Before Judge David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Members Paul Taylor and Suzanne Cosgrave Between Simon Cox Appellant and The Information Commissioner (“The ICO”) First Respondent and The Home Office Second RespondentAlison Pickup appeared for the Appellant The ICO did not appear but made written submissions. David Pievsky appeared for the Home Office. The Decision of the Tribunal The Tribunal finds (i) that the Home Office did not and does not hold information within the scope of the request other than that which has been disclosed. (ii) that disclosure of the names of the persons identified in the papers as “J”, “L” and “N“ would breach the First Data Protection Principle (“the FDPP”}, hence that the exemption provided by FOIA s.40(2) applies to such information The Decision Notice was in accordance with the law. The appeal is dismissed. The Tribunal does not require the Home Office to take any action in response to the Request. 1. Eritrea has, in recent times, experienced serious internal unrest which has resulted in widespread migration. A substantial number of migrants have entered or attempted to enter the United Kingdom. Such migration is a matter of serious concern both to the Home Office, which is responsible for border controls and immigration and to the Eritrean government. 2. In December, 2014 a small team from the Home Office (“the HO”) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (“the FCO”), led by Mr. Rob Jones of the HO and a senior civil servant from the FCO paid a short visit to Eritrea in order to obtain a clearer picture of the forces driving this migration and the Eritrean government’s attitude to migrants who returned. A meeting with Eritrean officials took place in Asmara on 9th. December, 2014. It wasattended by the five civil servants in the party and Mr. David Ward, the British ambassador. Mr. Rob Jones was Head of the Asylum and Family Policy unit. The other three HO civil servants, who were designated “J”, “L” and “N” respectively, in the written evidence and at the hearing, were then Grade 7 or Higher Executive Officer (“HEO”). All were policy officials in the International and Immigration Policy Group. Their roles will be further considered later in this decision. Other meetings with Eritrean officials took place and the party made further contacts for the purpose of gauging the attitude of the government and other interested parties to the causes of emigration and the treatment of returning migrants. 3. Following that meeting, Mr. Ward sent a Diptel to the FCO on 16th. December, 2014, recording discussions which the team had had with various Eritrean representatives, including the Foreign Minister, the Head of Political Affairs of the ruling party and the Director of the President’s Office. . 4. An email dated 17th. December, 2014 (“the 17/12 email”) was circulated by L to a number of senior and junior civil servants when the party returned to the UK. It described relevant impressions formed by the team during the visit, the responses of Eritrean officials at various meetings, the Eritrean government’s attitude to migration and the return of migrants, as assessed by L or by the team as a whole and the possible implications for any future action plan within the HO. 5. A series of four notes, two dated 9th. and two 10th. December, 2014, containing apparently direct quotations from the three senior officials referred to in §3 and three other civil servants on important subjects of discussion (“the quotation notes”) were created by J and later used in notes published by the HO (see §14 below).6. In February, 2015 an “Informal report of UK visit to Eritrea, 9 – 11 December, 2014” was prepared, evidently for the briefing of a minister. It covered the same issues as the Diptel and the email of 17th. December and was apparently based, at least in part, on the latter document. It involved more than one draft. 7. Mr. Cox is profoundly concerned over the UK government’s handling of Eritrean migration and asylum applications and has a considerable detailed knowledge of the issues involved. On 22nd. May, 2015 he submitted the following request to the HO – “1 Since 1st. October, 2014, what meetings have Home Office officials (at Grade SCS1 or above) held in Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia or Egypt with the governments of any of those countries to discuss migration. Please provide the dates of the meetings and the names of all those present. 2 Please provide the notes of those meetings.” 8. The HO responded on 10th. July, 2015 by referring Mr. Cox to a House of Lords written answer in respect of part of his request. It stated that it held further information which it refused to disclose, relying on the FOIA exemptions contained in s.27(1) (prejudice to international relations) and 40(2)( protection of personal data). 9. Mr. Cox’s request for an internal review was acknowledged but never met. On 6th. November, 2015, he complained to the ICO both as to delay and the response of 10th. July, 2015. 10. During the ICO’s ensuing investigation, the HO added to the cited exemptions s.36(2)(b)(i) (prejudice to the conduct of public affairs). It also informed Mr. Cox that the only meetings within the scope of his request were those in Eritrea during the visit in December, 2014.11. The Decision Notice (“the DN”) was issued on 3rd. May, 2016. The ICO found that s.27(1) was engaged and that the public interest favoured withholding the disputed information, which, at this juncture, comprised only the informal report dated February, 2015 and the submission made to the minister for the purposes of s.36(2)(b)(i). The DN further ruled that the names of J, L and N were their personal data and disclosure was not necessary for the pursuit of any legitimate interest of Mr. Cox. Disclosure would, therefore, breach the First Data Protection Principle (“the FDPP”). There was no ruling on the s.36(2)(b)(i) exemption. 12. Mr. Cox appealed. Initially, he appealed only against the finding that the names of Eritrean officials should not be disclosed and stated that the names of the junior civil servants in the December 2014 team “had never formed part of” his request for information. In August, 2016 he successfully applied to include in his grounds of appeal the withholding of the “notes of those meetings”. The HO, in its Response, disclosed an extract from the informal report which disclosed the names of the three senior Eritrean representatives referred to in §3. Subject to that disclosure it supported the findings of the DN. 13. There followed a series of exchanges and directions which it is unnecessary to recite here since the appeal changed course thereafter to a significant degree. 14. Prompted by a letter from Mr. Cox’s solicitors (“PLP”) which pointed out that the HO had in 2015 published in its Country Information and Guidance Notes (“CIG notes”) for Eritrea information about the December, 2014 meetings, the HO disclosed, on 22nd. November, 2016, the February, 2015 informal report. It stated that its witnesses in this appeal had beenunaware of the CIG notes and that, having considered the effect of those publications, it had reassessed the balance of public interests. 15. PLP then drew attention to the inclusion in the CIG notes of quotations from Eritrean representatives that did not appear in the informal report and argued that the HO must hold further information within the scope of the request, which had not been disclosed. The HO immediately responded by disclosing the “Quotation Notes” and unreservedly apologised for the failure to retrieve them in the course of the original search. Mr. Rapport of the Government Legal Department (“the GLD”), acting for the HO, indicated that a fresh search was being undertaken to check whether further relevant information had been missed. 16. A hearing scheduled for 28th. and 29th. November, 2016 was, inevitably, vacated. Directions were given for the HO to identify any further information within the scope of the request. 17. In January, 2017 the GLD answered requests from PLP, provided information to the Tribunal of further searches and disclosed documents which included the 17/12 email, the Diptel and a witness statement made by an HO senior executive officer in High Court proceedings, which referred to the December 2014 visit. The 17/12 email and the Diptel were, apparently, not deemed to be in scope during an internal review in 2015. Both were redacted to protect the names of junior civil servants and the email was further redacted to exclude passages which, it was contended, did not constitute “notes of those meetings”. Whether such passages are within scope is a matter for determination by the Tribunal. 18. In the light of these developments Mr. Cox applied a second time for permission to amend his grounds of appeal. In summary, he wished to argue –(i) that the HO held notes of meetings, which it had not disclosed, either because it had interpreted the request too narrowly or because its searches were inadequate. (ii) That it held the undisclosed names of those Eritrean officials whom it had not identified. (iii) That disclosure of the names of J, L and N would not breach the FDPP so that the HO could not rely on s.40(2) to justify withholding them. 19. Grounds (i) and (iii) embrace all the issues which the Tribunal was required to determine. Clearly, if Mr. Cox failed in his submission on (i), he must fail also on (ii). The appeal which finally emerged did not involve the exemptions provided by s.27(1) or s.36(2)(b)(i). The HO had abandoned both in the light of the published CIGs. The evidence and the submissions 20. Mr. Cox made a witness statement, the contents of which he confirmed. In that statement he questioned the HO assertion that neither J nor N sent emails or messages to HO colleagues on their return from Eritrea. He argued that they had probably not been alerted to HO acceptance that the Diptel and the 17th. December email were “notes”. As to J and N, backed by a wealth of organograms and HO publications and intricate cross - referencing, he purported to name them and then to demonstrate that their participation in a range of meetings and the drafting of advice following the Eritrea visit created a strong public interest in their public identification. He gave further oral evidence to justify his change of stance as to the public interest in these names, following the belated HO disclosures. The Tribunal’s decision was not influenced by that change.21. Simon Marsh, Head of the HO Knowledge and Information Management Unit (“KIMU”), a Senior Civil Servant (an “SC”) gave evidence for the HO as to the adequacy of searches carried out in response to Mr. Cox’s request and HO document retention policy. He explained that any manuscript notes of meetings during the Eritrean visit would have been destroyed as soon as their useful life was over. 22. He stated that the initial searches had been very wide but had focused on the Eritrean meetings as the only meetings within scope. L, from the Border and Immigration Directorate, provided the informal report, the s.36 submission to the minister (now irrelevant), the email of 17th. December and the Diptel. Mr. Marsh acknowledged that the HO was wrong to treat the last two documents as out of scope. 23. The Quotation Notes were not located during these searches. This, according to Rob Jones (see below) was because L, who located the information identified in §22, worked in a different directorate1 from J, who created them and L would not have known of their existence. J was involved in answering the request, it seems, only when further searches were required in November, 2016. 24. KIMU coordinated the subsequent searches (after the vacated hearing), although they were then particularly directed at the civil servants who participated in the Eritrea meetings. Those involved were asked to locate “anything relating to the February report”. They were asked for any record of the names of Eritrean participants in meetings other than those already identified. Nothing further was located. 1 The HO evidence provided a great deal of detail as to the structure of the organisational units dealing with asylum and immigration. It was a helpful guide to the intricate workings of the HO and the meaning of a range of acronyms but it is unnecessary to set it out in detail in this decision.25. The evidence as to both sets of searches was substantiated by emails reflecting the commissioning of searches, the requests made to individuals to assist and the responses of those individuals. 26. Mr. Marsh dealt also with the naming of junior officials. He referred to the familiar precept in Home Office v Information Commissioner EA/2011/0203 to the effect that the personal data, including names, of junior civil servants (in some cases a misleading term) are generally protected from disclosure unless they occupy a public – facing role. He acknowledged that there was no blanket rule and every case had to be treated on its particular facts. Grade 7 civil servants and HEO’s have important managerial and advisory functions. They often have significant responsibilities. Their reports and recommendations may go to ministers. However, where serious policy or resource issues are involved, a Grade 7 official or an HEO, must refer the matter to a Senior Civil Servant (an “SC”) who is accountable to the minister for the action taken. If a report by a Grade 7 civil servant goes to a minister, it does so because it has been vetted and approved by an SC. The SC, not the Grade 7, carries the can. This principle is enshrined in the HO Guidance which states that “G7s may contribute significantly to decisions taken by senior grades and ministers”. 27. Mr. Marsh concluded that the names of the officials could be of no use to the public. 28. Rob Jones dealt with the background to the December 2014 visit, the visit itself and both sets of searches. He stated that, in the course of the second series of searches, all participants had been asked and had confirmed that there was nothing relevant that had not by then been located. When cross examined he stressed the role of the SC in taking responsibility for serious decisions based to a greater or lesser extent on the work and recommendations of a junior civil servant. He contended that it would be unfair for a junior to be identified witha particular policy when he/she had worked on it but had not taken the decision to adopt it. Input is not the same as accountability. 29. Ms. Pickup, representing Mr. Cox, submitted a very full written submission running to 102 paragraphs, which covered the issues now confronting the Tribunal following the second amendment of his Grounds of Appeal. She made further oral submissions at the hearing. The Tribunal considered all the detailed arguments advanced but does not propose to review them at length in this decision. 30. As to the searches, she criticized the HO’s initial interpretation of “notes of meetings” as wrongly limiting the scope of the request to documents that described themselves as notes. The term should be construed as including any document (including emails) which records or reports on what transpired during the meetings, including any comments by the author. It was likely that the initial misinterpretation had narrowed the later searches by J, L, N and others, since there was no evidence that they had been alerted to the HO’s later, more liberal construction of the term and consequent disclosures. They would, therefore, exclude emails from their searches. It was most improbable that J, L or N had sent no emails to colleagues recording the content of meetings. It was equally implausible that all contemporaneous notes had been destroyed. 31. The Tribunal should assess the exclusions of text from the 17th. December email by reference to this wider interpretation. 32. Both in her skeleton argument and oral submissions, Ms. Pickup raised issues over four documents attached to a disclosed email from L dated 28th. November, 2016. The HO refused to disclose them on the ground that they were outside the scope of the request and maintained that position at thehearing. The Tribunal received copies of them and the nature of each was disclosed. They were - <U+F0B7> A submission to the minister and a wide range of SCs, proposing future action and objectives following the December 2014 visit; <U+F0B7> A paper setting out objectives for the “Proposed Eritrea visit”; <U+F0B7> A paper on migratory flows and Eritrea; <U+F0B7> An “Eritrea Migration Action Plan” Also attached was a copy of the Diptel, which had been disclosed. 33. Ms. Pickup argued that Mr. Cox was entitled to disclosure of these documents so that he could assess whether, and, if appropriate, argue that, they were in scope. She submitted that a refusal by the Tribunal to order disclosure for that purpose would breach his rights under ECHR Article 10 and violate the principle of open justice. The Tribunal rejected those submissions for reasons summarized at § 61 below. 34. As to disclosure of names, she argued, without doubt correctly, that there was no general rule as to withholding the names of junior civil servants, as the Tribunal in Home Office v ICO had acknowledged. There is, in general, she submitted, a legitimate interest in disclosure of the names of public officials exercising public functions and powers in the public interest2. The HO Guidance did not bear out Mr. Marsh’s contentions and it routinely published the names of officials who were neither SCs nor in public – facing roles, as the exhibits to Mr. Cox’s evidence showed. It was accepted by the HO that J, L and N performed highly responsible roles during and after the visit to Eritrea, including submissions to ministers, coordinating policy documents and briefing senior officials and ministers. The immigration issues to which these activities related were and are of great public interest. 2 There was no reported authority for this bold proposition.35. The HO case on all three issues can be concisely described; <U+F0B7> A “note of a meeting “ is a document which records and was intended to record what was said at the meeting. It does not cover analysis, commentary, feedback or the expression of the author’s views, as Mr. Cox asserted. <U+F0B7> The evidence before the Tribunal, from witnesses and documents, demonstrated an ultimately exhaustive series of searches which were very likely to have captured any information within scope. The range of information specified to the searchers was much wider than the request demanded (see §24 above). <U+F0B7> Disclosure of names was not necessary for Mr. Cox’s legitimate purposes. Disclosure for FOIA purposes of the roles and functions of J, L and N, which had been provided in exchanges before the hearing to Mr. Cox personally, made the HO case even clearer. Mr. Cox’s objective could have been fully achieved by a request for such information at any time. The reasons for our decision 36. We deal first with the largely academic issue raised by Ms. Pickup as to whether it would be right to dismiss this appeal, whatever our findings, given that the HO abandoned reliance on s.27(1) following the discovery of related material which it had published. An appeal is decided by reference to the issues raised in the Grounds of Appeal. As amended on Mr. Cox’s application, they were (i) the adequacy of the HO searches, hence the probability that it held further responsive information, which it had not identified and (ii) whether the names of J. L and N should be disclosed because the s.40(2) exemption failed. Ground (i) was raised for the first time in the amendment and is rejected in this decision. Ground(ii) was dealt with in the DN which rejected Mr. Cox’s claim and also fails on appeal. It was open to Mr. Cox todiscontinue this appeal following his success in relation to s.27(1). He did not do so and then failed on the outstanding live issues. The appeal, as ultimately presented, is therefore dismissed. 37. We turn to the issues relating to the adequacy of the searches. 38. “The Notes of those meetings”, whether framed in the singular or the plural, is not a term of art but a quite common expression in widespread use. Plainly, the title attached to the document is immaterial. What matters is its content and the purpose for which it was created. A mere reference to a specific meeting does not qualify the document concerned as a note of that meeting. The HO submission that it is a document which recorded and was intended to record what was said, is, in the Tribunal’s view, a sensible working definition. It will normally, but not always, be created during or soon after the meeting by a participant. A document, which is prepared from rough notes made at the meeting and intended to replace them, satisfies the definition. A later reference to what was agreed at the meeting in a report, designed to justify a proposed action or brief a superior, does not, because its purpose is not to preserve a record of what was said, whether for the author or a third party, but to show how or why particular action has been or should be taken. 39. Still less is commentary on or analysis of the content of a meeting a note of that meeting because its purpose is quite different. A s.36(2) submission to the minister is not a note of the meeting, although it may well use such a note to describe the discussions at the meeting. Its purpose is not to record but to persuade the minister, as a “qualified person” to issue an opinion as to potential prejudice to specified government activities. 40. In this case Mr. Cox asked for “the notes of those meetings”. It may be a minor pointer but the use of the definite article tends to suggest records akin to informal minutes rather than a broader range of referential material.41. We therefore reject Mr. Cox’s much wider interpretation of “notes of those meetings” quoted at §30 as contrary to normal usage and largely unworkable. It could capture a multitude of documents created long after the event by persons who had nothing to do with it and referred to it for purposes quite unrelated to the retention of a record of what was said. 42. The medium in which the note is recorded is, of course, irrelevant. Many notes will be prepared as emails providing a record both for the participant who sends them and the recipient who needs to be apprised of what was said. 43. Applying this interpretation to the central documents here, the Diptel was plainly a note as were the 17th. December, 2014 email and L’s “quotation notes”. The characterization of the informal February report may be less clear but was readily conceded anyway. The descriptions of the four documents referred to at §32 clearly indicate that they fall well outside what the Tribunal considers the correct definition, as was confirmed when we read them at the hearing. Accordingly, they were not disclosed3. 44. For the same reasons, we have no doubt that the redacted closing passages in the 17th. December 2014 email are out of scope. They are comments relating to future action, perhaps stimulated by the meeting but in no way recording anything said there. 45. Having regard to our ruling as to the meaning of “notes of those meetings”, there was very little risk that searchers involved in the later exercise would interpret their mission to uncover anything relating to the February report in unduly restrictive terms. 3 The procedural issue relating to these documents is dealt with at § 61.46. As to the adequacy of the searches, it is understandable that Mr. Cox should scrutinize very carefully the evidence as to searches, given the HO’s failures to present the full picture at an earlier stage of these proceedings. 47. However, the Tribunal accepts that, by the conclusion of the later searches, the relevant directorate had conducted as thorough an operation as was reasonable in all the circumstances. The terms of search were wide and all those directly participating in the Eritrea visit were fully engaged in it. As already indicated, we do not believe that they were in any way misled as to the targets of the searches. It is perfectly reasonable for manuscript notes to be destroyed once a more substantial record, such as the 17/12 email has been made. We should not expect the group leader, Rob Jones to make notes, when he was likely to be a prominent participant. It is not obvious that those present would send email reports of what was said to colleagues upon their return. 48. On a balance of probabilities, which is the relevant standard of proof, we reject the submissions that the HO holds further unreported responsive information or that it has redacted information from disclosed documents which was caught by the request or that the four undisclosed documents (§32) were or might be within scope. 49. The names of J, L and N have been withheld in reliance on s.40(2) of FOIA. It is accepted that those names are the personal data of those three persons and that they are disclosable only if, pursuant to DPA Schedule 2 condition 6, disclosure is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests (pursued in this case, by Mr. Cox and others concerned with the Horn of Africa). If those requirements are not met, disclosure would be unfair, regardless of other considerations and would breach the FDPP, hence satisfy the requirements of s.40(2). 50. As already indicated, the HO provided Mr. Cox with what were broadly job descriptions relating to the three shortly before the hearing, though for thepurposes of conducting this appeal, not under FOIA. Ms. Pickup raised the issue whether they should not be disclosed under FOIA, that is, to the general public. The Tribunal invited written submissions on the question. Ms. Pickup submitted that they should. They had been referred to at an open hearing and the starting point was that they were now public documents and anybody was now entitled to make use of them as they chose. R. (on the application of Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates' Court [2012] EWCA Civ 420, [2013] Q.B. 618. This was subject to the Tribunal’s power to prohibit disclosure pursuant to Rule 14(1) of the 2009 Rules, though such power must be exercised with due regard to the principles of open justice and fairness. Mr. Pievsky, for the HO, argued that these documents were not within the scope of the request but stated that the HO did not object to disclosing them (subject to redaction of personal data) and was willing to treat an application for disclosure from Mr. Cox (which has been made) as a FOIA request with which the HO would comply. He argued, however, that the last sentence in each document contained the personal data of the individual concerned and that they should be redacted accordingly, although referred to in the evidence. The Tribunal, following subsequent discussion by telephone conference, decided to direct that the redacted passages should not be disclosed because disclosure was unnecessary to any legitimate purpose. Subject to that direction, the job descriptions should be disclosed under FOIA. 51. As to the general issue of disclosure of names, a substantial body of evidence on both sides was concerned with the grades and functions of J, L and N. It is unnecessary to repeat here the undisputed evidence as to their grades and the kind of work each performed. The Home Office v The Information Commissioner is a useful starting point as to the desirable limits on protection of personal data in this context but, in each case, much depends on the nature of the legitimate interest (if any) which would be furthered by disclosure.52. This appeal involves two Grade 7s and an HEO. The important and responsible nature of much of their work has been acknowledged already. The critical limitation, in our view, is that they are not decision makers, however valuable their input to decisions. Rob Jones provided the clearest and most persuasive evidence that every report, advice or recommendation goes to an SC, who is accountable for its subsequent adoption or rejection. He or she takes responsibility if it is submitted as a recommendation to a minister or adopted as departmental policy. Ministers and SCs are policy makers, not Grade 7s. We reject Ms. Pickup’s bold contention, unsupported by authority, that there is a legitimate interest “in disclosure of the names of public officials exercising public functions and powers in the public interest”. That wide – ranging and indiscriminate formula would strip a high proportion of public servants, including many of quite junior rank, of protection of their personal data. 53. There is a plain public interest in tracing the development of possibly controversial policies from their birth to their implementation, especially in such areas as asylum and immigration, which rouse strong public concerns from very different angles. 54. It may well be that the involvement of a particular junior minister or SC in the development and adoption of a policy is a matter of legitimate public interest because he/she took decisions critical to its implementation. It is far less clear that the public has a legitimate interest in the contributions, great or small, of those who researched, advised, recommended particular strategies underlying the policy to those who took the decisions. If a particular HEO produced a particularly perceptive report which was influential in persuading the Home Secretary or a junior minister to change course in relation to migration from country X, should that HEO be exposed by name to the media because his ideas, not his decisions, led to a particular controversial, perhaps unpopular, policy?55. Mr. Cox’s concerns for relations with the countries of the Horn of Africa and related issues of migration and financial aid are undoubtedly a legitimate public interest for the purpose of Condition 6. The question is whether disclosure of the names of civil servants of middle rank who made important contributions to action programmes but were not accountable for policy or significant decisions are necessary to understanding what the Home Office is doing in this region. 56. We were wholly unpersuaded that identifying the involvement of a named Grade 7 in preparing a particular report, drafting advice and then attending an important related meeting at which particular views were expressed or policies discussed had serious value for one sharing Mr. Cox’s concerns. Nowhere in his evidence did he demonstrate any such value. 57. We therefore find that Mr. Cox‘s case falls well short of demonstrating that the names of the Grade 7/HEOs are necessary to the furtherance of legitimate interests in UK policy in relation to the countries in the Horn of Africa and their resident and migrating populations. 58. The ready availability of the job descriptions further strengthens the HO case. Even if there were a legitimate interest in learning that particular actions were performed and significant advice tendered by civil servants of a given grade with specific functions and skills, the names of those concerned add nothing to the information supplied. That information is now in the public domain and could have been obtained by Mr. Cox by a FOIA request at any time. 59. His researches designed to identify the three civil servants have no bearing on our decision. The same goes for the evidence that the HO publishes the names of Grade 7s in some circumstances. That is not surprising. All depends on the context and what, if anything, it reveals about the specific work of thatindividual. In any case, inconsistency in HO policy, if proved, would not affect the rights of individuals under the DPA. 60. This is a case where the question of fair processing of personal data is best approached by first examining whether the specific requirements of condition 6 are met, regardless of whether, in a more general sense, disclosure of names would be fair. They are not. This ground of appeal also fails. 61. As indicated at §33, an issue arose as to the correct procedure to be adopted in relation to disclosure of the four documents described at §32. Ms. Pickup asserted that they should be disclosed to Mr. Cox personally (i.e., not as a FOIA disclosure) so as to enable him to argue the question whether they were in scope, if so advised. The HO was unwilling to provide them to him on that basis because that would imply an uncontrolled right in a requester to participate in decisions as to what was in scope and would preempt decisions as to whether the document was in scope and, if it was, whether an exemption applied. 62. The ICO was not represented at the hearing so could not perform the amicus role which she commonly does in sessions from which the requester is excluded. The Tribunal did not consider that an adjournment for the appointment of special counsel to represent Mr. Cox’s interests was proportionate or furthered the overriding objective, in so far as it requires justice to be administered without unjustifiable delay or unwarranted cost. It therefore proposed that it should read the documents and form a provisional, or possibly a definitive view as to the scope issue. It should then reconvene the hearing and indicate whether it considered there was an arguable case that any of the documents was within the reach of the request. 63. Ms. Pickup argued forcefully that this would breach Mr. Cox’s Article 10 rights and deny him his right to open justice. She submitted that this issue was quitedifferent from that which routinely arises where the Tribunal reads withheld information and hears evidence and argument in relation to it in closed session. 64. The Tribunal disagreed. The general nature of the four documents was apparent from their descriptions and none suggested a record akin to a note of the meetings. It retired and read the documents. All three members were satisfied that none of the four could reasonably be described as a note of a meeting. Each referred to the Eritrean visit. One predated that visit. The others – as their descriptions suggest – were concerned with future policy and problems involving Eritrean migration, not the content of meetings in December, 2014. 65. In Browning v Information Commissioner [2014] EWCA Civ 1050 [2014] 1 W.L.R. 3848 the Court of Appeal, taking account of the enactment in Rule 35(2) of the 2009 Rules of a power to hold the whole or part of a hearing in private, approved the exercise of such a power where protection of the interests of all parties required it and where all reasonably available measures were adopted to mitigate prejudice to the excluded party and his legal representative. An important measure is normally the acceptance by the ICO of responsibility for raising matters during the closed session which the excluded party would have raised, if present. A corresponding measure was not available on this appeal. However, as already stated, Mr. Cox was provided with informative descriptions of the documents concerned, which strongly indicated that they were not within the scope of his request. The Tribunal considered them in the absence of all parties and heard no submissions from the HO in closed session. It studied the four documents, satisfied itself as to their nature and, in open session, gave its assurance to Ms. Pickup and Mr. Cox that they were not remotely capable of fulfilling his request. It gave further general descriptions of the documents to Mr. Cox when doing so. This was a pragmatic procedure designed to do justice without a lengthy adjournment, which the material didnot justify. If that assurance did not satisfy Ms. Pickup, that is regrettable but cannot affect the outcome. 66. The alternative course of providing the documents to Mr. Cox so that he could make submissions opens the door to demands from a requester to examine any information of which he is aware so as to satisfy himself as to whether he may claim that it be disclosed under FOIA. That is a recipe for delay and increased costs. It also poses formidable problems where exemptions may arise in addition to the question of scope. 67. Article 10 confers a qualified, not an absolute right to receive information. The Tribunal considers that the procedure adopted respected Mr. Cox’s convention and common law rights, whilst avoiding unreasonable delay and cost. 68. For these reasons the Tribunal dismisses this appeal. 69. This is a unanimous decision. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge, 27th. July, 2017 Promulgated – 7th August, 2017"
"40","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0013 Decided without a hearing, on the papers On 11th July 2019 and 2nd December 2019 Before JUDGE FIONA HENDERSON TRIBUNAL MEMBERS GARETH JONES DAVE SIVERS Between GLEN MARKEY APPELLANT and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER RESPONDENT And STAFFORDSHIRE POLICE SECOND RESPONDENT DECISION AND REASONS Decision 1. The Appeal is allowed in part, however, in relation to the majority of the information the appeal is refused and should be withheld under s40(2) and s40(5) FOIA and s38(1) FOIA. Introduction 2. This is an appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision notice FS50745966 dated 20th December 2018 which upheld Staffordshire Police’s reliance on s38(1), s40(2) FOIA (Personal Data) and s40(5) FOIA to withhold the requested information. Background 3. The Appellant’s daughter tragically took her own life. The Police were called to the scene and took statements from witnesses, they investigated but there were no criminal proceedings. There was an inquest and the Police file was forwarded to the Coroner. Prior to the inquest the Police visited the Appellant and gave him an 1oral summary of some of the witness statements in order to forewarn him of what he was likely to hear at the inquest. He attended the inquest. Following the inquest he was provided with a CD recording of the inquest hearing itself. He wrote to the Coroner asking for a full copy of the material that was prepared for and presented to the Coroner for use at the inquest1. The Coroner provided him with: • 4 typed witness statements, • Confirmation that 2 witnesses had not provided written statements, • A 7 page “Summary of Incident” compiled by the investigating officer, which included a synopsis of 17 witnesses (including the 4 witnesses for whom full statements had been provided). 4. The coroner clarified by letter dated 1st August 2017 that: “At the inquest use was made of the main documents from the police file. There are various other documents but it is not normal practice to disclose documents not used. If you wish to pursue this I would suggest that you contact the police first of all”. Information Request 5. On 14th August 2017 the Appellant wrote to Staffordshire Police asking: “On [date removed] my daughter [name removed] took her own life, following an interview at [school details removed]. Police officers from the region deal with this case and took witness statements and created a file for the inquest which was held on [date removed]. Investigating officers included, [names removed]. I believe they were working on behalf of [name removed] who oversaw the collation of the case file for the Coroner. I recently wrote to the Coroner [name removed] and was able to attain some of the information used in the inquest, but he was unable to supply anything further and suggested that I contacted the Police for the fuller information. To that end, under the FOI act I am now requesting to receive copies of ALL information that the Police hold in relation to this case please. This should include, but not be limited to:- Original initial witness statements (not summaries) from ALL witnesses interviewed including: - [7 names redacted] The road traffic and air ambulance witness reports and subsequent hospital reports The Police Form A and Form C information The case file (in full) that was presented to the Coroner for use at the inquest, including the summarised witness statements, the road traffic photographs of accident etc. I hope I have given you enough background information her[sic] to be able to retrieve all information that is available? I am more than happy to cover any administrative fees. I presume there should be no problem with this request as the information is essentially public domain material? I also hope that my 1 Letter 14.6.17 attached to Appellant’s adjournment evidence. 2request has been channelled through the correct route: If not, I would very much appreciate you letting me know as to where I should send this request”. 6. Staffordshire Police provided a substantive response on 2.10.17 indicating that it held some of the requested information but refusing to confirm or deny whether they held the witness statements of the named individuals (relying upon s40(5) FOIA. They refused to provide the information that they held subject to s30(1)(a), s38(1) (health and safety), s40(2) FOIA (Personal Data) FOIA. The Appellant asked for an internal review which upheld 2 the exemptions relied upon and explained that: i. Under FOIA it is not possible to release information to a single applicant, disclosure is considered to be available to the world at large.3 ii. With respect of data already in the public domain “this has been summarised by the coroner and is a synopsis of what he has seen fit to release, summarised in his own words and released in an abridged format”.4 iii. With reference to the witness statements a) A statement by an individual is recorded information about that individual, b) The statements were made in confidence in the belief that their public use would be limited to legal proceedings. Disclosure would breach those individuals’ rights under DPA and may be upsetting. 7. The Appellant wrote on 12.2.185: a) Asking if he could have access to view the information (rather than being provided with a copy). b) Arguing that as the case file was handed to the Coroner it was already in the public domain. c) Asking if there was any other way open to him to access the information. 8. Staffordshire Police responded on 27.2.19 that: i. viewing the information would be a beach of the Data Protection Principles and there was no provision for inspection to him alone under FOIA or any other services provided by the Central Disclosure Unit. ii. Passing the file to the Coroner did not place it in the public domain, individuals would have to be in Court to hear the information and limited information was reported by the media. Complaint to the Commissioner 9. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 11.5.18 about the way his request for information had been handled arguing: i. As his late daughter’s father he should have the right to see all the information. 2 It was dated27.11.17 but not received by the Appellant until resent on 15.1.18 3 Arising from correspondence on 11.11.17 when the Appellant had offered to keep any data provided confidential and to abide by a legal framework to enforce this undertaking of confidentiality. 4 Arising from correspondence on 11.11.17 when the Appellant had argued that the information was in the public domain as it had been released to the coroner for the public inquest. The information used at the inquest was based on the requested information and the Coroner has provided the Appellant with summaries. 5 The Appellant had been sent consent forms Staffordshire Police subsequently explained this would have enabled a subject access request to be made by the witnesses under DPA but it was not certain how much information would be disclosed via application made in that manner. And that it appeared that the forms were sent in error. 3ii. He had suggested controlled methods in which the data could be released. iii. Access to the data would provide substantial closure and denial was causing a tremendous amount of stress. iv. The refusal raised suspicions as to why the data was not being released. 10. During the Commissioner’s investigation Staffordshire Police revised its position and provide the complainant with: a reconstruction diagram, photographs of the scene and a Police officer’s statement (the officer had consented to disclosure). They withdrew their reliance on s30(1)(a). 6 The Commissioner upheld Staffordshire Police’s decision. Appeal 11. The Appellant appealed on12/01/2019. His grounds can be summarised as: i) a challenge to the application of s40 FOIA in particular the expectations of data subjects and the legitimate interests assessed in considering fairness under the Data Protection Act. ii) A challenge that s38 was engaged and the application of the public interest test. iii) Disclosure with redaction of identifying personal data and the details of the suicide event and medical treatment afterwards should be considered. 12. The Commissioner opposes the appeal relying upon her Decision Notice and the Chief Constable of Staffordshire Police was joined as Second Respondent on 26.2.19 and also opposes the Appeal relying upon her submissions before the Commissioner. 13. All parties have consented to the case being determined on the papers. The appeal was considered at a paper hearing on 11th July 2019 and adjourned as the panel did not have sufficient information to determine the issues raised by the appeal. The Tribunal has had regard to all the documentary information before it: an open bundle of 215 pages, a closed bundle and the evidence and submissions in response to the Tribunal’s adjournment directions. 7 The Tribunal is in receipt of submissions from all parties on: • the impact or relevance of the provisions of the Coroner’s Rules 2013. • Expectation of witnesses in light of the fact of an inquest. It has been provided with, a copy of the documentary evidence disclosed by the Coroner. Additionally, 5 pages of the closed material and an email previously withheld under rule 14 were disclosed with redactions. The Tribunal is satisfied that it has been provided with a copy of the information within scope that is held and that it now has sufficient information to determine the case. 14. The Tribunal has a continuing duty to review rule 14 and is satisfied that further material from the redacted email should be disclosed namely the first redaction on p2 of the email. The Tribunal is satisfied from information disclosed by the Coroner that the Appellant is aware of this information. The Tribunal is satisfied 6 Investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities 7 Dated 13th August 2019 4that no harm will arise from its disclosure and it is in the interests of justice to do so as its redaction makes the rest of the email harder to read. The Tribunal reminds itself that disclosure pursuant to the appeal is different from disclosure under FOIA as there is power to restrict the use of information disclosed under rule 14 although on the facts of this case the Tribunal does not make such an order in relation to this sentence. Scope: 15. The Appellant has made various arguments as to the application of the Coroner’s Rules in his case: • He questions what the Coroner meant by being “content” to disclose parts of the information, • He questions what the status is of the Coroner’s reliance on “normal practice”. • He argues that the wording of rule 13(b) (The Coroners (Inquests) Rules 2013 entitles him to the entirety of the file. • He questions whether he should have been directed to rule 23(d) to be provided with a copy of written evidence. These issues are outside of our jurisdiction as disclosure to an interested person is a separate issue to disclosure under FOIA, we have no power to review the lawfulness of the Coroner’s application of the Coroner’s Rules. 16. In his open adjournment comments of 11.09.19 the Appellant gives reasons as to why he wishes disclosure of Child Death Overview Panel Form A. This was specified in his initial request, however, in his email of 13/09/2017 the Appellant indicated (contrary to his original request): “it is not the Form A and Form C themselves I wish to see, but any supporting information that the Police hold which would have fed into these forms8.” This clarification was received prior to the complaint to the Commissioner. Despite the Appellant stating in the same letter: “…I would like to receive the fullest set of information possible that the Police hold on file in relation to this case. Essentially from the initial notification to the police, through to final case file production for the coroner.” we are satisfied that Staffordshire Police were entitled to rely upon the Appellant’s explicit exclusion of those documents notwithstanding the generality of the rest of the information he sought. Consequently, we are satisfied that Form A and C are not within the scope of the request. S40 FOIA personal data 17. S40 FOIA provides: 8 P102 open bundle 5(2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a)it constitutes personal data… and (b) the first … condition below is satisfied. (3 )The first condition is that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act— (a) would contravene any of the data protection principles… (5)The duty to confirm or deny— (a)does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b)does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i)the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles … Is the withheld information personal data? 18. Staffordshire Police have clarified that within the withheld information are statements from a wide range of individuals, some in their professional role i.e. NHS, school staff, third parties and some as passers-by to the incident. They state that it is clear from the Appellant’s request that he does not know who has or has not made statements as some of the names he has quoted are not individuals that Staffordshire Police have been in touch with and therefore they rely upon s40(5) not to confirm nor deny that they hold that information. The withheld information was divided into the following categories by the Commissioner in her decision notice: • Details of witnesses and witness statements • Information about the driver • Incident summary pack • Traffic and case management documents • Communications re inquest • Traffic collision details • Officer notes 19. Personal data is defined in s1(1) of the DPA as “…data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— 6(a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual; 20. From this we are satisfied that information about the Appellant’s daughter is her data and does not fall within the definition of personal data as she is deceased, consequently it cannot fall within the s40 FOIA exemption. The Commissioner does not appear to have considered this separately. 9 Information relating to her is still capable of falling within the personal data of a 3rd party where it defines their relationship with the deceased (e.g. that she is a data subject’s relative, friend or pupil). Similarly, their knowledge about her is personal data about them (e.g. to use an example that does not apply in the closed material a postcard from her that has been received by them). We have had regard to the withheld information and we are satisfied that the majority of the information constitutes personal data recording as it does the personal details of those in contact with the Police relating to the incident and its investigation. Where we are satisfied that the information is solely the deceased’s personal data this has been considered under s38 FOIA. The first data protection principle 21. The first data protection principle states that personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular shall not be processed unless a least one of the conditions in schedule 2 is met. We are satisfied that disclosure would constitute processing (as it is an action taken with respect of the data). In assessing fairness we adopt the approach taken by the Commissioner and take into account: i. The reasonable expectation of the data subject, ii. The consequences of disclosure (would it cause unnecessary or unjustified damage or distress to the individual concerned?) iii. The balance between the rights and freedoms of the data subjects and the legitimate interests of the public. Reasonable expectation 22. The Appellant argues that the data subjects’ reasonable expectation can be ascertained by seeking their consent to disclosure. This was done in relation to the Officer in the case whose statement was disclosed. Whilst we accept that consent is relevant to reasonable expectation, in this case none of those whose data is being withheld have consented. FOIA does not require that the public authority actively seek out consent of every data subject. We have had regard to the enquiries that Staffordshire Police have made in relation to obtaining consent10 and are satisfied that these efforts are proportionate on the facts of this case. We have had regard to 9 Paragraph 33 Decision Notice 10 As summarised at p 59-60 7the seniority of the professional witnesses, the views on disclosure received, the nature of the incident and the level of involvement of those named in the withheld information in forming this view. 23. It is not disputed that at the time when witnesses made statements an inquest was inevitable and we are satisfied that any reasonable person would have been aware of the possibility of legal scrutiny in the form of an inquest and possibly other proceedings such as a criminal or civil case (which had not yet been ruled out). We accept that an inquest is a public process wherein the press and public can attend. The Appellant is an “interested person” (for the purposes of the Coroners Rules 2013) as the Father of the deceased 11 and as such was provided with a CD recording of the inquest hearing and copies of some of the witness statements and other summaries pursuant to his rights under rule 13 of the Coroners Rules 2013 which provides: 13.(1) Subject to rule 15, where an interested person asks for disclosure of a document held by the coroner, the coroner must provide that document or a copy of that document, or make the document available for inspection by that person as soon as is reasonably practicable. (2) Documents to which this rule applies include— (a)any post-mortem examination report; (b)any other report that has been provided to the coroner during the course of the investigation; (c)where available, the recording of any inquest hearing held in public, but not in relation to any part of the hearing from which the public was excluded under rule 11(4) or (5); (d)any other document which the coroner considers relevant to the inquest. The exceptions in rule 15 include the situations where: (c) the request is unreasonable; … (e) the coroner considers the document irrelevant to the investigation. 24. The Appellant argues that the witnesses had no expectation of confidentiality. His evidence was that he was afforded the opportunity to ask questions of witnesses at the inquest, he was not provided with copies of the witness statements prior to the inquest but the Police visited the Appellant prior to the inquest to run through some of the content that was likely to be used at the inquest with the objective of lessening the impact of the details in advance. This took place by way of an oral reading of selected documents and no documents were provided. 25. The Appellant relies upon the fact that: • There was no onward restriction on the information he was provided with verbally by the Police. • The documents from the Coroner were provided with no onward restriction as to use. 11 CJA 2009 s 47(2)(a) 8He argues that this means that they are disclosed to the world at large and should therefore be disclosed under FOIA. • The witnesses had no control as to how much of their statement would be given out loud at the inquest (the information was available for the Coroner to use) and the Appellant could have chosen to ask questions exercising his right under the rules. • Under rule 23 Coroner’s Rules there is the possibility that the statement in its entirety might be read out and placed on the record. The Appellant’s case is that by volunteering the information they have consented to the onward use of their information without restriction. • In relation to some witnesses the complete typed statement has been provided, • In relation to others their names and a summary of their statement has been provided. • This information has been provided without separate consent having been sought from the witnesses. He argues that the ability of the Coroner to disclose this information and put it into the public domain is consistent with there being no expectation that the information would not become public. 26. The Commissioner and Police argue that none of the factors relied upon by the appellant translate into an expectation that the witness statements (or information provided to the Police) would be disclosed to the world at large under FOIA. Although the Appellant has certain rights these are specific to him as a bereaved father and are exercised by the Coroner (rule 13) and the investigating police force (by way of family liaison12). Disclosure by the Coroner is subject to an interested person asking for the information, the recipient’s choice as to whether they would choose to disclose the information more widely and it is subject to a gatekeeping process both by the Police when they update the family and the Coroner who has discretion in determining what is relevant to the investigation. The Appellant appears to acknowledge this point stating: “the Coroner would need to be selective as part of his judgment about what is required for the purposes of facilitating the Inquest”.13 27. We are not assisted by rule 23 as specific criteria have to be met and we do not consider it likely that a witness would have this in mind at the time of speaking to the Police. We observe from the typed statements provided to the Appellant under rule 13 that they are headed “Restricted (when complete)” and that the signature is prefaced with: “This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it, knowing that if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false, or do not believe to be true”. 28. We are satisfied that this colours the expectation of disclosure of the typed witness statements indicating that it is not expected to be generally available but that it may need to be in the context of legal process. The use of the word “if [it is tendered in evidence]” in our judgment allows for the expectation that it may not be used in 12 presumably the legitimate interest of informing a bereaved parent outweighing the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. However, this is not under FOIA. 13 P3 019 119019 adjournment submissions 9which case the expectation from the header would be that it would not become public. We are satisfied that the disclosure by the Police and Coroner to the bereaved family is consistent with its use as part of the legal process. We are not persuaded by the Appellant’s argument that the breadth of the information potentially caught under rule 13 means that the same information should be disclosed under FOIA, as this is the exercise of a separate right. Disclosure under FOIA cannot take into consideration the relationship of the requestor to the deceased, as the same response would have to be given to a journalist, activist, or any other member of the public. 29. We are satisfied that there would be even less expectation of disclosure without restriction into the public domain of the raw information that went into the making of witness statements or which could have been put in witness statements if (as the appellant suspects witness statements were not taken from everyone that the Police were in contact with). The Appellant believes that the raw information would include: radio and telephone calls, handwritten notes and draft statements. This type of information if it is held, we are satisfied would be provided in the expectation that it would be used to assist the Police with their enquiries but not yet with the expectation that it would be used in open Court or placed in the public domain. We are satisfied that the general public is familiar with the concept of a witness statement and would expect to have the opportunity to check the accuracy and completeness of information attributed to them and to discuss whether they were prepared for it to be used in Court proceedings as evidenced by the declaration upon and process of making a witness statement. The consequences of disclosure (would it cause unnecessary or unjustified damage or distress to the individual concerned?) 30. We have had regard to the distressing nature of the incident. All those whose personal data is contained within the withheld material can be expected to have been traumatised by the incident (whether as someone who knew her, who witnessed the incident or who had to deal with the aftermath). We accept the evidence that some witnesses received counselling, staff at the school were traumatised; with one not returning to work for 18 months following the event. The headmaster when spoken to 2 years after the incident stated that staff were still fragile. 31. The Appellant contends that consideration of whether disclosure would be upsetting was based on judgments made in 2015 when the information request was later. In our judgment whilst the passage of time can be expected to lessen the psychological impact; as memories become less immediate, nevertheless we are satisfied that being confronted with the detail of personal involvement in such a distressing event would be likely to reopen psychological wounds that had been repairing. Statements and calls to the Police use the own words of the witnesses, this can be expected to be raw, frank and explicit. We are satisfied that witnesses confronted with the repetition of their own words in the public domain without warning, out of context (in that it would not be pursuant to legal proceedings) would find this particularly shocking. 1032. The Appellant has stated that he “has no such intentions of releasing information to the world at large”14 However, there is no power to restrict usage under FOIA. Additionally, the Commissioner observed that the Appellant had “a contingent intention to share the information widely, depending on his personal assessment of it”. The Appellant disagrees with this15 however, the Tribunal understands it to be a reference to the Appellant’s observation that:: “I do not intend to disclose any information once I have received it, unless there was anything untoward in the content.”16. The Commissioner in her reply has stated that “the Appellant having made clear that he is seeking to probe the result of the inquest in order to identify blame. This necessarily indicates an intent to test or challenge individual’s evidence and is likely to be highly distressing for them”. The Commissioner relies upon examples of the Appellant having stated that: • “he wants to understand the basis of the information used for the case file for the Coronial process”. • “Every recorded incident could be assessed for assurance”. • “Establishing if all relevant information was used to create a fair and balanced process” The Appellant’s case is that he does not want to assign blame “but to conclude with assurance that there is nothing of any concern evident in the information17” 33. Whilst we accept that the Appellant is seeking peace of mind in relation to a devastating family tragedy, we accept that the Commissioner’s interpretation of his comments when taken together is reasonable. In our judgment the sense that the Appellant was considering whether there was a basis to reopen a matter that they were entitled to consider was concluded which would necessitate them confronting their involvement after several years, would be likely to add to any distress associated with disclosure. 34. We have considered whether anonymisation would be appropriate. In relation to witness evidence, the Appellant has the summary as such there would be no purpose in redacting the details of information from any of those individuals. The Appellant argues that he should not be penalised because of his involvement within the case18. However, we are obliged to as s 1(1)(b) DPA requires the Tribunal to have regard to “those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller.” The Tribunal must have regard to the fact that the Appellant and others would be able to go behind redactions relating to these individuals. The Appellant believes that some witnesses were spoken to, notes were made but no formal witness statement taken. Anonymisation would not assist in that situation either as the witnesses could self 14 P5 adjournment submissions 151019 15 P72 16 P34 emphasis added 17 P68 18 P71 11identify or be identified by anyone with them at the time. The Tribunal is satisfied however, that redaction in relation to procedural documents has a qualitative difference in that it would protect the data subject from unwarranted contact and scrutiny unwarranted by their seniority whilst enabling the factual situation relating to process to be disclosed. The balance between the rights and freedoms of the data subjects and the legitimate interests of the public. 35. The Appellant argues that access to the raw data is necessary because: • the summary document provided by the Police to the Coroner is subjective (in that the author has chosen what to include). • The Coroner’s decision of what is important and should be included in the inquest or disclosed under rule 13 is also subjective. • The process of putting notes, and records of initial conversations (radio and telephone calls) into draft and then typed witness statements involves a process of abridgement and subjectivity as to what is material. • The Appellant believes that some witnesses were spoken to, notes were made but no formal witness statement taken. 36. The Appellant views this as critical data because family and friends need raw data to enable them to assess consistency between “raw data” and the “final product” that was provided to the Coroner. He relies upon the example of his wife’s statement which contains less information than conveyed in conversation with the Police. However, he has not detailed anything material that was omitted that would disturb the Coroner’s conclusion, neither has he suggested that she objected to the omissions when she signed her statement. He has stated that he wants to conclude with assurance that there is nothing of any concern evident in the information. We have had regard to the fact that this is a matter that has been through a Police investigation and has been scrutinised by the Coroner. Whilst we recognise the Appellant’s legitimate interest of wishing to obtain closure and peace of mind; we are satisfied that the information that is accessible to him specifically as an interested person under the Coroner’s Rules, addresses the concerns he has raised in this context. 37. We have had regard to the legitimate interest in the public being satisfied that investigations and inquests are reliable, accurate and complete as well as the general need for closure and peace of mind from those who are not interested persons under the Coroners Rules. In our judgment there is no specific concern relating to inquests in general or the conduct of this particular inquest and investigation that overrides the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Similarly, the scrutiny of the investigation through the inquest process and the public nature of the information used at the Inquest in our judgment reduces the weight attached to this legitimate interest. 38. We accept that there is no presumption that openness and transparency should take priority over personal privacy. This Tribunal considers this apparent from the fact 12that disclosure under s40 FOIA can only take place subject to the protections as set out in the DPA 1998. 39. For these reasons and those detailed in the open table below and with reference to the closed material in the closed annex, we are satisfied that it would not be fair to confirm or deny whether Staffordshire Police hold statements relating to the named individuals in the request nor to disclose the majority of the withheld information. We are satisfied that disclosure of certain administrative documents would not be unfair. In relation to these documents alone we have gone on to consider whether their disclosure meets a Schedule 2 condition. Condition 6 Schedule 2 40. The first data protection principle as set out in Part I of Schedule 1 provides that personal data that has been processed fairly and lawfully shall not be processed unless— (a)at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, The relevant condition in Schedule 2 is condition 6 which provides: (1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 41. The Tribunal accepts that in assessing fairness the Tribunal must balance the reasonable expectations of the data subject and the potential consequences of disclosure on the data subject against the legitimate public interest in disclosing the information. In doing so we apply Goldsmith International Business School v The Information Commissioner and Home Office [2014] UKUT 0563 (AAC). 42. In considering the disclosure of the administrative documents identified in the closed schedule we are satisfied that: • the legitimate interest being pursued is transparency and an understanding of the process of investigating and preparing a case for the Coroner. • Disclosure is necessary because it will inform and provide greater detail relating to the process. • Disclosure of the names of the staff involved would be unwarranted due to their lack of seniority and the intrusion that personal contact details would enable. Similarly, personal data of those mentioned in the administrative documentation would be intrusive in its detail and context. • However, in our judgment applying the test of reasonable necessity we have considered alternative measures, and so “a measure would not be necessary if the legitimate aim could be achieved by something less”; accordingly, the measure must be the “least restrictive” means of achieving the legitimate aim in question. In this regard we are satisfied that any prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects can be mitigated so that it is not unwarranted, by redaction. 1343. The Tribunal has considered self identification notwithstanding redaction and any distress caused by association with the event. In relation to personnel their involvement is administrative and thus less distressing than personal involvement. In relation to those who have a personal involvement with the deceased we are satisfied that distress would be limited by the context of the documentation which is reporting the factual process of preparing for the inquest which is a matter of record rather than the detail of the incident itself. For these reasons we are satisfied that condition 6 of schedule 2 is met once the identifying information has been redacted. Health and safety. 44. In relation to the documents to which the Tribunal’s decision in relation to s40 FOIA is that they can be disclosed in redacted form, we have considered whether they should be withheld under s38 FOIA. We have also had regard to documents which contain the deceased’s personal data alone and therefore do not fall within s40 FOIA. 45. S38 FOIA provides that: (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to— (a) endanger the physical or mental health of any individual… This exemption is subject to the balance of public interest pursuant to s2(2)(b) FOIA 46. We accept the Commissioner’s approach19, namely that we must be satisfied that: i. The harm envisaged must relate to the applicable interest described in the exemption. ii. There is a causal relationship between the potential disclosure of the withheld information and the endangerment that the exemption is designed to protect against. iii. The disclosure “would or would be likely” to result in the endangerment alleged, this is lower than the balance of probabilities but there must be a real and significant likelihood of the endangerment occurring to satisfy the requirement. 47. S38 includes endangerment to mental health and is widely drawn. We are satisfied that emotional and psychological wellbeing including the causation of significant distress is included within the ordinary meaning of the term. Staffordshire Police rely upon: • The traumatic nature of any suicide for family, friends, colleagues and witnesses to the incident and the aftermath. • The evidence that staff at the school were traumatised, with one not returning to work for 18 months following the event, and the headmaster’s assessment 2 years after the event that the staff were still fragile. 19 As set out in paragraphs 49-51 Decision Notice and para 24 of their Response 14• The evidence that it was documented that some individuals who were witnesses received counselling. Their case is that disclosure of the withheld information would be likely to cause those affected to revisit the incident, to prevent them from being able to draw a line under the incident and to cause psychological harm and distress. 48. The Tribunal has had regard to the nature of the withheld information. In relation to the administrative documents, whilst they reference the fact of the suicide and the subsequent investigation and inquest they are not detailed or specific in terms of the event or what led up to it. They do not record the involvement of specific individuals or witnesses. As such we are not satisfied that the causal link between the disclosure of these documents in redacted form and the psychological distress alleged would be likely to occur. For this reason, the Tribunal is not satisfied that s38 is engaged with regard to these documents. 49. The Tribunal has considered documents which contain the personal data of the deceased. In assessing these documents, we have looked at the context of the case and the prior knowledge that friends, family and teachers may have had of this information. Although the Appellant points to the distressing nature of information that he was provided with (including diagrams and photos of the scene) we distinguish that from the withheld information in question because the information already disclosed deals with the objective facts which we understand were dealt with in detail at the Inquest. 50. We are satisfied that it would be likely that the psychological impact of seeing the withheld information in question (that would have been personal to the deceased) exposed in the public domain would be likely to cause those who knew her to revisit and reflect upon the incident. In light of the distressing nature of the suicide of a young schoolgirl and the lasting impact that we are satisfied that it had on those involved, we are satisfied that this would be likely to cause distress and psychological harm. We are satisfied therefore that the harm envisaged relates to the applicable interest (namely endangerment of mental health) and that the causal link is evident. In light of the severity of the impact that it had on those who were involved and who knew the deceased (that was still apparent 2 years after the event), that we can be satisfied that it would be likely to result in the endangerment alleged when the request was being considered by Staffordshire Police. 51. We have considered the public interest balance. The Appellant argues that it is in the public interest that the distress to family and friends arising out of unanswered questions and not having access to the withheld information outweighs the likely distressed caused by disclosure. We observe that most of his arguments in this regard relate to the raw data associated with witness statements when what is being considered here is personal data relating to the deceased. Whilst we accept that there is a public interest in transparency and knowing the depth and thoroughness of a Police investigation and scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding such a tragic event, in our judgment this is largely met by the transparency and public scrutiny arising from the Coronial process and the Appellant’s independent rights as an interested person under the Coroners Rules 2013. In our judgment it is outweighed by the public interest in avoiding psychological harm to those affected 15by the incident. For this reason this part of the information should be withheld pursuant to s38 FOIA. Conclusion 52. For the reasons set out above the appeal is allowed in part and the Tribunal is satisfied that the information should be withheld or disclosed as set out in summary in the open table below and in more detail in the closed annex. Type of Reasoning Decision information following the Commissioner’s breakdown20 Witness Although the Appellant has received some Withheld statements statements from the Coroner this was s40(2) pursuant to rule 13 in light of his rights as an interested person NOT under FOIA. Whilst there appears to be no onward restriction as to their use by him, the Tribunal has to consider whether it would disclose them to another person should they be requested under FOIA. We rely upon the expectation that the Coroner and Police perform a gatekeeper role, witnesses should be entitled to expect to move on from a distressing event and the marking of “restricted when complete”. There is insufficient legitimate interest to outweigh the rights of the data subject in light of the scrutiny by the Coroner and the public nature of the Coronial process. Rough drafts, The Appellant has asked for the raw data Withhold notes and behind the witness statements and data s40(2) information which never made it into witness received by statements. The Tribunal does not confirm radio or the extent to which this is held but makes telephone the following general observations. The Tribunal repeats the points relating to witness statements but considers there would be even less expectation of this type of material being disclosed because the witness has not had the opportunity to fact check and agree the information. Making 20 Traffic collision details were a category identified by the Commissioner but plans and photographs have now been disclosed by Staffordshire Police so the tribunal does not consider them here. 16a statement is an agreed process with an element of consent for specified onward use contained within. Disclosure under FOIA of information provided outside of that process would therefore be a greater invasion of privacy. Information There were no charges or criminal Withheld about the driver proceedings. This will have been a s40(2) traumatic incident for the driver, disclosure under FOIA would be invasive and an unwarranted breach of his privacy. Incident Although the Appellant has been provided Withheld summary pack with the witness summaries this, this is s40(2) pursuant to his rights under rule 13 Coroners rules and is not disclosure to the world at large. The Tribunal must consider what it would do if the request were made by a member of the public who was not an interested person. We repeat the points relating to witness statements and rely upon the scrutiny and open Coronial process in satisfying the legitimate interests. Traffic and case Disclose with personal data redacted. Disclose management These are administration documents, as per documents reflecting facts that are of public record closed (e.g. the fact of there being an schedule Investigation and an Inquest). As such they are less distressing (in a way that first hand accounts or a reminder of personal involvement would be) and we are not satisfied that s38 is engaged. The redaction of personal data to enable disclosure would be proportionate due to lack of seniority and protection from intrusion. Communications Disclose with personal data redacted. Disclose re inquest These are administration documents, they as per reflect the fact of there being an closed Investigation and an Inquest as such they schedule are not distressing (in a way that first hand accounts or a reminder of personal involvement would be) and we are not satisfied that s38 is engaged. The redaction of personal data to enable disclosure would be proportionate due to lack of seniority and protection from 17intrusion. Officer Notes The Appellant has asked for the raw data Withhold behind the witness statements and data s40(2) which never made it into witness statements. He includes rough drafts of witness statements, Officer notes and information received by radio or telephone within this heading. The Tribunal does not confirm the extent to which this is held but makes the following general observations The Tribunal repeats the points relating to witness statements but considers there would be even less expectation of this type of material being disclosed because the witness has not had the opportunity to fact check and agree the information. The process of making a statement is an agreed process with an element of consent for specified onward use contained within. Disclosure under FOIA of information provided outside of that process would therefore be a greater invasion of privacy. Information containing As defined in paragraph 20 above. We rely Withhold solely the personal data on paragraphs 50-51 above. s38 of the deceased21 Steps 53.

Farrer Q.C. (Judge) and Tony Stoller and Narendra Makanji -1-Subject matter: Whether The Duchy of Lancaster is a “public authority” for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations, 2004 (“EIR”) Cases: BBC v Sugar [2009] UKHL 9, [2009] 1 WLR 430). Town Investments Ltd v Department of the Environment [1978] AC 359. Network Rail Limited v IC (EA/2006/0061 and EA/2006/0062); Port of London Authority v IC (EA/2006/0083). Duchy of Lancaster Case (1561) 1 Plowd. 212 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision letter dated 29th. May, 2010 and dismisses the appeal. -2-REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction (i) The jurisdiction of the Tribunal 1. .The issue for determination goes to the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner (“the ICO”) hence of the Tribunal. The ICO`s power to issue a decision notice derives from EIR Reg.18 and FOIA s.50 which are founded on a request for information made to a “public authority”. In his Decision letter, the ICO noted that he had no power to issue a decision notice, given his finding that the Duchy was not a “public authority”. He therefore issued a “letter” and indicated that he would not argue against the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, should another party seek to challenge that finding 2. BBC v Sugar [2009] UKHL 9, [2009] 1 WLR 430) dealt with the question whether a “hybrid authority”, that is to say an authority holding information of which a specified category is excluded from the requirements of FOIA s.1 by virtue of s.7(1) and Schedule 1, is, in respect of requests for excluded information, a public authority for the purposes of FOIA, hence whether the IC and the Tribunal were competent to rule as to whether the requested information was excluded from the duty to provide information enacted in s.1. 3. The majority of the House of Lords was of the view that a hybrid authority, listed in FOIA Schedule 1, was a “public authority” for the purposes of a request for information, -3-whether or not the information requested was excluded information. Accordingly, the ICO and the Tribunal had jurisdiction to rule on that issue. 4. EIR reg.18 and FOIA s.50 empower the ICO to decide whether a request to a public authority “has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part 1(of FOIA). The Duchy is not a hybrid authority. Either it is a public authority for the purposes of the EIR or it is not. If it is not, then, on a plain reading of the statute, the ICO has no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint nor the Tribunal to hear a subsequent appeal. 5. However, such a reading ignores the stark practical problems identified by Lord Phillips of Worth Maltravers in Sugar at para. 20 “Under the scheme of the Act an issue as to whether a public authority has complied with the requirements of Schedule 1 falls to be determined initially by the Commissioner, with an appeal to the Tribunal. In a case such as this, that issue turns on whether the information held is public or excluded information. If the Commissioner’s jurisdiction turns on precisely the same question, how is he to set about resolving it if, as is likely to be the case, he lacks the necessary information? Section 51 is designed to enable him to require production of the information that he needs to perform his duties, but that section will not apply if the Commissioner has no jurisdiction. Quite apart from this practical problem, if the Commissioner’s decision goes to his jurisdiction, whether the -4-decision is positive or negative, the appropriate forum for a challenge will be the administrative court in judicial review proceedings. It is hard to believe that Parliament intended that the issue of the capacity in which a hybrid public authority holds information should have to come before a court rather than the Commissioner and the Tribunal, who would seem tailor made to resolve it. In the present case the issue of compliance for the ICO is similarly determined (to a significant degree) by the same considerations as apparently determine his jurisdiction. As in Sugar, the ICO invoked his powers under FOIA s.51 in order to decide whether the Duchy was caught by EIR. He was bound to do so. The result of his research was a finding that the Duchy was not a public authority for EIR purposes. It would indeed be very odd if that finding meant that his research was conducted ultra vires and any requirements to produce material were unlawful.. Moreover, adapting Lord Phillips` words in the final sentence of the cited passage, it is hard to believe that Parliament intended that the question whether an entity was a public authority within FOIA or EIR “should have to come before a court rather than the Commissioner and the Tribunal, who would seem tailor made to resolve it.” 6. If the ICO is competent to make such a finding, what is the position of the Tribunal when the requester or the authority purports to appeal against it ? Its jurisdiction, enacted in s.57, derives from the issue of a decision notice by the IC : - -5-57.—(1) Where a decision notice has been served, the complainant or the public authority may appeal to the Tribunal against the notice. So the question for the Tribunal is whether a decision notice has been served, not whether the Duchy is a public authority. The decision letter labels itself as such because the ICO does not regard himself as having jurisdiction to adjudicate, though he appears to have done just that by the finding that he makes. Lord Phillips, in Sugar at paragraph 37, made clear that a decision notice could be by letter and that no form was prescribed: “Section 50 of the Act does not prescribe the form of a “decision notice"". I consider that this phrase simply describes a letter setting out the Commissioner’s decision”. It seems to us arguable that the letter was a decision notice giving power to entertain an appeal under s.57. Neither the IC nor the Appellant has challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine this appeal and neither the Appellant nor the Duchy questioned the competence of the ICO to rule on the complaint. Accordingly, we have received no argument against assuming jurisdiction. Neither did the Tribunal in Network Rail Limited v ICO (EA/2006/0061 and EA/2006/0062) or Port of London Authority v ICO (EA/2006/0083), though in each of those cases the ICO had decided that the appellant authority was one to which EIR applied. Moreover, those decisions preceded Sugar. 7. The upshot is that the Tribunal decided to entertain this appeal on the ground that there was a plausible argument that it had -6-jurisdiction, notwithstanding the terms of the statute and obvious features on which Sugar could be distinguished. However, it acknowledges that the parties cannot by agreement confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has no power in law to make the relevant decision. We emphasise that this issue has not been argued and our decision is not strong authority for the proposition that this Tribunal has power to adjudicate under s.57 on a decision of the ICO that a body is not a public authority for the purposes of EIR. (ii) The substantive issue for determination As is apparent from the preceding paragraphs, the sole question is whether the Duchy of Lancaster is a public authority to which EIR apply. (iii) The historical background 8 This was undisputed. Indeed, the Appellant relied on particular features of the role and jurisdiction of the Duke and the Chancellor in support of the case which he advanced and which is summarised below. 9 In 1265 the estates of Simon de Montfort were confiscated by Henry 111rd. and granted to Henry`s younger son. The duchy was created in 1351. In 1362 it was conferred by Royal Charter on John of Gaunt, Earl of Lancaster, a son of Edward 111rd. 10 John of Gaunt`s son, Henry Bolingbroke, acceded to the throne as Henry 1Vth. in 1399 upon the deposition of Richard 11nd. -7-Henry ensured the separation of his hereditary family estates from those of the Crown by charter in the same year and his successors maintained that separation in the same way. In 1485, following the wars of the roses, Henry Tudor (Henry V11th.) vested the duchy estates in himself and his heirs by charter as a separate inheritance from the Crown. 11 Therefore, since the fourteenth century, the Duchy estates have been vested in the Sovereign, though as a separate inheritance from the Crown, as recognised in The Duchy of Lancaster Case (1561) 1 Plowd. 212. The Sovereign therefore retains the revenues of the Duchy for her private use. 12 The Chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster has been a member of the cabinet throughout the last century or more. He has occupied a dual role, as steward of the Duchy estates, as to which his duty is to act solely in the interests of those estates and as a political figure, in which role his functions are unrelated to the Duchy. He is appointed by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and receives separate seals of office from the Sovereign in respect of each aspect of his role. 13 Within the Duchy the Chancellor administers “bona vacantia”, that is to say private estates for which there are no successors in title. Outside the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall the Treasury solicitor administers such estates on behalf of the Crown. The right of the Duke to bona vacantia within the Duchy derives from a fourteenth century charter which preceded the accession of Henry 1Vth. It was preserved as a right separate from that of the Crown by subsequent charters. -8-14 The Sovereign, in right of the Duke of Lancaster, appoints to a variety of offices within the Duchy, namely <U+F0B7> the High Shreevalties of Lancashire, Merseyside and Manchester, <U+F0B7> (through the Chancellor) the Stewardship and Barmastership of the Barmote Courts which retain a largely or entirely ceremonial regulatory jurisdiction over mining disputes and offences in Derbyshire, <U+F0B7> the office of High Constable of Lancaster Castle <U+F0B7> judicial appointments to the courts of the County Palatine 1 and <U+F0B7> positions on the Councils of Liverpool and Salford Universities. The Law 15 Regulation 2(2) of the EIR, so far as material to this appeal provides – “Subject to paragraph (3), “public authority” means– (a) government departments; (b) any other public authority as defined in section 3(1) of the Act, ------ (c) any other body or other person, that carries out functions of public administration; or - - - - -“ -9-16 Section 3(1) of FOIA, to which (b) refers, defines “public authority” (1) In this Act “public authority” means— (a) subject to section 4(4), any body which, any other person who, or the holder of any office which— (i) is listed in Schedule 1, or (ii) is designated by order under section 5, or (b) a publicly-owned company as defined by section 6. 17 The Duchy is neither listed in Schedule 1 nor designated by order under s.5. Section 6, so far as material reads :- “(1) A company is a “publicly-owned company” for the purposes of section 3(1)(b) if— (a) it is wholly owned by the Crown, ---- (2) For the purposes of this section— (a) a company is wholly owned by the Crown if it has no members except— (i) Ministers of the Crown, government departments or companies wholly owned by the Crown, or (ii) persons acting on behalf of Ministers of the Crown, government departments or companies wholly owned by the Crown, and ----- (3) In this section— “company” includes any body corporate; 1 Courts exercising a jurisdiction in chancery matters in North West England and dating back to the semi – autonomous regions established in the middle ages to guard the border with Wales. - 10 -18 In s.84 of FOIA, “government department” is, so far as material, defined as including :- “any - - - body or authority exercising statutory functions on behalf of the Crown”. EIR reg.3(3) provides:- “(3) These Regulations shall not apply to any public authority to the extent that it is acting in a judicial or legislative capacity.” The Appellant`s case 19 The Appellant set out his arguments clearly and concisely in his complaint to the ICO, which he incorporated in his Notice of Appeal. He added further points in an email later submitted to the Tribunal in response to the ICO`s Reply. 20 He contends that the Duchy is a “government department” (reg. 2(2)(a)) or, if not, a “publicly- owned company” (FOIA s.3(1)(b)) or, if not, a “body that carries out functions of public administration” (reg. 2(2)(c)). 21 In support of the submission that the Duchy is a government department, he points to the role of the Chancellor as a cabinet minister, in receipt of a salary and answerable to Parliament for the affairs of the Duchy. 22 He contends alternatively that the Duchy is plainly a body corporate, incorporated in 1461, referred to in the Companies - 11 -Act, 2008 hence a company within s.6(3) of FOIA. It is wholly owned by the Crown as its ownership falls within s.6(2)(a)(i). 23 His case is, however, principally founded on the contention that the Duchy is a body “ that carries out functions of public administration” pursuant to EIR reg.2(2)(c). He relies on the role of the Duke or the Chancellor in administering bona vacantia. If he did not perform that function, then it would be fulfilled by a government department, namely the Treasury. 24 He points to a series of public general statutes enacted over the last two centuries concerning the Duchy and argues that their existence indicates that it is not, as the Clerk to the Duchy claims, a private estate. 25 He says that the duty to submit accounts to the Treasury, imposed by the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall (Accounts) Act, 1838 is inconsistent with such a claim. 26 Even if the Duchy is a private estate, that does not exclude the possibility that it is also a public authority for the purposes of the EIR, if it has any of the characteristics set out in the statutory provisions quoted above. 27 The powers to appoint to judicial office, in particular the Vice – Chancellorship of the County Palatine and the Stewardship and Barmastership of the Barmote Courts in Derbyshire is itself a function of public administration. 28 So also are the powers of appointment to the offices of High Sheriff and membership of the university councils. The High Sheriff has duties relating to protection of High Court judges, the - 12 -administration of justice, specifically the issue of high court writs and to parliamentary elections. Those are functions of public administration and so is the antecedent power of appointment. 29 In his Decision Notice and Reply the ICO has drawn heavily on the helpful and scholarly submission of the chief executive and clerk to the council of the Duchy contained in a letter to the ICO dated 3rd. February, 2010. That submission recites the history of the Duchy and its relationship to the Crown, briefly summarised in the introduction to this Decision. It emphasises the separation of the Duchy from the Crown. It analyses the distinct functions of the Chancellor of the Duchy as a political figure on the one hand and as a steward of the assets of the Duchy on the other. It characterises the function relating to bona vacantia as a property right rather than a duty of public administration. It rejects any suggestion that the Duchy fulfils the criteria specified by Lord Nicholls in Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank [2004] 1 AC 546 See below). The Reasons for the Tribunal`s decision. 30 In our judgment, the distinct separation of the Duchy from the Crown, evident from its history, from statute and from the decision in the Duchy of Lancaster Case (1561) 1 Plowd. 212, is of fundamental importance to the determination of the status of the Duchy for EIR purposes. It is a separation which is clearly reflected in the dual appointment and responsibilities of the Chancellor. - 13 -31 We shall deal with the different arguments as to the status of the Duchy as a public authority in the order of the relevant provisions in EIR reg. 2(2). A government department ? 32 Section 84 of FOIA is not expressly incorporated into EIR, which contains no definition of the term. However, neither in its natural meaning nor in the arguably extended sense provided for by s.84, can the Duchy be regarded as a government department. Its only connection with government is that its Chancellor has governmental responsibilities as a result of his appointment by the Prime Minister to that office. They do not extend to the management of the Duchy`s affairs, which is a separate operation undertaken by a chief executive and management committee. The Chancellor is answerable for such matters, not to Parliament but to the Sovereign. 33 If s.84 of FOIA provides the test, namely is it a “body or authority exercising statutory functions on behalf of the Crown”, the answer is : (i) It is a body. (ii) It has no statutory functions, that is functions conferred on it by statute (None was cited ).If it had, they would not be exercised on behalf of the Crown but of the Duke of Lancaster, as is apparent from the summarised history. The Crown means the central executive arm of government – see Town Investments Ltd v Department of the Environment [1978] AC 359. - 14 -So the Duchy is not a government department. A publicly - owned company ? 34 To qualify as a public authority under s.3(1), it must be “wholly owned by the Crown” (FOIA s.6(1)), for which purpose it must have - “no members except— (i) Ministers of the Crown, government departments or companies wholly owned by the Crown, or (ii) persons acting on behalf of Ministers of the Crown, government departments or companies wholly owned by the Crown”, 35 The use of the term “members” clearly envisages a company limited by shares or guarantee, not a corporate body created or recognised by charter. The Duchy simply has no members. It is owned by the Duke of Lancaster, who is also the sovereign. It is not a publicly - owned company. A body that carries out functions of public administration ? 36 The starting point for any determination as to whether a body undertakes public functions at all is the statement of the relevant criteria by Lord Nicholls in Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank [2004] 1 AC 546 at 555 paragraph 12 “12 What, then, is the touchstone to be used in deciding whether a function is public for this purpose? Clearly there is no single - 15 -test of universal application. There cannot be, given the diverse nature of governmental functions and the variety of means by which these functions are discharged today. Factors to be taken into account include the extent to which in carrying out the relevant function the body is publicly funded, or is exercising statutory powers, or is taking the place of central government or local authorities, or is providing a public service.” 37 This test was applied by the Tribunal in Network Rail Limited v IC (EA/2006/0061 and EA/2006/0062) and Port of London Authority v IC (EA/2006/0083). Other factors were considered in those appeals which are not relevant here. Though no single test applies, the absence of some, let alone all of those characteristics must weigh very heavily against a finding that a body undertakes public functions. 38 The Duchy is not publicly funded. It is dependent on the income generated by its estate. The Chancellor receives a publicly – funded salary for his services as a cabinet minister not his duties in relation to the Duchy. 39 We have already determined that the Duchy exercises no statutory powers. Its powers are matters of private law and derive from the series of charters granted in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries. 40 Is it taking the place of central or local government? The principal argument in relation to the functions of central government centres on the role of the Chancellor as to bona - 16 -vacantia. This is, however, not an administrative duty but a residual right to property to which no heir exists, enjoyed elsewhere in the United Kingdom by the Sovereign and exercised by the Treasury on her behalf. The fact that any assets recovered are, with the Duke`s consent, routinely applied for public charitable purposes is immaterial. 41 The offices to which the Duke or the Chancellor appoint are, with the exception of judicial posts in the Palatine Court, largely, if not entirely ceremonial in nature. As to the excepted offices, the power of appointment is a matter of form rather than substance. Judicial appointments are matters for the Judicial Appointments Commission and the Lord Chief Justice. The Chancellor takes no independent decision as to who should be appointed. We observe that EIR reg.3(3) does not assist the Appellant. If, which is doubtful, the role of the Duke or the Chancellor is partly judicial in nature, then EIR is, to that extent, disapplied. It does not follow that the other functions of a body exercising a range of powers are public administrative functions. 42 We further agree with the ICO that the requirement that the Duke of Lancaster consent to legislation relating to the Duchy says nothing as to the nature of his functions. Parliament has legislated so as to require the Sovereign`s consent to enactments affecting her private property and could do likewise in relation to any private property whatever. 43 It is clear that these are not public functions. We do not need, therefore to go on to consider whether they are functions of administration. - 17 -44 The Duchy is not a public authority under any of the tests enacted in EIR reg.2(2). 45 For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. We wish to pay tribute, however, to the care and the precision with which Mr. Cross presented his case, in a difficult area of the law, both to the ICO and to us. 46 Our decision is unanimous.

The appeal is dismissed. 2. The Penalty Notice dated 18 March 2019 is varied, in that the monetary penalty to be paid is £40. REASONS Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is a data controller within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 20181 (“DPA”). As such, it is required to comply with the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 (“the Regulations”)2. As a “tier 1” organisation, the Appellant’s fee was £40. 4. The Appellant failed to provide the Respondent with the information required by regulation 2 (3) of the Regulations or to pay to the Respondent the Data Protection Fee required by regulation 2 (2) of the Regulations by the compliance date of 27 June 2018. 5. The Respondent served a Notice of Intent on 5 December 2018. This contained a typographical error, in that it stated the fixed penalty amount applicable to the Appellant would be £40. In the absence of any representations from the Appellant, served a Penalty Notice on 18 March 2019. This stated the monetary penalty due to be £400. 6. The Appellant has appealed to this Tribunal on the basis that its default was an innocent mistake and asks that the penalty be revoked by the Tribunal. Appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 2 April 2019 relies on grounds that postal reminders and Notice of Intent were not received, although the Penalty Notice was, and it had not received prior warning that the fee was due. 8. The Respondent’s Response dated 24 April 2019 resists the appeal. She submits that the Penalty regime has been established by Parliament and that there is no requirement to issue reminders (although a reminder was fact been sent in this 1 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents 2 The Regulations were made under s. 137 DPA. See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/480/contents/made 2case). It is accepted that the Appellant’s failure to comply with the Regulations was due to an oversight, but it is submitted that the imposition of a Penalty was appropriate in all the circumstances. The Respondent notes that the Appellant had been a data controller prior to the commencement of the Regulations and had paid the relevant fees under the earlier legislation so should have had relevant administrative systems in place. It is submitted that the level of penalty is appropriate. 9. The respondent further notes that the Appellant has since paid the £40 fee. 10. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising 48 pages. The Law 11. The Regulations came into force on 25 May 2018. They replace the previously applicable regulations, made in 2000. Regulation 2 requires a data controller to pay an annual charge to the Information Commissioner (unless their data processing is exempt). It also requires the data controller to supply the Information Commissioner with specified information so that she can determine the relevant charge, based on turnover and staff numbers. 12. A breach of the Regulations is a matter falling under s. 149 (5) of the DPA. Section 155 (1) of the DPA provides that the Information Commissioner may serve a Penalty Notice on a person who breaches their duties under the Regulations. S. 158 of the DPA requires the Information Commissioner to set a fixed penalty for such a breach, which she has done in her publicly-available Regulatory Action Policy3. The specified penalty for a tier 3 organisation which breached regulation 2(2) is £4,000. The statutory maximum penalty is £4,350, which will be appropriate where there are aggravating factors. 13. Schedule 16 to the DPA makes provision as to the procedure for serving Penalty Notices, which includes the service of a Notice of Intent written inviting representations. 14. An appeal against a Penalty Notice is brought under s. 162(1)(d) DPA. S.162(3) DPA provides that “A person who is given a penalty notice or a penalty variation notice may appeal to the Tribunal against the amount of the penalty specified in the notice, whether or not the person appeals against the notice.” 15. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is established by s. 163 DPA, as follows: 3 https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf 3163 Determination of appeals (1) Subsections (2) to (4) apply where a person appeals to the Tribunal under section 162(1) or (3). (2) The Tribunal may review any determination of fact on which the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought was based. (3) If the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice or decision against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice or decision involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that the Commissioner ought to have exercised the discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal or substitute another notice or decision which the Commissioner could have given or made. (4) Otherwise, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal. … 16. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. 17. It is increasingly common for the General Regulatory Chamber to determine appeals against financial penalties imposed by civil regulators. In appeals against Fixed Penalty Notices issued by the Pensions Regulator, tribunal judges have frequently adopted the approach of asking whether a defaulting Appellant has a “reasonable excuse” for their default, notwithstanding the fact that this concept is not expressly referred to in the legislation. This approach was approved by the Upper Tribunal in The Pensions Regulator v Strathmore Medical Practice [2018] UKUT 104 (AAC).4 There is much case law concerning what is and is not a “reasonable excuse” and it is inevitably fact-specific. An oft-cited definition is the one used by the VAT Tribunal (as it then was) in The Clean Car Company v HMRC (LON/90/1381X) as follows: “…the question of whether a particular trader had a reasonable excuse should be judged by the standards of reasonableness which one would expect to be exhibited by a taxpayer who had a responsible attitude to his duties as a taxpayer, but who in other respects shared such attributes of the particular appellant as the tribunal considered relevant to the situation being considered. Thus though such a taxpayer would give a reasonable priority to complying with his duties in regard to tax and would conscientiously seek to ensure that 4 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5acf131ee5274a76be66c11a/MISC_3112_2017-00.pdf 4his returns were accurate and made timeously, his age and experience, his health or the incidence of some particular difficulty or misfortune and, doubtless, many other facts, may all have a bearing on whether, in acting as he did, he acted reasonably and so had a reasonable excuse….” The Facts 18. There appears to be no dispute between the parties as to the facts in this case. The Appellant does not accept that it received an email reminder sent on 7 June 2018, a reminder letter sent on 17 August 2018 or the Notice of Intent. All were sent to the Appellant’s registered office, as was the Penalty Notice. 19. The Appellant expressly accepts that it was in breach of its legal obligations under the Regulations on the relevant date. 20. The Appellant has not provided any evidence of how the obligation to pay the £40 came to be overlooked. 21. The Respondent has provided the Tribunal with copies of the correspondence and Notices that were sent. 22. Conclusion 23. We have considered whether the Appellant has advanced a reasonable excuse for its failure to comply with the Regulations. We conclude that it has not. We conclude that a reasonable data controller would have systems in place to comply with the Regulations and that the Appellant has pointed to no particular difficulty or misfortune which explains its departure from the expected standards of a reasonable data controller. We consider a failure to receive postal reminders not to be a reasonable excuse for such a departure. 24. We have considered whether there is any basis for departing from the Respondent’s policy as to the imposition of a £400 fixed penalty in the circumstances of this case. We note that the Notice of Intent contained a typographical error and that, as a consequence, it stated the fixed penalty amount applicable to the Appellant would be £40. 25. Paragraph 3 (1) (c) of Schedule 16 of the DPA stipulates the contents of a notice of intent as follows: (1) A notice of intent must contain the following information— (a) … (b) … (c) an indication of the amount of the penalty the Commissioner proposes to impose, including any aggravating or mitigating factors that the Commissioner proposes to take into account. 526. In this case the amount indicated by the Respondent was £40. Notwithstanding the Appellant’s assertion that this Notice was not received, we consider that a reasonably assiduous person would have understood from this and from the published guidance that the Respondent had decided to mitigate the level of the penalty. 27. In these circumstances, and having also considered the requirements of paragraph 3 (1) (c) above, we have concluded that the Penalty Notice should be varied, so that it reflects the amount of the penalty proposed by the Respondent in the Notice of Intent. The Penalty Notice is therefore varied to the extent that the penalty due is £40. 28. Having regard to the relevant principles, we note that the Appellant in this case has not presented any evidence of financial hardship and we therefore see no reason to depart from the amended assessment of the appropriate penalty. 29. For all these reasons, the appeal is now dismissed and the Penalty Notice is varied and confirmed. Tribunal Judge Moira Macmillan DATE: 8 October 2019 DATE PROMULGATED:9 October 2019 6"

Dated this 8th. day of February, 2012 Signed: David Farrer Q.C. Judge 3EA/2011/0112 & 0113 Introduction 1. Mr. Nicholas Griffin, now fifty two, has played a prominent role in right – wing politics for many years. As a young man he was a member of the National Front and fought two parliamentary elections as one of its candidates. In 1995 he joined the British National Party (“the BNP”) and became its leader in 1999. He is currently a member of the European Parliament representing North West England, having won his seat in 2009. 2. He professes abandonment of many of the more extreme policies on repatriation of immigrants and holocaust denial, which have characterised these organisations for the last thirty years or so and has sought to give the BNP a more moderate and reasonable image. 3. In the 1990`s Mr. Griffin edited two periodicals which promoted the views of the BNP, “Spearhead” and “The Rune”. 4. In 1998, at Harrow Crown Court, together with an associate, Paul Ballard, he was charged with an offence of publishing material likely to stir up racial hatred, contrary to section 19 of the Public Order Act, 1986. The charge, which he contested but to which Ballard pleaded guilty, related to Issue 12 of the Rune. 5. A police investigation was triggered by a complaint from Alex Carlile Q.C. M.P. as to the content of various issues of “The Rune”. The police conducted searches of Mr. Griffin`s home, offices and other premises under the authority of warrants issued under PACE 1984. Mr. Griffin was interviewed at length under caution by police officers. To raise funds for his defence, he compiled a selection of extracts from the audio tapes of his interviews for sale to the public. At trial he insisted on the full unedited record of those interviews being played to the jury, regardless of relevance to the charge that he faced. He withdrew instructions from counsel who was due to represent him in order to present his case in person. A significant motive for that decision appears to have been the greater freedom to expound his political views and his disapproval of the restrictions on free speech which the statute imposed. It is apparent that he was and is keen to propagate his political beliefs, whenever and wherever the opportunity arises. 4EA/2011/0112 & 0113 6. Mr. Griffin was convicted and received a sentence of nine months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was also fined a substantial sum. Ballard received a similar but shorter sentence. 7. He remains a figure who attracts and welcomes strong public interest, as demonstrated by an appearance on “Question Time” in the recent past. 8. The request for information Mr. Cobain is a respected and experienced investigative journalist, working for the Guardian. He has taken a keen interest in the activities of the right wing organisations in which Mr. Griffin has been prominent and in the development of Mr. Griffin`s political profile. 9. In 2009 Mr. Cobain wished to research the details of the Harrow case, having regard to the stance adopted by Mr. Griffin in recent years as an MEP. It became apparent during the hearing that his interest was, not surprisingly, the political views expressed by Mr. Griffin in “The Rune” and other contemporary publications and subsequently during the police investigation and at his trial. He approached the court for assistance but learned that it no longer held records relating to the trial. 10. On 9th. October, 2009 he made the following request of the Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”) : - “I would like to see all of the papers that the Crown Prosecution Service holds relating to the prosecution during 1997 and 1998 of Nicholas John Griffin (dob 19.03.59). Mr Griffin was successfully prosecuted under the 1986 Public Order Act, with his trial taking place at Harrow Crown Court between April 27th and 30th 1998”. 11. On 29 October 2009 CPS confirmed that it held the information but stated that it was exempt under sections 30(1)(c), 30(2)(a)(ii), 40(2) and 42 of the Act. That position was asserted again following review. It asserted, clearly rightly, that, in so far as the requested information was Mr. Griffin`s personal data, it was his sensitive personal data 12. On 21 January 2010, the Appellant further asked the CPS to provide him with: “... a full schedule of the material that you hold.” 5EA/2011/0112 & 0113 CPS confirmed that it held such a schedule but this request was also refused in reliance on s.40(2). Again, correctly, CPS claimed that it included Mr. Griffin`s personal data. 13. The Complaints to the Information Commissioner (“the ICO”) Mr. Cobain complained to the ICO on 29th. January, 2010. A delay was caused by the mistaken assertion by the CPS of a further exemption and consequent modifications to the request. Suffice it to say that, by early October, 2010, the ICO had resumed the investigation of the request which gives rise to this appeal. 14. The upshot of that investigation was two Decision Notices dated 28th. March, 2011 which upheld, as to everything held by CPS within the scope of the request and as to the request for the schedule, the claim for the absolute exemption provided by s.40(2), on the basis that the information concerned was “sensitive” data within DPA s.2(g)(data as to the commission of an offence). The ICO made no finding as to the further exemptions then relied on. 15. He rightly criticised CPS for claiming the exemptions referred to without reading the documents within the scope of the request and expressed the hope that such a practice would not be repeated. The appeal to the Tribunal 16. Mr. Cobain appealed to the Tribunal on a number of grounds which included the argument that the ICO was wrong to find that none of the grounds set out in Schedules 2 or 3 to DPA were established and that he had misconstrued Schedule 1 paragraph 3 of the Data Protection (Protection of Personal Data) Order, 2000. 17. At a late stage, CPS raised further exemptions under ss. 21, 32 and 44 of FOIA. Of these, only s.32 was maintained to the end of the hearing and that is the only one of the three on which we shall rule. It was clearly an instance of “late reliance”, the explanation for which was set out in a supplementary response of CPS. Following the conclusion of the hearing but before our deliberations, the Court of Appeal decision in Birkett v DEFRA [2011] EWCA Civ 1606 was reported. It decided that a public authority was entitled as of right to assert before the Tribunal a different exception from those relied on in refusing a 6EA/2011/0112 & 0113 request or answering a complaint to the ICO in respect of environmental information. We concluded that the distinction between the provisions of FOIA and EIR, 2004 was immaterial in this context and that we were bound to entertain this exemption, notwithstanding very belated reliance. The interpretation of s.32 proved to be the principal issue of law in this appeal. 18. We observe that the abandonment of any claim to the exemptions under ss. 21 and 44 was plainly right. Neither had any application here. No issues arise under s.42 because the appellant abandoned any request for information to which that exemption might apply. 19. The documentation held by CPS potentially within the scope of this request was very considerable. It ran to six lever arch files. It was clear to the Tribunal from its preliminary reading that only a very small proportion was likely to be of interest to the requester or the public at large. So it proved. Whilst the files contained around two thousand pages, the parties were able to agree that certain documents were beyond the scope of the request because they related to Ballard and a very large number could be described in terms that enabled Mr. Cobain to withdraw his request so far as it related to them. A further group of documents was disclosed. Having seen the entirety of these files, the Tribunal is satisfied that the public interest was in no way prejudiced by these refinements to the original request. It is perhaps unfortunate that they did not take place at the stage of the ICO`s investigation. Whether or not that is so, Mr. Cobain is certainly not to be criticised for failing to narrow his request earlier when he had no clear idea as to what CPS held, due, in large measure, to the refusal of his request for the schedule. 20. A very helpful schedule was prepared on the first day of the appeal which itemised about fifty documents and classes of documents contained in the files, indicating by colour – coding those that were no longer requested and those that had been disclosed. By the stage of final oral submissions, only thirteen of those items remained in issue. In this Decision and in the very short closed annex we adopt the numbering of that schedule to identify the relevant documents. 21. The categories of document So far as they are relevant to this decision, they may be summarised as follows : 7EA/2011/0112 & 0113 (i) Issue 12 of “The Rune”, the source of the charge (Item 8 FOIA ss.30(1)(c) and 32 exemptions claimed. (ii) CPS internal minutes and correspondence (Items 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 26A - ss. 30(1)(c) and s.40(2). (iii) The amended indictment - Item 7 - ss.30(1)(c),32 and 40(2). (iv) The unedited1 record of Mr. Griffin`s police interviews – Item 9 - ss.30(1)(c),32 and 40(2). (v) Material, whether in hard copy or downloaded, which emanated from Mr. Griffin or BNP and which was not obtained or produced as a result of the execution of PACE search warrants – Items 14 and 14B - s.30(1)(c). (vi) Material of that character which was seized in the execution of such warrants – Items 14A, 32B - s.30(1)(c). (vii) Correspondence between Mr. Griffin and CPS referring to how he would conduct his defence – Item 18A - ss.30(1)(c),32 and 40(2). (viii) Any outline of allegations that was not provided in confidence to HM Attorney General – Item 27A - ss.30(1)(c), and 40(2). (xi) Counsel`s annotated opening note2 – Item 38 - ss.30(1)(c),32 and 40(2). (xii) The witness statement and any exhibits produced by the defence witness M. Faurisson – Item 41- ss.30(1)(c),32 and 40(2). 22. The exemptions under ss. 32 and 40(2) are absolute exemptions. No question of the public interest, as such, arises, therefore, in so far as either of those exemptions is engaged, save in the context of the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2000 (see below). S.30(1)(c), on the other hand is a qualified exemption, if engaged, as it clearly is, the balance of public interest must be considered. 1 This refers to the original record without proposed excisions of irrelevant material. This was the record read to the jury. 2 The working note used for opening the case to the jury. 8EA/2011/0112 & 0113 23. Much of the information in categories (i) – (xii) was freely publicised at the trial in 1998. Some, specifically unused material retained by CPS, was not. Where the public interest is engaged (as here where s.30(1)(c) is invoked) it does not by any means automatically follow that such publication in the past determines the question of disclosure today3. Most witnesses are entitled to expect that their exposure to public scrutiny ends with the conclusion of their evidence. Those who make statements do so in the expectation that, if not used at trial, they will not surface later. 24. Nevertheless, standing back for a moment from the application of particular exemptions to the facts of this case, it seemed to us at the outset very odd that in an open society there could be any lawful obstacle to any member of the public obtaining access, for example, to the indictment on which Mr. Griffin was convicted, the records of interviews, which he offered for sale before the trial or the witness statement of a French associate who gave “expert evidence” in support of the political defence which Mr. Griffin chose to mount. 25. Equally, it was soon obvious that a significant amount of material, within the requests, held by CPS was not Mr. Griffin`s personal data at all. There were, for example, periodicals containing articles propagating the views of BNP on a range of issues, for which no party claimed the s.40(2) exemption before us ( see categories (i), (v) and (vi) above). It was clear that the broad and unparticularised approach adopted in the First Decision Notice could not be upheld. The fact that it is information held in a file assembled for the purposes of criminal proceedings against Mr. Griffin (see DPA s.2(g)) does not make it sensitive personal data, unless it is personal data in the first place. Whether some other exemption applied is quite another matter. 26. We turn now to the application of the three exemptions to the information with which we are concerned and our consequent approach to the different classes of information. We deal first with the absolute exemptions, where the sole issue is whether either or both are engaged. 3 See Armstrong v. Information Commissioner, EA/2008/0026, at §§81-86 9EA/2011/0112 & 0113 27. FOIA s.40(2) This was the exemption upheld by the Decision Notices, which is one of the reasons for tackling it first. There was no dispute that the requested information, in so far as it related to Mr. Griffin, was his sensitive personal data. 28. S.40 provides, so far as material: “(2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of data in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene (i) any of the data protection principles,” The data protection principles are found at Part 1 of Schedule 1 to DPA 1999. The first principle, so far as relevant, reads: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.” §6(1) of Sch. 2 provides: “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” The term “sensitive personal data” is defined by s. 2 of the DPA. So far as material, it provides: 10EA/2011/0112 & 0113 “In this Act ‘sensitive personal data’ means personal data consisting of information as to— ... (b) [the data subject’s] political opinions, ... (g) the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, ....” In so far as the requested information consists of Mr. Griffin`s personal data it is therefore sensitive personal data within s.2. That proposition was common ground. 29. So far as relevant Schedule 3 of DPA provides : “5. The information contained in the personal data has been made public as a result of steps deliberately taken by the data subject. 10. The personal data are processed in circumstances specified in an order made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this paragraph.” 30. The Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2000, SI 2000/417 (“the 2000 Order”) was enacted for the purposes of §10 of Sch. 3. By Art. 2 of the 2000 Order, the circumstances specified in any of the paragraphs in the Schedule to the 2000 Order are circumstances in which sensitive personal data may be processed. 31. §3(1) of the Schedule requires that: “The disclosure of personal data— (a) is in the substantial public interest; (b) is in connection with— (i) the commission by any person of any unlawful act (whether alleged or established) (or), (ii) dishonesty, malpractice, or other seriously improper conduct by, or the unfitness or incompetence of, any person (whether alleged or established) . . .. . . , (c) is for the special purposes as defined in section 3 of the Act; and (d) is made with a view to the publication of those data by any person and the data controller reasonably believes that such publication would be in the public interest.” 11EA/2011/0112 & 0113 S. 3 of the DPA provides that the “special purposes” include “the purposes of journalism”. 32. §9 of the Schedule to the 2000 Order provides, so far as material : “The processing— (a) is in the substantial public interest; (b) is necessary for research purposes ...; (c) does not support measures or decisions with respect to any particular data subject otherwise than with the explicit consent of that data subject; and (d) does not cause, nor is likely to cause, substantial damage or substantial distress to the data subject or any other person.” 33. The effect of this labyrinthine series of provisions is to impose the following tests for disclosure in relation to the information in this case, so far as it relates to Mr. Griffin: (a) Would it be fair and lawful ? (b) Is it necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the Appellant ? (c) If the answers to (a) and (b) are “yes”, would the processing be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to Mr.Griffin`s rights and freedoms or legitimate interests ? (d) If it would not, has the information contained in the personal data been made public as a result of steps deliberately taken by Mr. Griffin ? (e) Alternatively to (d), (i) Is it in the substantial public interest? (ii) Is disclosure in connection with the matters specified in §3(1) (i) or (ii) of the Schedule ? (iii) Is it for the purposes of journalism ? (iv) Would it be made with a view to publication, presumably by The Guardian ? (f) Alternatively to (e), assuming (e)(i) is satisfied, (i) Is disclosure necessary for research purposes ? (ii) Would it cause, or be likely to cause, substantial damage or substantial distress to Mr. Griffin or any other person ? ( §9 (c) is clearly inapplicable. ) 12EA/2011/0112 & 0113 34. As regards Mr. Griffin`s sensitive personal data, the CPS largely adopted the position of the ICO as to the application of these tests to this request. 35. As to fairness and lawfulness, the ICO argues that the passage of time is a material factor and the fact that information was placed in the public domain in a court case does not mean that it remains fair to disclose it for an indefinite period thereafter (see Armstrong v. Information Commissioner EA/2008/0026, at §§81-86). We accept those principles as general guidance but note that Mr. Griffin was himself anxious after his trial to publicise his account of it and his claims as to the principles of freedom which, he said, his conviction violated, for example in issues of “Spearhead” in 1998 and evidently in collaborating with other reviews of his trial broadly supportive of his “libertarian” position (see the piece by David Botsford in “Aagh”). Given his marked preference for publicity, not least as to the trial, and his prominent and sensitive political role since, we conclude that disclosure to the world at large of the personal data requested would be fair and lawful. 36. We do not doubt, nor was the point seriously contested, that disclosure is necessary for a legitimate investigative purpose of journalism. Given his position and his own attitude to such publicity, we find no prejudice to Mr. Griffin`s rights and freedoms or legitimate interests. 37. As to the Schedule 3 conditions applicable to sensitive personal data, certain personal data within the scope of the request have been made public, in the view of the Tribunal, as a result of steps deliberately taken by Mr. Griffin. Examples are the account of his views gratuitously4 declared in the course of his evidence and published as described in paragraph 34 and the verbatim record of his police interviews which he chose to sell and to have played in full at his trial so as to publicise his views. To the extent that such material is within the request, §5 of the Schedule to the 2000 Order is satisfied. 38. However, in the Tribunal`s view, a broader justification, which also applies to that material, is to be found in §3(1) of the Schedule to the 2000 Order. Disclosure of the 4 “Gratuitously” since they provided no defence to the charge that he faced but were delivered, it seems, as a public expression of his political philosophy from a platform provided by the criminal justice system. 13EA/2011/0112 & 0113 sensitive data would be “in connection with” the commission of an unlawful act (hence the conviction), seriously improper conduct and arguably Mr. Griffin`s unfitness for political office. It would be for the purpose of journalism, Mr. Cobain`s occupation, and would be intended for publication in his newspaper and possibly thereafter, in a book. Given the issues involved, namely racial and/or religious hatred and the right to express even extreme views, we find that disclosure would be in the substantial public interest. We do not consider that the passage of eleven years before the request renders disclosure unfair, or unwarranted by reason of prejudice to Mr. Griffin`s interests nor likely to cause substantial damage or distress to him. In making that judgement we have regard to Mr. Griffin`s age ( 50 at the date of the request, 39 at the date of trial), his continuing political prominence and his apparent claim to be an educated, reasonable and responsible MEP and party leader who has rejected any racial extremism formerly associated with his party. 39. Subject to the ICO`s argument considered in the next paragraph, at least one condition of Schedule 3 to the DPA, as specified in §3(1) of the Schedule to the 2000 Order, is therefore satisfied. 40. The ICO submits that, notwithstanding the references to particular legitimate interests, research and the concerns of journalism in DPA Schedules 2 and 3 and Schedule 3 to the 2000 Order, s. 40(3)(a) provides an absolute exemption where disclosure to “a member of the public otherwise than under [FOIA]” would contravene any of the data protection principles in Part I of Sch. 1 to the DPA.. Hence these conditions can never be satisfied for the purposes of s.40 since a member of the public will not generally be a journalist, a researcher or have legitimate interests to pursue. Their relevance is confined to the DPA. 41. We do not accept this argument, which was rejected, admittedly obiter, by the UT in All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition v. Information Commissioner [2011] UKUT 153 (AAC) at §113 – 115. We respectfully adopt the UT observation that a requester who fulfils one or more of the schedule conditions is also a member of the public ( and is not the data processor ) who is receiving the information under FOIA. If this were not so, FOIA would be a valueless tool for the serious researcher, journalist, writer, politician or scholar seeking to investigate serious wrongdoing within the 14EA/2011/0112 & 0113 preceding thirty years. If that were the case, it would be reasonable to ask whether FOIA was worth enactment. 42. We conclude that, as to Mr. Griffin`s sensitive personal data and, still more obviously his non – sensitive personal data, s. 40(2) cannot be relied on. 43. There are two examples of the sensitive data of third parties5 which are contained in the CPS files and are within the scope of the request. Different considerations plainly apply. The absolute exemption is rightly claimed in respect of the relevant information and we deal with them in the closed annex. 44. FOIA s.32(1) This exemption was invoked at a late stage by CPS, following, we were told, a change of view as to its proper interpretation. Having regard to Birkett ( see paragraph 17 ) we are bound to consider it. If the CPS is correct, it operates as an absolute exemption in respect of a high proportion of the information at issue. 45. It reads : “(1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it is held only by virtue of being contained in— (a) any document filed with, or otherwise placed in the custody of, a court for the purposes of proceedings in a particular cause or matter, (b) any document served upon, or by, a public authority for the purposes of proceedings in a particular cause or matter, or (c) any document created by— (i) a court, or (ii) a member of the administrative staff of a court, for the purposes of proceedings in a particular cause or matter.” S.32(2) provides : (2) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it is held only by virtue of being contained in— 5 Se item 14B in the table at paragraph 70. 15EA/2011/0112 & 0113 (a) any document placed in the custody of a person conducting an inquiry or arbitration, for the purposes of the inquiry or arbitration; or (b) any document created by a person conducting an inquiry or arbitration, for the purposes of the inquiry or arbitration. 46. The relevant paragraph in this appeal is s.32(1)(a). At first sight the rationale for an absolute exemption to cover such information is the paramount need for the court – and no other party – to control information contained in material lodged with the court for the purposes of litigation proceeding before that court. That suggests that such an exemption would continue for as long as the matter concerned is live, probably until some reasonable time after any appeal is determined or the time for appealing is past. The need for the exemption many years after the relevant proceedings had been determined is not obvious. 47. The Tribunal, when considering the possibly ambiguous drafting of this provision, is clearly bound, in our view, by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Kennedy v ICO [2011] E.M.L.R.24, as to the meaning of s.32(2), since, as that court observed, there is no sensible basis for distinguishing the interpretation of the material words in the two subsections. 48. The appellant, a journalist, requested information that had been filed with the Charities Commission for the purpose of an inquiry into the operation of the Mariam appeal which had been promoted by George Galloway M.P. The inquiry had concluded. The issue for the Tribunal and thereafter on appeal was whether the s.32(2) exemption ended when the inquiry was over or continued for thirty years or so. 49. The Court of Appeal, like Calvert J. and the FTT below, concluded that the critical question of construction was whether the adverbial phrase “for the purposes of the inquiry or arbitration” qualified “held by a public authority” or “placed in the custody of a person conducting an inquiry or arbitration”.6 If the former construction was right then the critical question was : is the information held by the authority for the purposes of the inquiry ? The authority would cease to hold it for the purposes of the inquiry once 6 For the full ruling on this point of construction see paragraphs 15 – 27. 16EA/2011/0112 & 0113 the inquiry had concluded. If the second interpretation was correct, then the exemption continues after the inquiry ends. It concluded that the text was ambiguous. The presence of a comma after “arbitration” suggested that the phrase qualified “held” and a purposive construction pointed in the same direction. However, the removal of the s.32 exemption after 30 years, enacted in FOIA s.63(1) concluded the matter since it would be otiose in all save the rarest of cases, if the exemption lapsed when the proceedings were completed So s.32(2), subject to consideration of ECHR Article 10, maintained the absolute exemption until the court documents became historical records. 50. The Court observed that the same approach must apply to both court and inquiry records. The absence of a corresponding comma in s.32(1) permits the second construction more easily than in s.32(2) anyway. 51. However, the court did not leave the matter there. The appellant had raised for the first time before the Court of Appeal the argument that s.3 of the Human Rights Act, 1998 required the court to read down s.32 so as to take account of the impact of ECHR Article 10. The Court acceded to that submission to the extent of remitting the matter to the Tribunal for the factual issues and arguments relating to Article 10 to be resolved and for the Tribunal to report its findings to the Court of Appeal. 52. This it did in Kennedy v The Charity Commission EA 2008/0083 report to the Court of Appeal 18.11.11. 53. It reported that four questions had to be answered : (i) Does the refusal to disclose the information applying the s.32(2) FOIA exemption interfere with Mr. Kennedy`s right to freedom of expression under Article 10(1) ECHR ? (ii) If yes, is such an interference justified under Article 10(2)? (iii) If no, should s.32(2) be construed in a way which is consistent with Article 10 ? (iv) If yes, does limiting s.32(2) to information held until the termination of the relevant statutory inquiry avoid the breach of Article 10? 54. For our purposes, the critical question is the first, which involves the scope of Article 10. Is it limited to a prohibition on a government from restricting a person from 17EA/2011/0112 & 0113 receiving information that others may be willing to impart to him ? That is the test laid down by the European Court of Human Rights in Leander v Sweden (1987) EHRR 43 and has been followed in a line of Strasbourg authorities cited at paragraphs 25 and 26 of the report. Or does it, on the other hand, confer a right to receive information of general interest, free of unjustified administrative obstacles, where that information is held by an organ of the state, subject to the conditions described in Article 10(2)? 55. In later decisions, namely Tarsasag a Szabadsagjogokert v Hungary (2009) ECHR 618 and Kenedi v Hungary (2009) ECHR 786, both arising from appeals against administrative obstacles to the legitimate gathering of information on matters of general interest imposed by government authorities, the Second Chamber ruled that Article 10 was engaged. One researcher was a member of Parliament, the other a historian. The European Court, like our domestic courts, emphasised the particular importance of the freedom to receive information where the press was concerned. These decisions evidently extended the scope of Article 10 beyond the limits set in Leander by focussing on the right to receive information. 56. In its report the Tribunal concluded that, whilst there was no general right to receive information under Article 10, the scope of the right had broadened since Leander as noted by Lord Judge C.J. in A v Independent News and Media Ltd. EWCA Civ 343 at paras.41 and 42. 57. Having taken account of arguments as to information monopolies and considered the relevance of Mr. Kennedy`s role as an investigative journalist, the Tribunal concluded that the conventional interpretation of s.32(2) was an interference with Mr. Kennedy `s rights7. 58. In doing so it was plainly influenced by the readiness of the Court of Appeal in A v Independent News and Media Ltd to reflect recent developments in Strasbourg jurisprudence. So are we. We adopt with gratitude and respect the very careful reasoning of the report on this issue, which we believe accurately states the law as to Article 10 as recently developed. 7 See paragraphs 11 – 54 of the report for the full review of issue (1) 18EA/2011/0112 & 0113 59. Is that interference justified? We, like the report, have well in mind the relevant principles that the interference must have a legitimate objective, the measures must be rationally connected with that objective, must be no more than necessary to accomplish that objective and must reflect a fair balance between the rights of the individual and society. 60. The first two principles pose no problem. Information lodged with a court, as with a Tribunal, requires a significant degree of protection. 61. Kennedy involved a thirty – year restriction on all information lodged with the inquiry, however trivial or harmless. The report had no difficulty in concluding that it was grossly disproportionate and achieved no reasonable balance of interests. In our judgment, such a restriction on any information lodged with a court and continuing decades after any appeal process is exhausted fails the tests of proportionality by a similar margin. 62. We do not doubt that s.32(1) can be read down in a way which is consistent with Article 10. We consider that limiting the restriction in Article 32(1) so that it ends once a reasonable time has elapsed after the exhaustion or evident abandonment of the available appeal process would avoid a breach of Article 10. S.30 is available as a further safeguard for information which truly requires thirty – year protection. 63. We therefore reject, in relation to any part of the requested information, the reliance on the exemption provided by s.32(1). 64. S.30(1)(c) This is a qualified exemption which is unquestionably engaged, as was s.30(2)(a)(ii) which added nothing in the context of this appeal and was consequently ignored in argument. 65. The Tribunal acknowledges the substantial public interest in many circumstances in protecting from disclosure information gathered for the purposes of a criminal case, 19EA/2011/0112 & 0113 including the need to offer informants and witnesses protection from public exposure and a prosecuting authority a proper space in which to discuss and decide issues that arise. 66. On the other hand, the public has a legitimate interest in criminal investigations and resulting court proceedings, especially where the defendant was a prominent political figure charged with an offence of great current importance in proceedings that he was keen to publicise. The passage of time is also a consideration. Legitimate public interest in such a case continues due to the profile of the defendant but the risk of any impact on the resulting proceedings disappeared long ago. More importantly, the relevant information in this appeal does not include statements from potentially vulnerable witnesses or highly sensitive material. In general, we conclude that the public interest is not shown to favour a refusal to disclose. We have regard to the factors recited in our ruling on s.40(2)(a) as also applicable to the balance of public interest. 67. Though not raised by the parties, we considered the question whether the disclosure of Issue 12 of “The Rune” might be contrary to the public interest in the light of the fact that, on the jury`s verdict, it contained racially inflammatory material. We bear well in mind that disclosure is to the public at large, not just to a responsible journalist. We conclude, however, that this is not a significant factor given that the content of this document has been condemned by the jury`s verdict. No reasonable reader thereafter could properly regard it as a serious or fair contribution to historical research into the holocaust or to any of the other topics of white nationalist concern contained within Issue 12. Moreover, if this view of the public interest prevailed, the public would never be able to judge for itself the standards which the jury in such a case set in reaching its verdict. It might even be an argument for refraining from prosecution at all, since the trial could publicise the offending content. 68. There are, however, three categories of information where we conclude that the exemption under s.30(1)(c) is properly relied on : (i) Material seized by the police from whatever premises in the execution of PACE warrants ; (ii) Internal CPS records which say nothing about Mr. Griffin`s defence. 20EA/2011/0112 & 0113 (iii) Material of such limited public interest that the general interest in privacy prevails though both are slight. 69. Classes (ii) and (iii) are self – explanatory and of very limited application. Class (i) should not be disclosed, in our judgment, because PACE and similar warrants, which are coercive and highly intrusive weapons in the investigator`s armoury, are granted for the exclusive purpose of a criminal investigation and it would be unfair and contrary to principle to require their further disclosure. It is plainly contrary to the public interest for such material to be made available to the public, regardless of its intrinsic character. 70. The application of these rulings to the information still in issue. A spreadsheet was produced and amended, showing the documents which remained the subject of disputed exemptions and the exemptions on which the respondents relied. The scope of that spreadsheet shrank significantly as the hearing proceeded. The general nature of such documents was identified. We shall indicate our decision, in the light of our conclusions as to the application of the three exemptions, by reference to that spreadsheet, omitting all agreed or abandoned items and using the numbering which appeared on the original document. The application of those conclusions to particular items is very briefly stated in the comment column. Unusually, the closed annex to this decision contains only a two references to material which should not be disclosed, having regard to the rights to protection of sensitive personal data of persons other than Mr. Griffin.

Appeal EA/2013/0149 by the Department for Work and Pensions is refused. Appeal EA/2013/0145 is allowed. The Decision Notice FS50460988 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: Department for Work and Pensions Complainant: John SlaterThe Decision Notice dated 12 June 2013 shall stand save that the Public Authority is directed to disclose the risk register (as identified in the Decision Notice) in addition to the other documents referred to. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. This decision relates to three appeals under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) which, having been previously heard together at both first instance and on appeal to the Upper Tribunal, have now been remitted to this Tribunal for a re-hearing. 2. This follows the decision of the Upper Tribunal on 20 July 2015 in cases GIA/2705 and GIA/2721 (“the Upper Tribunal decision”) in which it found that the decision made by a differently constituted panel of this Tribunal on 24 March 2014 (“the First Tribunal Decision”) contained an error of law and that its direction that the Department for Work and Pensions (“the Department”) should disclose three documents should be set aside. 3. The basis of the Tribunal’s decision had been that, although each document fell within the exemption from disclosure set out in FOIA section 36 (2) (prejudice to the conduct of public affairs), the public interest in maintaining that exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. 4. Each of the documents under consideration formed part of the project management tools deployed by the Department in relation to the development of the Universal Credit Programme (sometimes referred to in this decision simply as “the Programme”) as provided for by the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and subordinate legislation made under it. They were: i. The Risk Register maintained by the management of the Programme in the form in which it existed on 14 April 2012 (the date when it was requested); ii. The Issues Register in the form in which it existed on the same date: and iii. A Project Assessment Review prepared by the Major Projects Authority between 7 and 11 November 2011 (“the PAR”). 5. The nature of the three documents, the role they played in the Programme and, indeed, the nature and scope of the Programme itself are explained in detail in the First Tribunal Decision and in the Upper Tribunal decision. Those decisions also contain an explanation the history of the requests for information and theInformation Commissioner’s decisions in respect of them. We need not repeat that information but simply record that, as the matter comes before us, it is agreed between the parties that the exemption under FOIA is engaged and that the only issues we have to decide are the following: a. Whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption claimed under FOIA section 36 in respect of the Risk Register outweighed the public interest in its disclosure. If it does then Mr Slater’s appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision that the Department had been entitled to refuse disclosure will fail. If it does not, his appeal will succeed and a direction for the document’s disclosure will be required. b. Whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption claimed under FOIA section 36 in respect of the Issues Register outweighed the public interest in its disclosure. If it does, then the Department’s appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision in favour of Mr Slater, that it should have been disclosed, will succeed. If it does not then the Department’s appeal will fail and a direction for the document’s disclosure will be required. c. Whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption claimed under FOIA section 36 in respect of the PAR outweighed the public interest in its disclosure. If it does then the Department’s appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision in favour of Mr Collins, that it should have been disclosed will succeed. If it does not then the Department’s appeal will fail and a direction for the document’s disclosure will be required. 6. At the outset of the appeal there was also an issue about whether names of certain individuals should be redacted from any documents that we might order to be disclosed. This was on the basis that publication would breach the privacy rights of those individuals under the Data Protection Act 1998 and therefore fell within the exemption provided by FOIA section 40(2). However, following concessions made during the course of the hearing, the principle underlying that issue was no longer in dispute, although the parties have yet to finalise the list of those affected and any disagreement on that may have to be referred back to the Tribunal for a final determination. 7. Mr Collins opted not to attend the hearing of the Appeals, but relied on his written submissions. All other parties attended the hearing and we are grateful for their assistance. The relevant law 8. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of anumber of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each exemption is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 9. Under FOIA section 10 a public authority must comply with a request for information made under section 1 “promptly and in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt”. If the public authority relies on a qualified exemption it has further time in which to state its reasons for claiming that the public interest balance is in favour of maintaining the exemption (section 17(3)(b)). The statement of reasons must be provided “within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances”. 10. In this case we are also assisted by guidance on the relevant statutory provisions issued by: a. the Upper Tribunal when allowing the appeal against the First Tribunal Decision (which we deal with at paragraphs 43 and 54 below); and b. the decision of Mr Justice Charles, sitting in the Upper Tribunal, in Department of Health v Information Commissioner and Lewis [2015] UKUT 0159 (AAC). 11. In Lewis the Judge considered the application of the public interest balance in the context of the exemption provided under FOIA section 35 (information relating to the formulation/development of government policy). The guidance provided applies with equal effect to the exemption relied on in this case. The Judge, first acknowledged the well-established requirement to adopt a “purposive and liberal approach … to the interpretation and application of FOIA” and the existence of a “strong public interest in the press and the general public having the right, subject to appropriate safeguards, to require public authorities to provide information about their activities” [emphasis in the original]. He then emphasised the importance of carrying out the assessment by reference to the actual harm and benefit likely to follow from the disclosure of the specific content of the requested information in the context of the particular qualified exemption relied upon. The approach, he said, was analogous to that adopted over several years in respect of the balance required where a government department resisted disclosure of documents to its opponent in litigation (thereby potentially undermining the public interest in the administration of justice) on the ground thatdisclosure would harm the nation or the public service (see the summary of the principles of public interest immunity set out in Al Rawi v Security Service [2011] UKSC 34 quoted in paragraph 17 of Lewis). 12. The detailed working through of the “contents approach by reference to actual harm and actual benefit” was then explained in these terms: “26. A classic class claim to PII was based on the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of discussions relating to policy formulation and development. A significant aspect of the reasoning to support that class claim was the “candour argument”, namely the promotion of full and frank expressions of view in robust terms and the thinking and discussion of the unthinkable in order to test and develop ideas. This argument is now advanced under FOIA as a part of the “safe space” and “chilling effect” arguments. 27. The statement to Parliament referred to in Al Rawi abandoned that class approach and so relieved those who were instructed by Government departments of the difficult task of trying to convince courts that it was persuasive. Historically the candour argument was advanced in support of both class and contents claims for PII and LPP. The common law on these issues diverged with the result that LPP is based on a right and so a guarantee of non-disclosure, whereas no such right exists in the context of PII claims or duties of confidence. The lack of a right guaranteeing non-disclosure of information, absent consent, means that that information is at risk of disclosure in the overall public interest (i.e. when the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in non-disclosure). As soon as this qualification is factored into the candour argument (or the relevant parts of the safe space or chilling effect arguments), it is immediately apparent that it highlights a weakness in it. This is because the argument cannot be founded on an expectation that the relevant communications will not be so disclosed. It follows that if he is properly informed, a person taking part in the discussions will appreciate that the greater the public interest in the disclosure of confidential, candid and frank exchanges, the more likely it is that they will be disclosed. In general terms, this weakness in the candour argument was one that the courts found persuasive and it led many judges to the view that claims to PII based on it (i.e. in short that civil servants would be discouraged from expressing views fully, frankly and forcefully in discussions relating to the development of policy) were unconvincing. 28. The same weakness exists in respect of a qualified FOIA exemption because any properly informed person willknow that information held by a public authority is at risk of disclosure in the public interest. 29. Properly drafted certificates and evidence claiming PII addressed this weakness. In my view, evidence or reasoning in support of the safe space or chilling effect argument in respect of a FOIA request that does not address in a properly reasoned, balanced and objective way: i) this weakness, ii) the public interest in there being disclosure of information at an appropriate time that shows that the robust exchanges relied on as being important to good decision making have taken place, and iii) why persons whose views and participation in the relevant discussions would be discouraged from expressing them in promoting good decision making and administration and thereby ensuring that this is demonstrated both internally and when appropriate externally, is flawed. 30. So a contents based assertion of the public interest against disclosure has to show that the actual information is an example of the type of information within the class description of an exemption (e.g. formulation of policy or Ministerial communications or the operation of a Ministerial private office), and why the manner in which disclosure of its contents will cause or give rise to a risk of actual harm to the public interest. It is by this route that: i) the public interest points relating to the class descriptions of the qualified exemptions, and so in maintaining the exemptions, are engaged (e.g. conventions relating to collective responsibility and Law Officers’ advice) and applied to the contents of the information covered by the exemption, and ii) the wide descriptions of (and so the wide reach of) some of the qualified exemptions do not result in information within that description or class that does not in fact engage the reasoning on why disclosure would cause or give rise to risk of actual harm (e.g. anodyne discussion) being treated in the same way as information that does engage that reasoning because of its content (e.g. examples of full and frank exchanges).31. That contents approach will also highlight the timing issues that relate to the safe space argument. The timing issues are different to the candour or chilling effect arguments in that significant aspects of them relate to the likelihood of harm from distracting and counter productive discussion based on disclosure before a decision is made.” 13. Those principles formed the basis for specific guidance to this Tribunal on its approach to evidence and submissions regarding “chilling effect”. It was in these terms: “67 In my view, this points firmly in favour of the conclusion (which I reach) that a high degree of deference to either side is very unlikely to be appropriate when the Information Commissioner or the FTT are assessing the public interest balance under s. 2(2)(b) of FOIA and that they should carry out a thorough and critical analysis of the competing reasoning and analysis and the factors on which they are based. 68. This is in line with many other evidence based assessments of opinion, and involves the decision maker having regard to the expertise of the relevant witnesses or authors of reports: i) in his assessment of the factual base of and the content of the analysis and reasoning advanced for the opinion, and ii) when giving his reasons for reaching his conclusion on matters of risk or opinion (e.g. a court can depart from the views of an expert but must give reasons for doing so and must not develop its own theory against the evidence of an expert – see, for example, A County Council v K, D & L [2005] 1 FLR 851 at paragraphs 58 and 60). 69. At the heart of this approach is a multifaceted assessment by the decision maker, here the FTT (and earlier the Information Commissioner), of the factual bases for and the strength of the rival arguments. This has case and fact specific issues but common themes will be: i) an identification of the relevant facts, ii) a consideration of the relevant factors to be taken into account, and the adequacy of the evidence base for the arguments founding expressions of opinion,iii) a consideration of whether and how the relevant factors have been taken into account in the rival analyses and reasoning, iv) the relevant expertise and responsibilities of those advancing the rival contentions and their impact, v) a judgmental exercise, and vi) the giving of reasons for the conclusion reached which will generally be the best way of demonstrating the approach taken to the issues of degree and thus whether “proper” or “appropriate” weight or “judicious recognition” has been given to the relevant factors .” 70. So, for example: i) in line with my comments on the candour argument if relevant factors are not addressed this will identify flaws in an argument that are likely to detract from the weight to be given to it however experienced or expert the person advancing it may be, and ii) the identification of inaccuracies, overstatements, lack of objectivity and unpersuasive reasoning will have the same effect.” 14. Later in the decision the judge identified certain flaws in the evidence of chilling effect submitted by the Department of Health in the case before him, which he said had justified the FTT’s rejection of it. It contains points of guidance that may apply to other types of case. The relevant paragraph reads: “80 The reasons the FTT give for this conclusion are valid and persuasive. I add that in my view the flaws in the reasoning advanced include a failure to address: i) how the alleged risk of harm fits with the proper performance by Ministers and their officials of their duties (and in the case of the latter the Civil Service Code), ii) whether either of the witnesses or this Minister would act in that way and how they would go about doing this, iii )if as one would expect they would say that they would not why it is said anyone worth his salt would act in such a damaging way,iv) how it fits with the Department’s evidence on the need to provide explanations on disclosure to ensure that a misleading impression is not given and the public is properly informed as to the way in which the Minister is carrying put his duties to further the public interest, and on a pragmatic level v) how the unnecessary steps or engagements are to be identified and thus which faction or factions of the media or public they are to be directed to, and vi) why anyone would take the risks involved in being faced with having to explain this course of action.” The Evidence on Appeal 15. The Tribunal has had the advantage of having been provided with evidence beyond that provided to the Information Commissioner before he issued the Decision Notices from which these Appeals arose. Public documents 16. The evidence included a number of public documents included in the agreed bundles prepared for the hearing, which traced parts of the history of the Universal Credit Programme and public perceptions of its proposed implementation. Those public documents recorded the following events and developments: a. The status of the Programme in March 2011. The Starting Gate Review for the Programme was issued on 8 March 2011 but only came into the public domain when it was placed in the House of Commons Library following the appearance before the Public Accounts Committee of Ian Watmore, a senior IT executive at the Cabinet Office in May 2011. The document assessed the deliverability of the Programme and the achievability of the intended economic outcomes. It concluded that, while the project had got off to an impressively strong start, a demanding timetable had been set for such a complex project and implementation would require co-operation with a number of other bodies. Its overall conclusion was that a high degree of confidence was justified in its ultimate delivery. However, it was less confident about the likely achievement of the intended economic outcomes because of factors beyond the Department’s control and the risks inherent in adopting unproven project management techniques and forecasting the likely response of the intended recipients of Universal Credit. It also drew attention to a number of other risks and made recommendations for addressing them. These includednegative impacts on staff morale, the challenge of imposing a secure internal governance structure and the likelihood of targeting by fraudsters. b. The Department’s prediction for the Programme in November 2011. On 1 November 2011 the Department issued a press release in which it announced that over one million people would be claiming universal credit by April 2014, with 12 million claimants moving onto the new benefit by 2017. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith was quoted as saying that the Programme was “on track and on time”. The press release added that “Many of the technology building blocks needed to deliver Universal Credit already exist with the programme reusing existing, proven IT, which represents about sixty per cent of what is needed. Although there will be elements that need to be updated and parts which need to be built from scratch – Ministers are clear that Universal Credit does not require a major new IT system”. c. The Department’s assessment at April 2012. Its Annual Report and Accounts for the period from April 2011 to March 2012 reported that the Programme had progressed well during that period and that the implementation plan had been agreed in January 2012. d. A commentator’s perception of progress made by September 2012. In that month the BBC issued a news item on the Programme in parallel with a feature on its “World this Weekend” broadcast. It quoted the Local Government Association as having concerns that the IT system would not be ready in time and others as having respect for the motivation for reform but concern about implementation. It quoted a Department spokesperson as saying “Liam Byrne [an opposition spokesperson who had criticised implementation] is quite simply wrong. Universal Credit is on track and on budget. To suggest anything else is incorrect.” e. The House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee perception as at November 2012. The Committee issued a report on implementation of the Programme in November 2012, which included concern about the inadequacy of information provided to it by the Department to demonstrate that information could be passed accurately and quickly between the central government IT systems and those of local authorities. f. The Department’s decision to restructure the Programme in autumn 2012. This included the removal of the programme director and the director of IT and the discontinuance of development of systems for national roll-out in favour of short- term solutions in support of pilot schemes (referred to as”pathfinders”). [This was not public information at the time but was disclosed in the report of the National Audit Office (“NAO”) in September 2013, which is referred to below]. g. The assessment by the Major Projects Authority (“MPA”) in February 2013. This was to the effect that the Department had “…failed to fully implement two-thirds of the recommendations made by internal audit and the Major Projects Authority in 2012.” [The quotation is from the NAO report] h. The fact that between February and May 2013 a team from the MPA conducted a 13-week reset of the Programme. This followed a project assessment which expressed “…serious concerns about the Department having no detailed ‘blueprint’ and transition plan for Universal Credit.” [Again as reported by the NAO, which represented the first public disclosure of the reset] i. The writing off in May 2013 of £34 million. This represented (17%) of its new IT assets. [The source is again the NAO report] j. The assessment of the NAO as at September 2013. The NAO issued the report referred to above. It was entitled “Universal Credit: early progress”. In addition to disclosing the developments described above the NAO identified the following issues: i. It stated that “Throughout the programme the Department has lacked a detailed view of how Universal Credit is meant to work….By mid-2012 this meant that the Department could not agree what security it needed to protect claimant transactions and was unclear about how Universal Credit would integrate with other programmes.” ii. Reviews carried out in mid-2012 had identified that the Department’s decision to ring fence the Programme team had led to “…a ‘fortress’ mentality with the programme team and a ‘good news’ reporting culture.” iii. The Department had failed successfully to address problems with governance and had changed the governance structure on several occasions. iv. Roll out plans were significantly delayed. By July 2013 the roll out of a pathfinder scheme was limited to four sites and involved 1,000 new claims, which were at the most simple end of the range of claims and involved limited IT capability. v. The NAO’s assessment that it was unlikely that Universal Credit would be as simple or cheap to administer as originally intended. vi. The Department’s inability to explain how it had originally decided to commence roll-out in October 2013 in light ofthe late start of its project to develop the necessary IT systems. k. The House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts assessment in November 2013. In that month it issued a report on the Universal Credit Programme which concluded that “… timescales have slipped and that value has not been secured from the £425 million invested so far. There has been a shocking absence of financial and other internal controls and we are not yet convinced that the Department has robust plans to overcome the problems that have impeded progress” l. The most up-to-date official assessment available to us. In November 2015 the Office for Budget Responsibility (“OBR”) issued its report on the Autumn 2015 spending review, which recorded that the rollout schedule for the Universal Credit Programme was around three years late following a number of delays in the previous three years, with 330,000 claimants expected to be receiving universal credit in 2016-17 as against the 6.1 million that had originally been expected. 17. We comment, in passing, that the requests for information in this Appeal were submitted and dealt with around the time of the events recorded at sub paragraphs c. and d. above. Witness statements relied on by the Department 18. As the First Tribunal Decision discloses, the Department relied upon the evidence of Sarah Cox at that stage. However, during the course of this Appeal it filed a further witness statement signed by Cath Hamp, which adopted all of Ms Cox’s evidence and supplemented it with Ms Hamp’s own further evidence. Only Ms Hamp attended the hearing of the Appeal and she answered questions put to her by the other parties to the Appeal and the Tribunal panel, which covered the content of both witness statements. She impressed us with her authority and knowledge and we felt that she gave us honestly held opinions. However, they were too often speculative, rather than based on hard fact, and she appeared at times to be opposed to the concept of transparency inherent in FOIA. 19. Sarah Cox signed her witness statement in December 2013 and, as the First Decision and the Appeal Decision disclose, it formed the main evidence before the Tribunal at that stage. At the time Ms Cox was the Programme Assurance Director for the Universal Credit Programme and had accumulated 25 years’ experience in business planning and programme management.20. Cath Hamp’s witness statement was prepared for the purpose of the remitted appeal. She is currently the Director of Security Design for the Universal Credit Programme having worked as one of its senior managers since November 2012. She had previously worked as a civil servant for 30 years in various management roles, several of which involved fraud/security issues and the management of change. The evidence of Ms Cox, adopted by Ms Hamp and dealt with by her in cross examination 21. Ms Cox outlined the nature of the universal credit reforms and the complex programme designed to implement them, including the operation of the pathfinder scheme affecting only certain categories of claimant in particular areas of the country. In that context Ms Cox explained that the dates when Mr Collins and Mr Slater submitted their information requests (1 March 2012 and 14 April 2012, respectively) fell during a critical stage of policy development, when the enabling legislation was about to pass into law but the regulations required to implement the broad policy statements it contained were still being drafted and detailed implementation plans were being worked on. 22. According to Ms Cox the Department routinely released a great deal of information, both generally and with specific reference to the Universal Credit Programme, and submitted to oversight by the National Audit Office (NAO), the Public Accounts Committee and the Work and Pensions Select Committee. The Department’s supportive approach towards FOIA was demonstrated by the large number of information requests that had been complied with and the relatively few cases on which it had resorted to the investigatory powers of the Information Commissioner, or the appeal processes of this Tribunal. 23. Ms Cox put the information requested into the context of the effective management of a major project, in which each of the requested documents constituted an important management tool designed to identify and manage areas of risk that might prevent or delay successful completion and/or to record progress of interdependent elements. She stressed the importance of those involved in identifying and recording risks being free to apply imagination to identify all areas of potential risks, including outlandish or unlikely ones, and to be free to raise points that might appear to criticise the underlying policy. Thereafter, she explained, each risk had to be assessed, in terms of likelihood and impact, so that actions could be identified, recorded and monitored in order to mitigate each element of risk. Rigorous analysis and structured management was required in respect of matters that develop both from events that may happen (to berecorded in a “risk” register) and those that it becomes clear will happen (to be recorded in an “issues” register). 24. A key part of Ms Cox’s evidence was her concern at the harm she felt might occur if internal programme management documents were, in her terms “routinely disclosed”. Ms Hamp’s adoption of that part of the evidence was at variance with the evidence which both witnesses gave regarding the infrequency with which the Department found itself in dispute over FOIA requests. 25. Ms Cox identified five areas of danger which she perceived as likely to result from an order to disclose the Risk Register or Issues Register. Ms Hamp confirmed in cross examination that she adopted each one as a prejudicial consequence which she considered the Tribunal should adopt as justification for withholding disclosure. 26. Ms Cox’s areas of concern, together with Ms Hamp’s evidence during cross examination on each one, will be dealt with in turn. i. In preparing programme management documents civil servants must be entirely candid; they must “think the unthinkable” and record their thoughts without hesitation or fear of disclosure. They should do so even if this might give an alarming impression to an outsider reading the document without an understanding of its purpose, or provide an opportunity for a hostile journalist or political opponent to make mischief. A perceived risk of disclosure would undermine frankness and candour, leading to the documents becoming bland records prepared with half an eye on how they would be received in the public domain. Ms Cox expressed the view that this would not be evidence of a failure of robustness or courage but simply a reflection of human nature and an understandable reluctance to jeopardise a programme or embarrass those responsible for its implementation. The downplaying of a potential problem could seriously harm a project and much the same result would be likely to occur if truly candid assessments were provided by word of mouth instead of being properly recorded and shared. It was suggested to Ms Hamp in cross examination that civil servants would approach the task of contributing to documents of this nature fully aware of the checks and balances, which are incorporated into the freedom of information regime and designed to avoid premature or inappropriate disclosure. Her response was that the more senior individuals concerned would be aware of this, in general terms, but that more junior individuals, perhaps contributing on a relatively narrow, specialist topic,might not be. She accepted that a disclosure made under FOIA, after due consideration and with time to append appropriate explanation of context and significance, may create a different impact from an unforeseen disclosure, such as an unauthorised leak of information. However, she maintained her view, which she fairly conceded was inevitably based on speculation, that the likely consequences on future behaviour would be similar and that only some, but not all, of those involved would understand that, contrary to the statement made by Ms Cox, the FOIA did not lead to “routine” disclosure. The overall result would be a tendency, certainly among more junior members of the programme team, to write more succinctly when raising an issue and to deal with sensitive material by oral explanation rather than in writing. This would result in less information being available to others responsible for managing the risk and undertaking consequential tasks needed to address the risk. The specific respects in which the documentation might have been less helpfully prepared were considered in closed session and are commented on in the confidential annex to this decision. The annex is to remain confidential until after the deadline for appealing this decision shall have expired or, in the event that an appeal is launched, until after the appeal shall have been determined or withdrawn. ii. Ms Cox’s second point was that premature disclosure would lead to civil servants being distracted from their tasks, in particular the implementation of the project, in order to address concerns raised by outside organisations involved in it (including local authorities) and/or the media. It was suggested to Ms Hamp in cross examination that the task of explaining the correct position to anyone involved in the official or unofficial scrutiny of public affairs was a normal element of a civil servant’s role. Her response was that it was but that FOIA “adds unnecessarily to the volume”. iii. Disclosure of the withheld information would, in Ms Cox view, reveal to the public a misleading impression of progress on the Universal Credit Programme and would not assist public debate. It would, in Ms Hamp’s words during cross examination, put into the public domain the civil servants “worry list”, which would create an unnecessarily negative impression which did not reflect the truth about the project’s progress. iv. Allied to the previous point, Ms Cox considered that disclosure could lead to sensationalist, rather than responsible and balanced reporting, which would further contribute to the public acquiring a misleading impression.Ms Hamp expressed the view under cross examination that, even though several of the risks identified in the withheld information would be seen to be routine and unsurprising, some of the content would be likely to lead to distorted headlines. Her attention was drawn to the newspaper article which had followed the voluntary release of the March 2011 Starting Gateway Review (see paragraph 16 a. above). This was a Daily Telegraph article dated 26 September 2011. She accepted that it was a reasonably bland and high level summary although she took issue with its headline “Secret report reveals ‘real danger’ to welfare reform”, which she felt was not balanced by the overall conclusion of the article that “Overall, the MPA’s “Starting Gate” assessment is that DWP and HMRC are able to deliver Universal Credit”. Ms Hamp also expressed the view that the article would have been more vivid had the report itself been more critical of progress and planning up to that time. v. The fifth concern expressed by Ms Cox, and adopted by Ms Hamp, was that disclosure would have a negative impact on local authorities and other organisations who were co- operating with the Department. A particular concern for local authorities has been the potential impact on Housing Benefit staff whose jobs will be lost when Universal Credit is fully implemented. Ms Cox thought that such authorities would be dismayed if the detail of the risks they faced were to be disclosed. Ms Hamp was challenged in cross examination to explain how the disclosure of material identifying this as a risk could trouble authorities who would be familiar, already, with the impact Universal Credit would have on local human resource issues. She expressed the view that local authority employees, below those senior officials who she conceded would already have “got a feel for” the consequences, might be shocked at how far forward and detailed the planning was. Their managers might have preferred to maintain more control over the release of the information to the public. vi. Ms Cox’s final point of concern was that those writing reports would be inclined to write at more length, in order to include explanations and caveats, which would detract from the value of the document as a “short and punchy” commentary. In this respect Ms Hamp’s concern seemed to be that the documents would become more concise, rather than less, and she fairly acknowledged that there was a discrepancy between herself and her colleague in this respect and that they were both basing their assessment on an educated guess or hunch.27. Although Project Assessment Reviews carried out by the Major Projects Authority perform a different function to the two registers previously considered, Ms Cox nevertheless considered that the disclosure of the PAR in response to Mr Collins’ information request dated 1 March 2012 would lead to difficulties. She explained that a PAR was typically used to review only the most major projects, which require bespoke terms of reference and involve in-depth investigation by an independent and appropriately skilled team of individuals. Their task is to review the project over a relatively short period of time (in this case it lasted from 7-11 November 2011), adopting a challenging approach in order to explore key risks and issues. This will involve interviewing staff on a non-attributable basis in order to encourage full and frank discussion. The report generated during the review is expected to be shared by those managing the project with the individuals, whether within the department or outside, who have responsibility for its ultimate delivery. The tone set during the review and the manner in which the final report is distributed within the team, but not beyond it, is designed to ensure that the outcome and recommendations are supported by the project team. 28. Ms Cox accepted in her witness statement that most members of the team would know each other’s views well enough and that they would therefore know the source of particular views recorded in the report. They would also understand that others would recognise their own view, as recorded in the report, even without direct attribution. Ms Hamp considered that there might still be a degree of speculation about the source of particular comments, if the report were to be disclosed, and that this might affect how an individual would respond to an interviewer. However, her own direct experience of “calling out” an issue, in circumstances where it would have been apparent to the rest of the team that it was she who had done so, suggested that trust and cooperation are not necessarily undermined. Ms Cox thought that there might also be an impact on the drafting of a PAR, with findings more heavily qualified and recommendations expressed in less clear and frank language, if those preparing them considered that it might be published prematurely. 29. Ms Cox concluded her witness statement with a description of the manner in which the particular documents under consideration in this Appeal were created and the role they played in risk assessment and project management. She drew particular attention to the fact that the Risk Register and Issues Register was each an iterative document, which was being updated on an almost daily basis as steps were taken to ameliorate identified risks or assess new ones. If it had been disclosed in response to the original request, therefore, there would have been no time to undertake, and record, steps to manage any risk that had beenidentified and introduced into the document during the days immediately preceding the information request. In the case of the PAR, the request had been received just four months after it had been prepared, at a point in time when it was the most up-to-date report available for the Programme and when some of the recommended actions were not yet due for completion. The same concerns about the “chilling effect” of premature disclosure and the need for “safe space” to deal with recommendations therefore applied as for the other documents. 30. In order to address the questions that arose in relation to the First Tribunal Decision regarding the leak of the Starting Gate Review and the impact that might have on civil servants’ approach to project management records, Ms Hamp described the difference between a Starting Gate Review and a PAR. The former assesses the deliverability of a new policy or business change initiative prior to public commitment to it and is designed to help in identifying practical delivery issues from the outset. It therefore addresses the project at a high level of generality on the basis of circumstances at the time which are likely to change as the project develops. By contrast a PAR is a “deep dive”, which takes place during the lifetime of a project and examines specific issues in detail and over a short period of time. A major project is likely to be the subject of several PAR reports and may have to address sensitive topics such as finances, resources, commercial arrangements and the way in which those responsible for delivering the project are performing their roles. The open witness statement of Ms Hamp 31. In addition to supporting Ms Cox’s evidence on the likely harm of an FOIA disclosure, as described above, Ms Hamp’s witness statement included additional concerns of her own. She conceded that, because the FOIA regime does not lead to many cases of sensitive information being released prematurely, the effect of disclosure has to be inferred from other types of disclosure in the context of known departmental behaviour and culture. She also explained why the Department’s recent decision to disclose a previously withheld Milestone Schedule in respect of the Universal Credit Programme was not expected to have the same damaging effect on civil servant candour as the disclosure of the information in dispute in this Appeal. She nevertheless thought that it was possible that future milestone schedules might contain vaguely labelled milestones and deadlines that were unrealistically long as a perceived protection against future public examination, but described this as a “minor chilling effect” which was likely to be detected by the robust systems the Department has in place.32. Ms Hamp was asked if she was aware of the outcome of each of the cases in which disclosure of similar information has been ordered in the past. These were: a. an order to disclose a gateway report on a project to introduce identity cards – FTT decision in OGC v Information Commissioner EA/2006/0068; b. an order to disclose risk and issues registers on a badger cull project – UT decision in Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs 2014 UKUT 0526; and c. the release of a project assessment review in respect of HS2 following the government’s withdrawal from judicial review proceedings challenging its veto of a direction for disclosure). She confirmed that she was not aware of any resulting difference in the behaviour of civil servants and, indeed, was only aware, in general terms, of the fact that the disclosures had been made. 33. Against that background Ms Hamp looked at the consequences of information having been leaked as the closest comparable circumstance to a FOIA disclosure. She did, however, concede, both in her witness statement and during cross examination that an FOIA disclosure can be planned for and managed in a way that an unauthorised leak cannot. 34. A particular leak was the release to the Daily Telegraph of the Starting Gate Review referred to in paragraph 26 iv. above. Ms Hamp said that the leak made DWP officials feel more defensive and built a sense of being “under siege”, leading to the imposition of security measures that had the effect of undermining efficient working. She made the point in her witness statement that these effects flowed from the release of a document that was significantly less sensitive than the information under consideration in this Appeal. In cross examination she conceded that these events had taken place before she joined the programme and explained that the consequences had been explained to her as part of the induction process in November 2012. She also accepted that the Daily Telegraph report was one of several factors occurring between late 2011 and the autumn of 2012, covered in her witness statement, which had contributed to the difficulties that the programme team faced at the time and that it would not be appropriate to consider the leak in isolation. 35. It was put to Ms Hamp in cross examination that it was surprising that the consequences she identified as flowing from this particular leak did not seem to have been identified by either MsCox, in her witness statement, or the Department’s representatives who prepared written submissions to the Information Commissioner during his investigation. This, it was suggested, indicated that the consequences of the leak which Ms Hamp had described were not as significant as she claimed. In response, Ms Hamp pointed out that Ms Cox had joined the programme later than she had, but she did not otherwise wish to add to what she had said. 36. Ms Hamp also made clear during cross examination that she considered that the PAR under consideration in this Appeal had not been intended for public disclosure at the time when it was written. In further clarification of that statement, she made it clear that she meant that the intention would have been that it would never be disclosed, even after having been superseded by the PAR emerging from a later review, such as the one that took place in May 2012. She did not think that its disclosure, or the disclosure of the other documents under consideration, would provide significant assistance to those seeking where the truth might lie between scare stories in the media about the Universal Credit Programme’s progress, on the one hand, and optimistic public statements by politicians and others, on the other. The public would be adequately informed by the answers given to Parliamentary questions and information emerging from the Public Accounts Committee and the Work and Pensions Select Committee. Ms Hamp’s attention was drawn in cross examination to a document published by the MPA in March 2012 entitled “MPA Guidance for Departments”. It included a section on the confidentiality of project assessment reviews, which included the following guidance: “Information about or for a PAR review, or in a PAR report, will be subject to the FOI Act 2000 and to the Environmental Information Regulations (EIRs) of 2004. SROs are responsible for compliance with requirements under the Government’s transparency agenda to publis information in PAR reports, and for making decisions on prior redaction related to commercial, policy, personal data or other sensitivities justifiable under the FOI Act 2000 Decisions on FOI requests made to the Cabinet Office or to the MAP for disclosure of PAR information will be taken on a case-by-case basis…” The document was put to Ms Hamp in cross examination but she did not express a view as to whether it was likely to operate as notice to all those involved in a project assessment review of the possibility of disclosure if the Information Commissioner (or this Tribunal) made a direction to that effect.37. In 2013 a report based on a review of the morale of staff working on the Universal Credit Programme was prepared for the Department. It was leaked and Ms Hamp stated in her witness statement that this led to reduced trust between individuals and a reluctance to share comments that might be interpreted as critical of the Programme. At senior management level it led to the imposition of stringent security measures, which further undermined efficient communication between those working on it. 38. Ms Hamp was taken during cross examination to the NAO report of September 2013 As previously recorded it included a review of events occurring across the time covered by the information requests submitted by Mr Slater and Mr Collins. Ms Hamp accepted, by reference to several of the specific issues highlighted by the NAO, that the report was critical of the Programme’s progress and had recorded just how serious the problems were that led to the decision to reset it in early 2013. She was invited, in particular, to comment on criticism that the Department had not established how systems and processes were intended to fit together and how they related to the objectives set for Universal Credit – problems that were said to have persisted despite having been raised repeatedly in 2012 by internal audit, the MPA and a supplier-led review. It was also reported that most of the recommendations emerging from the November 2011 PAR had been implemented by April 2012 but that implementation declined significantly after that date and that by January 2013 the Department had failed to implement 67% of recommendations made in 2012. It was accepted by Ms Hamp that it was not possible to control the release to the public of any information that was thought to be critical of the Programme’s progress because the true position would ultimately emerge from NAO reports. She also did not dispute that, by contrast with the NAO’s criticisms, the impression conveyed by official statements and press releases at the time was more optimistic than appeared to have been justified. These included the press release of 1 November 2011 (paragraph 16 b. above) and the statement to the BBC by a Department spokesperson in September 2012 (paragraph 16 d. above). It was put to Ms Hamp that it could be seen in retrospect that hostile media headlines had been fully justified and that the disclosure of the withheld information would have given the public a more balanced picture than it could obtain from the Department’s optimistic public statements at the time. Her response was that she did not disagree with that statement. The closed witness statement of Ms Hamp39. The First Decision included a confidential annex in which the Tribunal considered the persuasiveness of a separate, closed witness statement which Ms Cox had signed. There is no equivalent closed witness statement from Ms Hamp in this Appeal. However, she did say, in response to some of the questions put to her in cross examination, that it would be easier to illustrate her concerns by reference to particular parts of the documents under consideration, rather than in vague general terms. The passages to which she referred were then investigated during a closed cross examination session. The detailed outcome of that session is summarised in the confidential annex to this decision. The submissions of the parties 40. It is common ground between the parties, based on the authoritative statement on the topic in APPGER v Information Commissioner and Foreign and Commonwealth Office [2015] UKUT 0377 (AAC), that the moment in time at which competing public interests for and against disclosure are to be assessed is the date of the Department’s refusal of each of the original information requests. Applying that rule to this case: a. In the case of Mr Collins’ request: i. The information requested (the PAR) had come into existence during the period of 7-11 November 2011; ii. The request was submitted a little under four months later, on 1 March 2012; and iii. The Department’s determinative refusal, following internal review of its initial reaction, was communicated on 14 May 2012, six months after the PAR had been created. b. In the case of Mr Slater’s request: i. The information in the Risk Register and Issues Register was being developed up to the date of the request; ii. The request itself was submitted on 14 April 2012; and iii. The Department’s determinative refusal, following internal review of its initial reaction, was communicated four months later, on 10 August 2012 41. It was also common ground that we should not base our decision on the reaction to the risk of disclosure that we think civil servants should have but to what it is likely they would have. 42. Although our attention was drawn to earlier cases in which orders have been made for the disclosure of broadly equivalent information about government projects, none of the parties suggested that we should decide this case by analogy or on any basis other than our own assessment of the public interest factors applying in respect of the particular information requested and particular circumstances applying at the relevant time. Ourattention was, however, drawn to the evidence of Ms Hamp 32 in which she had not been able to identify any change in approach following previous disclosures. 43. All parties also acknowledged, if they did not all rely on, the guidance provided by the Upper Tribunal when allowing the Department’s appeal from the First Tribunal Decision. This was that it was an error of law to place weight on the fact that no evidence had been adduced to demonstrate that the approach of civil servants to document creation had changed since disclosure requirements first arose under the FOIA in January 2005. 44. There was also agreement on all sides that the Universal Credit Programme constitutes a major reform, which involves severe challenges in implementation and may have very significant impact on the lives of potential recipients. However the arguments varied as to the impact of that assessment on the balance of public interest. The Department, while acknowledging the public interest in being equipped to understand and debate issues arising from the Programme, urged us to conclude that no disclosure should be ordered that might undermine the effectiveness of the project management of such an important reform programme. The other parties relied on the size, complexity and importance of the Programme to stress the importance of the public being able to assess whether the implementation of the policy (but not, obviously, its earlier adoption) was capable of being completed and whether the steps being taken in that direction were effective. 45. The Information Commissioner also highlighted the contrast between government statements suggesting that the project was on time and on budget, on the one hand, and subsequent judgments by others that it had in effect been through a very troubled period. The NAO report in September 2013 was one example of this. 46. A further public interest factor in favour of disclosure presented to us by the Information Commissioner was the light it would shine on the effectiveness of the Major Projects Authority, which had been created in March 2011 as the means by which the 2010 coalition government planned to improve government’s record of delivering projects. He drew attention to a statement made by the Cabinet Office Minister, Francis Maude MP, in May 2013 which included this passage: “By their very nature [major projects] are high risk and innovative. They often break new ground and dwarf anything the private sector does in both scale and complexity. They will not always run to plan. Public scrutiny, however uncomfortable, will bring aboutimprovement. Ending the lamentable record of failure to deliver these projects is our priority.” The Information Commissioner argued that this demonstrated the public interest in seeing the PAR and that it would not have been premature to have released it in May 2012, which was six months after the review had been completed and around the time when the MPA carried out a further PAR, rendering the previous one historic. He relied on the NAO’s assessment that up to April 2012 the Department had implemented the majority of the recommendations from the PAR but that its record in that respect grew significantly worse over the following nine months. This, he argued, emphasised the importance of the public being made aware of the approach and effectiveness of the MPA around the time when the information requests were rejected, instead of having to wait for over a year to discover the truth about this and the difficulties the Programme team were facing. 47. The Department argued that if either or both of the registers were to be prematurely disclosed, or if civil servants were to fear that this would be the case, the purpose of providing short and punchy summaries of risk or problems would be undermined because they would come to be written in bland terms as a result of the writer having an eye on how they would be received in the public domain. Disclosure would also deny those engaged on a major government project the necessary safe space in which to deal with issues away from the glare of publicity. Each register is an iterative document which records both the identification of a risk or issue and the subsequent steps planned or taken to manage or mitigate it. Disclosure at a stage when there may have been little or no time to explore solutions would lead to unhelpful media intrusion and unnecessary public alarm. That in turn could lead to resources being diverted in order to address misunderstandings that may have arisen among both the public at large and the delivery partners with which the Department has to work. 48. We were expressly invited by the Department to consider each of the issues raised by reference to the closed evidence which we had received. In particular we were invited to place due weight on the evidence provided by Ms Hamp, in light of her seniority and experience and the helpful and candid manner in which she had answered questions. We were invited to accept that, although inevitably speculative, it was based on the witness’s extensive experience. 49. In respect of the PAR the Department again stressed the need for it to be written in frank and candid terms. It was equally important that those interviewed should candidly express their personal views and experiences and should not feel constrained by the fear of being publicly identified as the source of criticism or concern.Those individuals should also be able to place trust in the review process as they would be the ones required to implement any recommendations arising from the PAR. That would only happen, it was argued, if they accepted the fairness and rigour of the review, including the way in which their own views had been received. Premature disclosure would undermine the process and lead to team solidarity and personal loyalties (to the project or to one or more individuals) coming in the way of frank and honest commentary, thereby reducing the robustness of the PAR process. It would also lead to the reviewers themselves adopting a more defensive approach to drafting, with a disproportionate focus on presentational concerns. 50. Those factors had particular impact, it was said, because the information request had been received less than 4 months after the PAR had been completed and before the expiration of the time set for taking particular remedial steps. Disclosure would therefore have exacerbated the problems faced in managing public expectations in the face of the hostility and criticism which the Programme was said to have attracted at the time. 51. In both argument and evidence the Department’s representatives urged us to accept that the anticipated change in civil servant approach should not be regarded as discreditable, let alone a breach of the Civil Service Code, but just the understandable reaction that any person would have in the face of a risk of public exposure. There was, for example, no question of civil servants failing to identify risks or problems – they would still do so, but in terms that made their contribution less valuable to the process of project management. The reaction to unauthorised disclosures in the past, as described by Ms Hamp in her witness statement, was proposed as a parallel and an indication of the reaction that might have been expected had the information requests been complied with. 52. The Department’s detailed arguments on the public interest in disclosure (touched on in paragraph 44 above) were that it was likely to be focused more on the wisdom of having adopted the underlying policy than on the detailed process for delivering it. To the extent that there was a legitimate public interest in management issues it was adequately served by other means, such as the inspection and public reporting by the NAO, the Public Accounts Select Committee and Work and Pensions Committee of the House of Commons. In this respect the Department suggested that the problems, identified in the course of such public investigation and relating to an apparent “fortress mentality” within the Programme team, would be exacerbated by premature public disclosure of key elements of the Department’s internal project management processes. It would lead to the understandable human reaction to lean towards optimism inpreparing any materials that may be published, particularly in the case of a record affecting a project that has attracting what the Department considered to be particularly vehement, and in some cases unfair, criticism. Particular reliance was placed, in this respect, on Ms Hamp’s evidence regarding the extent to which this increased the pressure under which the project team worked. 53. Our attention was also drawn by the Department to the following paragraph of the Upper Tribunal’s decision allowing the appeal against the First Tribunal Decision: “21. There is one factor that troubles me about the tribunal’s reasoning, although it is not necessary to decide whether this involved an error of law. The tribunal’s reasoning show no recognition of the trouble that can be caused by the media taking a selective approach to what it publishes and putting its own spin on that material. The tribunal’s reasons seem to assume a rational and objective media operating as a responsible overseer on behalf of the public. No doubt, some of the media do behave in that way, but some do not. It is not difficult, looking at the Risk Register, to see how a journalist or blogger with an agenda could select and present parts of the material in a way that would generate attention and attract criticism of the Department. To take an example at a fairly general level, the officials may have identified a possible, difficult problem that requires a lot of action, which is itemised in the register. Objectively, that might seem responsible conduct. But to someone with a different point of view, it could easily be presented as evidence of a project that is in trouble, or as evidence of waste of public funds on a flawed project. This could generate media attention, which would in turn require a response from ministers, leading to the sort of disruption of normal business that Ms Cox explained in her witness statement. I mention this merely as a warning to tribunals that they should take account of the realities of how some sections of the media work and of the impact this can have. 22. The tribunal did discuss the public relations handling of the project. But again the discussion seems to assume that problems can be anticipated and planned for. That is certainly true of some problems, but not of all. There is no limit to the ways in which seemingly innocuous details can be used as a means of causing trouble.” 54. We were invited to regard the quoted passage as persuasive (it was certainly not put to us as binding authority) in terms of considering, within the broad spectrum of print, broadcast and online media, the reaction that anyone might be expected to have to the sort of commentary which publication might be expected to generate. The Information Commissioner’s position on the relevance of, and weight to be applied to, the Upper Tribunalguidance was broadly the same – media reaction was a factor that we should take into account when assessing the harm likely to follow from disclosure. We should therefore take it into account and form our own view as to its significance, bearing in mind that those involved would also know that the manner in which they performed the project management functions would be likely to be reviewed, also, by the NAO and relevant Parliamentary Committees. 55. The Information Commissioner also referred us to the binding authority in Lewis and stressed the importance of making our assessment on the basis of the content of the documents under consideration, and not the general class of document in which they each fell, and with an eye to the known risk of FOIA disclosure which members of the Programme team must be assumed to have acquired at the time when the documents under consideration were created (see the passages of Lewis quoted in paragraphs 12 and 13 above). It was also suggested to us that the issues mentioned in paragraph 80 of the Lewis decision, (quoted in paragraph 14 above), while based on the particular facts of that case, were nevertheless illustrative of the factors we should take into account when reviewing the evidence presented to us. 56. Against that background the Information Commissioner invited us to reject the evidence of Ms Cox as to the behavioural changes she feared, as well as the additional evidence of Ms Hamp regarding what he characterised as the quite different form of disclosure resulting from unauthorised leaks. He also suggested that any risk of misunderstanding resulting from disclosure was overstated and could, in any event, have been dealt with by a clarifying statement, which would not impose any significant burden on Department staff, in terms of its preparation and dissemination. This, he argued, had been demonstrated by the manner in which the Department managed the release of, for example, the NAO report. 57. The Information Commissioner had originally decided (in his decision notice in Slater) that the Risk Register should not be disclosed. However he changed his mind, having seen the evidence of Ms Cox tested during the previous tribunal hearing and considered the arguments set out in the First Tribunal Decision. He therefore no longer opposed Mr Slater’s appeal. He argued that the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure in respect of that information any more than it did in respect of the Issues Register and the PAR. 58. Mr Slater emphasised the importance of disclosure by reference to his own concern, as a consultant in his own right, thatgovernment statements in 2011 seemed to take an approach to such a major project, which was both simplistic and over- optimistic. This was a view, he said, which had been proved to have been justified when, eventually, information was released about the difficulties which the Programme faced and which had been openly accepted in Ms Hamp’s evidence. He also argued that suggestions that the public would misunderstand the requested information were patronising and underestimated the public’s ability to understand that project risks need to be anticipated and to expect that a thorough risk management exercise would be undertaken and ought to include imaginative speculation about matters that could conceivably undermine progress. Our decision on the public interest balance 59. We have reviewed the disputed information in the closed bundles provided to us and have reached our decision on the basis of our perception of the harm likely to flow from disclosure of the particular information that each document contains, balanced against the benefit likely to follow from disclosure. 60. We have carried out that exercise by reference to the dates on which the Department notified the respective requester of its decision, on internal review, to refuse disclosure. The relevant dates are set out in paragraph 40 above. The period of time between request and possible disclosure is therefore six months in the case of the PAR and four months in the case of the two Registers. This is on the basis that the iteration of the relevant register would have been the one existing at the time of the information request. However, there would have been nothing to prevent the Department, if it had been minded to make disclosure, adding an explanation of steps taken during the intervening months to address the identified risks, particularly if one or more of them might have been misunderstood. 61. Although it is conceivable that a hostile press might concentrate on the apparently alarming risk identification and might ignore the explanation, the evidence before us suggests that, on this issue, the media has adopted a relatively balanced approach to information about the Programme that has come into its possession. Ms Hamp’s evidence on the issue was decidedly muted, even though the examples of disclosure on which she relied arose from unauthorised leaks, which are more likely to attract headlines and are more difficult to manage. It is, in any event, a perfectly appropriate performance of the media’s role in a modern democracy for it to investigate and comment on the implementation of a major reform involving large sums of public money and a potentially crucial impact on the lives of some of the least fortunate members of society. We do not therefore acceptthe Department’s submissions on the likelihood of the public misunderstanding the disputed information, or being misled as to its significance by the media. On the facts of this case disclosure might have corrected a false impression, derived from official government statements by revealing the very considerable difficulties that were beginning to develop around the time when the information requests were submitted. 62. Nor do we accept that resources would be wasted in providing explanations. It is clear from the press releases that we have been shown that the Department has been adept at presenting its case to the public and that it clearly has the specialist staff to carry out that function. We do not accept that the disclosure of the withheld information on the dates we have identified would have imposed a significantly increased burden on the Department in this respect. The evidence supporting both the likelihood and extent of these categories of harm lacked detail and appeared from Ms Hamp’s comment recorded in paragraph 26 (ii) to be little more than a vague sense that the FOIA had brought with it an obligation on government to explain itself to a greater extent than had previously been found necessary. That may be regarded as a benefit, provided that it does not give rise to a disproportionate burden, which in this case we think it does not. 63. The evidence on the likelihood of civil servants altering their behaviour in future with regard to their contributions to the preparation of a risk or issues register or to the conduct of a project review was, as Ms Hamp fairly conceded, speculative. It was also inconsistent as between her evidence and that of Ms Cox – see paragraph 2 vi. above. While accepting Ms Hamp’s knowledge and experience of major government projects, we did not feel able to accept her judgment that significant change would be likely if it became known that the information under consideration in this case were to have been disclosed four and six months after it had been created. Those periods of time are quite long in the context of the planned timetable for the Universal Credit Programme and in the case of the PAR it was on the point of being superseded by the time the request for its disclosure was refused. We are not convinced that reasonably robust civil servants would consider that the risk of disclosure in those circumstances would create pressure to change the way in which they operated. 64. The written evidence referred in several places to the possible perception that disclosure under FOIA was “routine”. This was in conflict with evidence recording the relatively few occasions on which the Department has found itself in dispute with the Information Commissioner on whether disclosure was appropriate in a particular case and with Ms Hamp’s apparent lack of concernover the impact of previous, similar FOIA disclosures. It did not, in any event, address the issue raised in Lewis regarding the likely awareness that a FOIA disclosure is possible in any case and that any concern in that regard is likely to be balanced by the civil servant’s awareness of the importance of candour in support of good decision-making and their professional obligation to assist that process. We would add to that the individual’s likely self interest in ensuring that his or her contribution should demonstrate expertise and judgment in order to reduce the risk of being associated with a failed project, or of being criticised in subsequent reviews (including those carried out by the NAO) for having failed to draw colleagues’ attention to problems with sufficient clarity to ensure that they were addressed effectively and in good time. 65. The answers given by Ms Hamp during the closed session did not fulfil the promise which she had held out in open session that her concerns about civil servant behaviour would be more clearly demonstrated by reference to specific items in the withheld documents. The issues addressed during the closed session, as we explained to Mr Slater after it ended, were the risk of fraud and hacking into the system, relations with commercial organisations (explained only in general terms and without reference to specific transactions) and relations with local government. We say no more in this open part of our decision than that no specific, likely impact on drafting any of the withheld documents became apparent during the closed session. 66. We should add that, even if accepted in full and without qualification, the Department’s evidence put the possible harm no higher than that risk, while being properly identified, might be recorded differently. Even then, the evidence was that the risk would arise mainly in the case of more junior personnel. Two of us have had extensive experience of conducting and/or reviewing project management by reference to the use of registers and periodic reviews. The third member has had more limited exposure. But we all three felt confident that, if junior members of a team were troubled and allowing this to affect the rigour with which they contributed to risk management activities, a reasonably effective project management process, operated by competent personnel at senior level would be expected to notice and correct the impact at an early stage. 67. The risk of misunderstanding by local authorities and other who work on the Programme with the Department was, again, put at a relatively low level. Ms Hamp accepted that senior members of, for example, a local authority would have been aware that they faced the prospect of making Housing Benefit officers redundant. It would raise questions about local management if they were not. The potential damage was therefore said to be limited to morejunior members of staff who might be surprised at the stage reached in project planning. However, the evidence also demonstrated that the Programme fell behind schedule at a relatively early stage. Although the delay may not have been publicly acknowledged by the Department or Secretary of State effective leadership of the programme would or should have ensured that local government, as a key partner in the programme, was kept informed and involved about the time table and thus enabled to manage the expectations of their more junior staff members. 68. We do not accept the Department’s submission that the management of the Universal Credit Programme is already exposed to sufficient public scrutiny and that this dilutes the strength of the arguments in favour of disclosure. On the particular facts of this case it is clear that the true story about the troubles which the Programme team faced only came to light a long time after the event and then showed a markedly different picture than had been portrayed by government statements issued at the time. Indeed, the other parties relied upon the difference as a significant factor in favour of disclosure. We believe that they were fully justified in doing so and that this factor carries significant weight in favour of disclosure. 69. Another factor in favour of disclosure, to which we apply weight, was the importance and cost of the Programme, particularly in light of the serious criticisms that subsequently came to light about the adequacy of the Department’s project management. Contrary to the Department’s argument we consider this to be as important (on a project of this size) as the decision to adopt the policy of a single route for payments in the first place. 70. We were less impressed by the argument that disclosure would serve a public interest in revealing how the MPA works. It seems to us that the information sought refers to only one review and that a broader picture of the MPA’s contribution to the Programme as a whole, as well as other programmes of a similar size, would be needed to provide meaningful information on the point. 71. The other public interest factors in favour of disclosure nevertheless carry significant weight, in our view. By contrast, the public interest factors in favour of maintaining the exemption carry relatively less weight, even at the level presented by the Department in its evidence. And we have decided that, even at that level, the fears expressed on behalf of the Department were over-stated, for the reasons we have given. 72. In light of our assessment of each of the factors set out above we have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption in respect of each of the withheld documents does notoutweigh the public interest in disclosure and that they should therefore have been disclosed when requested. 73. Our decision is unanimous ……….. Judge Chris Ryan 11th March 2016"
"53","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0050 ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50768307 Dated: 14 February 2019 Date of Hearing: 11 September 2019 Before JUDGE ROBERT GOOD TRIBUNAL MEMBER(S) MS MARION SAUNDERS AND MR PIETER DE WAAL Between GEORGE GREENWOOD Appellant -and- THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent -and- MINISTRY OF HOUSING, COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT Second Respondent Subject Matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) S.36(2) (Conduct of Public Affairs), S.40 (Personal Information) 1DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL For the reasons set out below the Tribunal dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Factual background 1. Mr Greenwood was working as an Investigations Producer for the BBC at the time he made the request on 23 February 2018. Following the fire at Grenfell Tower, he requested from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) the following information: “Please provide a copy of all communications between Brian Martin and Sajid Javid concerning a. Grenfell b. Fire safety standard for building materials from 13/06/17 to 23/02/18” 2. On 23 March 2018 MHCLG replied stating that it held information within the scope of Mr Greenwood’s request but the information was exempt under S.35 because it related to the formulation of government policy. 3. Mr Greenwood requested a review of this decision arguing that a blanket exemption had been applied and that the public interest in disclosure had not been properly considered. He considered that it was vital that the advice given by Mr Martin is fully accessible to the public to demonstrate openness sought by the relatives and loved ones who died or were injured in the fire. 4. Following an internal review, MHCLG found that the information remained exempt either under S.35 or S.36. MHCLG also apologised for applying S.35 in a blanket manner in its initial response. 25. Mr Greenwood complained to the Information Commissioner (IC) on 18 July 2018 about the refusal to provide the above information. He considered it unlikely that all the requested information would be exempt. In addition, Mr Greenwood stated that there was significant public interest in the government being open about its response to the Grenfell fire. He said “this public interest seems to strongly outweigh any generic concerns about free and frank advice and policy development in this case.” 6. The IC investigated the complaint. Following the start of this investigation, MHLG withdrew its application of s.35 and relied in the main on the exemption set out in S36, with some information exempt under S.40. 7. The IC was given the document at OBp211 and was satisfied that a qualified person has given an opinion, that this opinion is reasonable, and that the exemption in S.36(2) applies to all the withheld information. This is a qualified exemption and the IC went on to consider the public interest test. Her view was that, while there is considerable public interest in disclosure because of the high level of public interest in the Grenfell disaster and that the release of advice given would demonstrate openness and assist in greater public confidence in the inquiry process, there was greater public interest in the ability of officials to be able to provide clear and candid advice which is necessary for good decision making. Disclosure in the view of the IC would likely result in the loss of this ability and that this was not in the public interest. 8. In his grounds of appeal, Mr Greenwood states that MHLG has applied the S36 exemption in a blanket manner and that some of the information at least should be disclosed. In addition, Mr Greenwood argues that public interest is in disclosure so that the advice given by Mr Martin can be publicised “so his actions after the Grenfell disaster can be fully publicly accessible and held to 3account."" He states that it is important to demonstrate openness to assist those affected to engage in the inquiry process. 9. By Case Management Directions issued on 15/04/2019 MHCLG was made the Second Respondent in this appeal. Further Directions issued on 09/08/2019 allowed MHCLG to make submissions in the alternative on S40 and S42. The Hearing – Evidence and Submissions 10. Mr Greenwood attended the hearing, representing himself. At the beginning of the hearing he submitted that S36 should not apply to all the withheld information, even if it applied to some of it. The qualified person had approached the exemption in a blanket manner. But that, in any event, there was strong public interest favouring disclosure. There was a need to understand the process of government in the weeks after the disaster. The public interest in knowing what advice Mr Martin was giving and whether this advice was correct outweighs ‘safe space’ arguments. It is submitted that Mr Martin has an important outward facing role giving advice on technical policy issues. This type of technical advice, because of its nature, would not be affected if it was known that it would be accessible to the public at large. 11. The IC was not represented. However, the IC made both open and closed written submissions, both dated 05/09/2019. Ms Jennifer Thelan of counsel acted for MHCLG. She provided a written skeleton argument on behalf of MHCLG. 12. These submissions argue that, in considering whether the S36 exemption applies, there is first a threshold test, namely whether there is a reasonable opinion of a qualified person that any of the listed prejudices in S36 would or would be likely to occur. Secondly, if that threshold is passed whether or not, 4in all the circumstances, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing it. It is not for the Tribunal to substitute its view for that of the qualified person, but to consider whether that view was reasonably held. 13. The qualified person in this appeal was the Right Honourable James Brokenshire MP, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. His opinion is at exhibit 7 of Ms Kirwan’s statement. He was asked to consider the prejudices set out in S36(b)(i), S36(b)(ii) and S36(c). His view was that these prejudices are all likely to occur if there was disclosure. 14. MHCLG’s submission suggests that the reasonableness of the opinion is not an issue in this appeal; it is rather the public interest balancing exercise. Mr Greenwood was unwilling to go this far. However, his submissions about reasonableness of the opinion have been about whether the prejudice exists to all of the information, and in effect, that the qualified person should have looked in more detail at the material and ‘graded’ the level of prejudice that applied, and had that exercise been undertaken at least some of the information should have been disclosed. 15. Ms Frances Kirwan, Deputy Director of the Technical Policy Division in the Building Safety Portfolio of MHCLG, attended and gave evidence in both an open and closed session. There were no other witnesses. 16. The reported gist of the closed session was as follows: “The Second Respondent made submissions on its application to redact one sentence of paragraph 63. The witness, Ms Kirwan, provided evidence regarding documents 9 and 10 and addressed the public interest balancing in the content of those documents, as well as some of the general closed themes running through the closed evidence.” 5Reasons and Conclusions 17. It is not disputed that the Right Honourable James Brokenshire MP, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government was a qualified person under S.36 or that he provided an opinion on 23/01/2019 that disclosure would likely inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views or would otherwise likely prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. 18. It is the Tribunal’s view that this opinion was reasonably held. The disputed information was shown to the qualified person with information about why it was considered that the information was exempt. The opinion includes reasons why the qualified person decided that the exemption applied. The request, made on 23/02/2018, is for communications from 13/06/2017 to 23/02/2018. The Grenfell fire took place on the night of 13/14 June 2017. 19. The request was considered and refused in March 2018. Policy development and work in response to the Grenfell fire was ongoing in 2018. Hearings for Phase 1 of the Public Inquiry began on 21/05/2018. Part of the terms of reference for this Inquiry is to examine the scope and adequacy of Building Regulations, Fire Regulations and other legislation. At the time the request was considered the issues were current and ongoing. 20. Mr Martin is Head of Technical Policy (Grade 6) at MHCLG. He took up this role on 01/11/2017. Prior to that he was Principal Construction Professional (Grade 7) at MHCLG. He is part of a team responsible for providing policy advice to Ministers in technical areas. 21. The Tribunal consider that the view of the qualified person is reasonable. The information requested remained in an active policy area and continued to be a significant political issue. The Tribunal accept the arguments put forward by 6the IC and MHCLG that the Tribunal has to consider whether the qualified person’s view is reasonably held and it is clear that that there is a strong link between the disclosure and the prejudice identified under S.36. 22. The Tribunal finds that the opinion was reasonable in relation to all the information in the communications. It is not for the Tribunal to consider each bit of information but to consider whether processes may be inhibited by disclosure. It is a reasonable view that these processes of advice and exchange of views would be inhibited if there was disclosure. 23. The exemption is a qualified exemption. Tribunal considered the public interest test. The majority of Mr Greenwood’s submission related to the public interest in full disclosure of the advice given to Ministers in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire. The scale of the tragedy and the failure of the cladding to keep residents safe had resulted in a significant loss of faith in government and in previous practices in relation to building safety. He submitted that knowing the advice given by Mr Martin and being able to evaluate whether it was correct outweighs concerns about the need for a ‘safe space’. In his view, Mr Martin was a senior, public facing civil servant whose views may be controversial. There should not be ‘closed doors’ and transparency is in the public interest in order for those affected to feel they are getting the truth about what went wrong. 24. There is strong public interest in disclosure. However, disclosure is taking place through the Public Inquiry and through disclosure of information by the government. This request is very specific. It is for the communications between Mr Martin and the Secretary of State from the date of the fire to the date of request. The importance of civil servants being able to give free and frank advice on request, often at short notice, is important. The Tribunal considered the communications and accepts Ms Kirwal’s evidence that this type of advice is central to the working of government and there is a strong 7public interest in ensuring that this advice is not inhibited and that there is no prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs. 25. Ms Kirwal’s evidence is helpful in this balancing exercise. The Tribunal accepts that the information sought is a small part of the overall activity which was taking place after the fire and does not reflect the range of advice given and may not even reflect the final advice given. The public interest in disclosure is not significant when the specific information sought is considered. The Tribunal considered that this view was supported by the considerable public disclosure taking place both by government and through the Public Inquiry. 26. On the other side of this exercise, space is needed for government to consider the appropriate response to a major tragedy like the Grenfell fire. Advice is given under significant time constraints. This advice may be developed or amended when it is further considered by the team. Tribunal is satisfied that the public interest in non disclosure outweighs any public interest benefit derived from disclosure. 27. Because of the findings of the Tribunal that all the information is correctly withheld under S.36 it is not necessary to consider the other exemptions. 28. In the circumstances, the Tribunal unanimously upholds the Commissioner’s decision and dismisses the appeal.

"225","FOI","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Tribunal Reference: EA/2014/0086 Appellant: Debbie Bryce Respondent: The Information Commissioner Second Respondent Trinity Hall, Cambridge Judge: Peter Lane Member: Alison Lowton Member: Roger Creedon Hearing Date: 30 April 2015 Decision Date: 10 June 2015 Promulgation Date: 11 June 2015 DECISION NOTICE 1. On 25 February 2013 the appellant wrote to Trinity Hall (“the College”) requesting information that she believed had been deposited in the College’s archives by Trinity Hall Association (“THA”), an alumni association. The appellant’s request was later clarified as a request for archive records of the minutes of meetings of THA, and of its correspondence, in the years 2003 to 2008. 2. The Commissioner found that THA was separately constituted and separately financed from the College; that THA was not a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and that the College, as a general matter, did not have access to THA’s documents. The Commissioner held that THA minutes of meetings for 2003 to 2008 were published on the College’s website and held by the College for the purposes of FOIA but that the College did not hold any other relevant THA correspondence. The Commissioner found that THA minutes for the relevant period were accessible on the College’s website and the College was accordingly not required by the Commissioner to take any steps. 3. It is common ground that the notice of decision is factually incorrect, to the extent that the THA minutes on the website from 2003 to 2008 are the minutes ofthe THA’s annual general meetings. The appellant’s request was directed at the minutes of all meetings of THA, including those of its Committee. 4. The appellant appealed to the First Tier Tribunal. Her case, in essence, is that THA is part of the College, with the result that material held by THA in the private residence of any of its officers, such as the Secretary of THA, is held by the College, which is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA. The appellant also contends that, in any event, the College, as a matter of fact, holds non-AGM minutes and correspondence of THA for the relevant period. 5. The First-tier Tribunal reached a decision on the appeal in October 2014. That decision was, however, set aside by the Chamber President pursuant to section 9 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. He ordered that the appeal be considered afresh by a differently constituted Tribunal, which would not be bound by any previous findings. At the time of the original decision, the College was not a party to the appeal. The College was subsequently made a party and has submitted a response and other written material, including witness statements. 6. An oral hearing of the appeal took place on 30 April 2015 at East London Tribunals, London E14. The appellant appeared in person. The Commissioner did not appear and was not represented. The College was represented by Ms R Kamm of counsel. We heard oral evidence from Dr Chris Angus, Secretary of THA and from Mrs Sheila Hunter, Personal Assistant to the Bursar of the College and its Compliance Officer. The Tribunal endeavoured to assist the appellant in asking questions of the witnesses and generally as to the presentation of her case. When the appellant announced, during the course of the proceedings, that she had not received her copy of the bundle sent to her by the Commissioner, the Tribunal gave the appellant the opportunity of examining the bundle, to make notes thereon and to correlate it with the materials the appellant had in other form. 7. Dr Angus’ statement records that he is an alumnus of Trinity Hall, having matriculated in 1967. He joined the Committee of THA in 2008, subsequently becoming Secretary at the AGM in September 2011. As such, he sets the agenda for meetings, and is responsible for taking minutes, the preparation of reports on THA’s activities and dealing with external correspondence. Dr Angus states that he is also responsible for holding the physical records of THA, with the exception of historic records which have been deposited in the College archives (we note that these relate to a period far earlier than 2003 to 2008). 8. Dr Angus stated that THA is an autonomous body with its own constitution, funding and governance structures. The Governing Body of the College has no representation on THA’s Committee and no control over the operation of THA at either a strategic or day to day level. Control of THA’s finances is under the guardianship of THA’s financial officer, who is the Company Secretary of a major global engineering company. 9. In 2003/2004, a generous benefactor, Dennis Avery, made two large financial gifts. One gift was, in effect, to pay the College to provide secretarial support to THA. The second gift was to THA directly, which chose to have the investment 2managed by the College, where the endowment is ring-fenced, with dividends paid to THA. The minutes of the Committee of THA on 10 September 2003, submitted by THA specifically in connection with this appeal, stress the essential nature of THA being independent of the College: “It should not depend upon the College for funding or become inevitably enmeshed in fund raising”. The template of THA’s stationery, created by Dr Angus, includes the College’s crest as a form of branding but, according to Dr Angus, this is in no way intended to imply that THA is part of the College. 10. THA minutes and correspondence for 2003 to 2008 are, Dr Angus said, held as paper copies in lever-arch files and boxes that, as current Secretary, he holds at his private address. This was so at the date of the appellant’s request. None of this material has been transferred to the College archives, although there had been discussions about the possibility of doing this, which came to nothing. 11. Dr Angus stated that any THA minutes or correspondence materials generated by College staff on behalf of THA were of such a kind that he “can see no reason at all why the College would want to retain copies of such minutes in either paper or electronic form” and that “I do not believe that the collected correspondence for the period in question is available other than from the set of paper records in my possession”. 12. In the course of questioning by the appellant and the Tribunal, Dr Angus said that the College has no control over THA and that the College was used “as a facility” by THA. Two members of the College’s staff attended Committee meetings of THA but they were, in this capacity, under the instruction of THA; rather than the other way round. No one from the College has or could dictate what THA should do. Though an alumni liaison committee had been created a few years ago, it was subsequently done away with. 13. Dr Angus said that he was a “year rep”, a concept borrowed from American Universities, whereby a person is nominated by the College to keep in touch with people of their year of matriculation. Alumni who gave consent to their details being passed to their year rep did not thereby give consent to the information being passed to THA. Accordingly, as THA Secretary, Dr Angus needs to contact the alumnus in question through the Alumni Office of the College, in order to ask whether the person is content to have details passed to THA. If Dr Angus contacted alumni, this tended to be in his capacity as year rep rather than as a THA officer. As Secretary, he has no access to College data, other than that which the College could provide him with the permission of the person concerned. The THA has no access to the College’s computer systems. 14. Dr Angus was asked about the rules of the THA. These set out its objects as follows:- “1. To provide an organisation that will keep Trinity Hall members worldwide in touch with each other and with the College. 2. To ensure that Trinity Hall members’ view are heard in matters connection with the welfare of the college. 3. To arrange social gatherings or other events for the purpose of drawing Trinity Hall members together. 34. To arrange and to hold an Annual Meeting as well as an Annual Dinner in the College. 5. To provide, generate and support other events of interest to members throughout the year”. 15. The Rules also state that all Trinity Hall members who matriculate are automatically members of THA and that such membership is free. The remaining rules deal with the management of THA, through an elected committee, comprising a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Financial Officer and “10 members representing as far as possible Trinity Hall interests, of whom at least 8 shall be current Year Rep at the time of their appointment”. 16. Dr Angus said that the election to the Committee was an informal process, whereby people who could be of use were approached. They would be elected at the AGM, which was open to all members. Dr Angus agreed with the appellant that more information about candidates for election to the Committee could probably be provided to members of THA. 17. Mrs Hunter’s witness statement includes this:- “4. I have been told that Ms Bryce considers that THA is part of the College. Trinity Hall is a college in the University of Cambridge and its members are the Master, and Fellows, along with junior members who are undergraduates and graduate students of the College. The master and fellows constitute the Governing Body of the College to whose meetings are invited junior member representatives (for unrestricted business). The Governing Body is constituted and regulated in accordance with college Statutes. The Governing Body is responsible for the strategic direction of the college, for its on-going administration, and for the management of its finances and assets. Supporting the Governing Body is a range of committees and advisory groups; the THA has no representation on Governing Body or on any college committees or advisory groups (except where they have been invited to sit as external members on now moribund alumni related committees in the past). 5. The Trinity Hall Association is a separately constituted and independently financed and run alumni association. It has its own Rules of Association which set out the purposes of the association and a committee; the Governing Body of the College has no representation on the THA Committee and no control over the operation of the THA. Since 2004 the THA has been financed by the income produced from a gift given to it by a benefactor, prior to that time I understand that it was financed by a one-off fee paid by all alumni on graduation from the College. 6. The College also received a gift from a benefactor in 2004 to enable it to provide secretariat support to the THA via its alumni and development office. The alumni and development office only acts on behalf of the THA and only at the direction of the THA Committee. Typically this involves sending out invitations to THA events on behalf of the THA Committee using the College’s alumni database, processing bookings for 4events, and forwarding correspondence received from the THA, either electronic or physical to the secretary of the THA. 7. College staff are not involved in the preparation or circulation of the agenda and minutes for THA committee meetings nor do they respond to correspondence for the THA, other than in connection with an event booking. Representatives of the alumni and development office are invited to attend THA committee meetings in an advisory capacity but are not members of the committee. It is usually only the development director who attends THA Committee meetings”. 18. Mrs Hunter goes on to state that the College only holds copies of THA minutes (with the exception of AGM minutes) for the period between 1904 and 21 May 1966, which were in a physical form in the College’s archive. The College does not hold any THA correspondence from 2003 to 2008. Details of THA material held in the archive is documented in the on line catalogue known as Janus, which is available to the public and can be accessed via the internet. 19. Mrs Hunter has confirmed this position with both the Fellow Archivist, Dr Pollard, and with Mr Robert Athol, who was formerly the Assistant Archivist. She has also personally visited the archive to examine the documents held. Mrs Hunter has, “confirmed verbally with Mr Athol that he believes that he catalogued all THA material held in the archive prior to his departure in July 2014, and I do not believe that any other THA documents are held elsewhere in the College, other than the material available via the College website”. 20. Mrs Hunter considers that the actions undertaken constitute a “reasonable search of the archive for the information that Ms Bryce requested”. 21. So far as concerns relevant material that might be held by the College otherwise than in its archive, Mrs Hunter stated:- “15. From my discussions with the Development Director, Dr Rachelle Stretch, I believe that the College Alumni and Development Office does not hold copies of the requested minutes, or any THA correspondence, either in hard copy or on the College computer system (email attached). Those minutes that were circulated to staff in the Alumni and Development Office were routinely deleted after any relevant action points had been carried out and to retained by the college in either paper or electronic form and they were not held by the College at the time of the request. The exception to this was the THA AGM minutes which … are available on the College website. No other College staff outside the Alumni and Development Office would have been copied with minutes of THA Committee meetings. 16. Dr Stretch has confirmed to me that, where the College was contacted about a THA matter, other than events, in the period 2003 to 2008 the majority of the communications were hard copy letters which were forwarded to the THA and that the College did not retain a copy. Where the College was contacted about a THA matter by email, the email would have 5been forwarded to the THA committee at their personal email address and the standard practice was for such emails to be deleted once any required action had been completed. Any responses to alumni to such letters or emails would have been made by the THA from their personal email addresses or by post and these replies were not copied to the College. The tha@trinhall.cam.ac.uk address to enable emails to be relayed to the THA committee was not introduced until the beginning of 2013.” 22. Under questioning by the Tribunal and the appellant, Mrs Hunter stated that the decision as to what to hold in the archive was made by the Archivist, who would decide what would be accepted. She confirmed that she had spoken to the Assistant Archivist, who said that he had catalogued all the THA material held in the archive; but that Mrs Hunter also went to the archive herself, but could not find anything. College correspondence would be retained by the College but THA correspondence is forwarded without taking a copy, since it is not regarded as the College’s correspondence. Correspondence would be shared amongst staff only if there was a need. 23. The College’s case is that at no material time did it hold any information falling within the scope of the appellant’s request, with the exception of the AGM minutes which were available on the website. The materials held by THA at the home of Dr Angus are not held by the College for the purposes of the FOIA, because THA is not part of the College. 24. The College’s case has two further aspects, which only come into play if THA is part of the College and/or THA material within the scope of the request is held by the College. These are that the THA material may be exempt from disclosure by reason of section 40(1) and/or 40(2) of FOIA; and that the appellant’s request was vexatious. 25. The appellant considers that, far from being independent, THA exists only to serve the development function of the College. She believes it is necessary to see any contract that may exist between the THA benefactor and the College. Only a perusal of THA Committee minutes would show whether independence has been achieved. THA is in the nature of a “virtual” organisation that exists only by reference to the College. The part played by the College’s staff in THA affairs underscores this point. 26. The appellant thinks it is implausible that the material is not, in fact, held by the College in its archive. The appellant had been informed that there was space for such material to be held. Conversations with a librarian in another institution reinforced the appellant’s view that the material was, in reality, held. 27. We have had full regard to the submissions, both written and oral, and to the oral and written evidence, including that not specifically referred to in this decision. Our decision on the appeal is unanimous. 28. The Tribunal has considered carefully and holistically the issue of whether THA is part of the College for the purposes of the FOIA. Having done so, we are in no doubt that the THA is a separate entity for these purposes. We accept the 6evidence we have heard in this regard from the witnesses. The objects of THA, set out above, make it plain that – contrary to the appellant’s views – THA does not exist in order to serve the development function of the College. In other words, it is not the College’s fund-raising arm, or even part of it. Of course, the fact that THA is an association of alumni of the College means that it has a connection with the College. However, the degree of that connection, on the evidence, falls far short of showing any legal right or de facto ability of the College to control or otherwise influence THA. 29. The fact that staff members of the College provide secretarial support to THA, as a result of funding made available by a benefactor, is not indicative of any control or other influence by the College on THA’s affairs. We see no reason to reject the evidence of Dr Angus regarding the distinction drawn between his position as year rep, on the one hand, and his position as Secretary of THA on the other. We find that Dr Angus and the College keep separate the data protection position of alumni, vis a vis the College and THA respectively. 30. In this regard, we note from the materials that the appellant has asked THA not to provide the College with copies of THA’s correspondence with the appellant; a matter which underscores the separate nature of the two entities. 31. The appellant submitted that it was necessary to examine a contract between the benefactor and the College regarding services provided to THA. There is, however, no reliable evidence that any such contracts exist. In any event, we consider the evidence adduced by the College regarding that relationship to be truthful. Given that one of the aims of the benefaction was to ensure the independence of THA, it would frankly be remarkable if any such contract were to have produced the opposite result. 32. We anticipate the appellant may criticise the Tribunal for failing to pursue this matter with the “robustness” she may wish. However, the Tribunal must act on such evidence as is before it and the appellant has not begun to show that it would be in the interests of the overriding objective to compel disclosure of any such contract. On the contrary, to do so would merely be to enter into what is often referred to as a “fishing expedition”. 33. Accordingly, none of the material held by the Secretary or other officers of THA, relating to the relevant period, is held by the College as a public authority under the FOIA. 34. We turn to the issue of whether THA material for 2003 to 2008, within the terms of the appellant’s request, is held by the College, whether in its archive or otherwise. In this regard also, we have carefully considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, particularly those of the appellant. She considers that it is implausible that no such material is held. She derives assistance from this view, inter alia, because of her understanding that there is space in the archive and because of what she understands to be the views of the librarian of another institution. 35. The issue for the Tribunal is whether it is more likely than not that the material is held by this public authority. Having considered the evidence, in 7particular that of Mrs Hunter, who (like Dr Angus) we found to be an entirely credible witness, we are fully satisfied that it is more likely than not that the material is not held. Mrs Hunter has explained the nature of the investigation she has undertaken in relation to the archive. Those investigations are, we consider, of an entirely reasonable nature. 36. We also find as a fact that it is more likely than not that the relevant material does not exist elsewhere in the College. Given the nature of THA and of the College staff’s involvement, we find it entirely plausible that any such material which the staff might take away from meetings would not be retained for more than a short period and, certainly, not from 2003 to 2008. The evidence makes it plain that such staff would have no reason to keep the THA material. The appellant’s questioning of Mrs Hunter on this issue failed to disclose any hint of such a reason. 37. We allow the appeal to the extent that the Commissioner’s notice of decision falls to be read as if, in paragraph 20, the reference to minutes in the last sentence were a reference to minutes of the THA’s AGMs in 2003 to 2008 and that the decision notice should record that non-AGM minutes for 2003 to 2008 are not held by the College. No action, however, falls to be taken as a result of this amendment. 38. Otherwise, for the reasons we have given, the appeal is dismissed. Because we have found that THA is not part of the College, it has not been necessary for the Tribunal to reach any findings on the alternative submissions of the College as regards the issues of data protection and vexatiousness.

REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. The Legal Services Commission (“LSC”), was an executive agency of the Second Respondent, the Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) responsible for the administration of legal aid. It was replaced in 2013 by a new executive agency of the MOJ, the Legal Aid Agency (“LAA”) with a similar role. 2. In 2010 it conducted a public procurement exercise with a view to awarding contracts to firms of solicitors to represent legally aided individuals in civil cases. There were difficulties in the conduct of the tendering exercise, notably with respect to the use of the technology for submitting tenders. A number of firms which were unsuccessful in the tender exercise (including Mr Nadarajah’s firm) launched judicial review proceedings in an attempt to demonstrate that the firms had been unlawfully treated and should be funded to carry out this work. The course of litigation varied in each 2Appeal No: EA/2014/0226 & 0228 case and at least one case (not relating to Mr Nadarajah’s firm) is still before the courts. 3. In one joined case (R (ota Hersi and Co, Harrow Solicitors) v Lord Chancellor) a consent order was agreed by the parties as to the material to be disclosed by the MOJ and put before the court to enable it to compare the attributes and situations of firms which had been awarded contracts with firms which had not, in order to consider whether the relevant differences were lawful grounds for the decisions on whether or not to award contracts. 4. The information about the firms had been submitted to the MOJ by the firms (or derived from such information) and was clearly confidential commercial information about those firms. There were three distinct provisions relating to confidentiality; clauses 4 (which provides for anonymization), 6 (which relates to material disclosed to the Claimants) and 7. Clause 7 provides:- The names of comparator firms in the pleadings shall be treated as confidential. The parties shall file a covering note with the pleadings stating that the details of third party firms are confidential and that the pleadings should not be disclosed to anyone other than the parties save with the express permission of the Administrative Court. The Court shall refer to all these firms by their anonymization numbers and no person shall report or disclose the names of these third party firms or the detail of the information requested to be clarified by the Defendant save with the express permission of the Administrative Court”. 5. On 29 December 2013 Mr Abdalla (who is believed by the Second Respondent to be associated with a solicitor still pursing litigation arising out of the tender exercise) wrote to the MOJ to make a FOIA request:- “I would like to obtain information and comments concerning an organisation called [solicitor A]. Could I obtain copies of any correspondence (including letters, emails, reprentations [sic] etc between the then LSC and [solicitor A} between the dates of 15 June 2010 and 5 December 2010. 3Appeal No: EA/2014/0226 & 0228 Please include the letter before claim received from [solicitor A} and the LSC’s reply to it. Please confirm whether [solicitor A] obtained a contract because another organisation had its allocation of cases (New Matter Starts) withdrawn. If yes what is the name of the organisation that had its allocation of cases withdrawn and the number of cases that became available as a result of that withdrawal. On what date did the LSC first informed [sic] [solicitor A] about the fact that its tender was successful.” 6. On 26 December 2013 Mr Nadarajah sought remarkably similar information about the same firm as well as seeking information about another firm involved in the tender process:- “Could I have copies of any correspondence between the LSC and [solicitor B] regarding the process which led to the award of a full civil contract in 2011. Particularly between June 2011 and November 2011 concerning the issue of awarding a full immigration contract in 2011. Please confirm who initiated the process which led to the award of a contract at that time to [solicitor B]. Please confirm whether [solicitor B] submitted any new tender documents at the time in question such as supervisor declaration form. I understand that [solicitor B] initial tender expired on or about 28 April 2010. Furthermore, between January 2010 and September 2011 the accreditation of [solicitor B] supervisor expired and this caused a delay for the award of the contract to take place. Please confirm if any of those facts are correct.” 7. The MOJ responded to both requests deeming them to be vexatious and maintained that position on review. The Appellants complained to the First Respondent the Information Commission (“ICO”) who conducted an investigation. He concluded that the requests were not vexatious, however he accepted the MOJ’s second argument that to disclose the information would be in breach of the court order and on that basis upheld the MOJ’s refusal to supply information. The appellants have appealed against this decision. The MOJ has been joined as a party to these proceedings. 4Appeal No: EA/2014/0226 & 0228 The appeal to the Tribunal 8. The issue before the tribunal is very simple. Mr Nadarajah has at some stage been given access to some of the comparator material. Mr Abdalla believes that the information he has requested relates to a comparator firm. The question for the tribunal to determine is whether the disclosure of the information requested about a comparator firm would be in breach of the provision of the order set out at paragraph 3 above, since s44 FOIA provides:- “44.— Prohibitions on disclosure. (1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it— (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment, (b) is incompatible with any EU obligation, or (c) would constitute or be punishable as a contempt of court. …” 9. On behalf of the Appellants it was argued that the order was imprecise and not time limited and that therefore if the MOJ were to disclose the information, it would not constitute a contempt of court. Reliance was placed on SC (Children) [2010] EWCA Civ 21 (an appeal against an order for committal to prison for contempt) where it was held (paragraph 17):- Contempt will not be established where the breach is of an order which is ambiguous, or which does not require or forbid the performance of a particular act within a specific time frame. The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is they are required to do or abstain from doing” 10. The Commissioner relied on the findings in his decision notice. The information requested fell within the terms of the order and therefore the exemption was engaged. The Order expressly provided that information should not be disclosed without the express permission of the Court. The order was and remains live. To disclose the information would be to breach the Order and therefore be punishable as contempt. The MOJ supported this position. The MOJ placed before the Tribunal in closed session the schedule of documents before the Court in the judicial review proceedings stating that “the schedule extends to the information about the named firms of 5Appeal No: EA/2014/0226 & 0228 solicitors to whom the Appellants requests under FOIA relate, and that this information is therefore caught by the Court Order.” Consideration 11. The tribunal noted that the factual circumstances were very different from the underlying situation in SC . The court order was a consent order in commercial litigation. It was agreed between the parties to the litigation in order to deal with the issue of confidential material relating to third party firms of solicitors who were not involved in the litigation but who seemed to be relevant comparators so as to enable the Court to evaluate the claim by the firms seeking judicial review that they had been unfairly treated. In order for the comparison to be of any use to the Court it would clearly have been necessary for the information about these solicitors to go beyond their names and to include a range of information about the firms which was relevant to the decision as to whether they would be awarded a contract. 12. The comparison would involve a range of commercial information relating to issues which, in the view of the LSC, were relevant to its decision whether or not to award the contract. In the nature of a tender for services it is inevitable that among the information likely to be assessed in determining whether or not to award a contract is likely to be information relating to the financial history and robustness of the firm, the skills experience and professional histories of the individuals providing the service, the structures underpinning the provision of the proposed services and the history of the assessment process with respect to that firm carried out by LAA. The focus of these FOIA requests is on the history of the assessment process and contact between the LAA and the comparator firm during this period. 13. The consent order was agreed between parties who knew what the issues in the litigation were and was written in order to protect the commercial confidentiality of the comparators; the judge made an order to give effect to that agreement and to provide that the information should be disclosed to the Claimants in the judicial review on a confidential basis purely for use in that litigation. 14. In essence the Appellants in these proceedings wish to revisit or further explore issues concerning comparator firms from the judicial review proceedings. They wish to re-open through FOIA requests issues which could have been or were addressed in 6Appeal No: EA/2014/0226 & 0228 judicial review and which were then subject to the usual rules with respect to disclosure for the purposes of litigation. 15. The order states:- no person shall report or disclose the names of these third party firms or the detail of the information requested to be clarified by the Defendant save with the express permission of the Administrative Court 16. While the names of third party firms may be known to Mr Nadarajah that information is not in the public domain, furthermore the “detail of the information” is not in the public domain. The request would require the MOJ to disclose information which it knows is protected by a Court Order designed to maintain the confidentiality of litigation disclosure. It does not require anything to be done within any specific time, rather it requires something not to be done ever. 17. The tribunal is satisfied that these requests are attempts to bring into the public domain information which is protected by Court order from disclosure. The appeals are without merit and are dismissed. 18. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 14 July 2015 7"

For the reasons set out below the Tribunal allows the appeal against Decision Notice FS50620631 and issues the following substitute decision notice. 12. All parties consented to the matter being determined on the papers and the Tribunal considered that it was appropriate to determine the appeal without an oral hearing. 3. There is also a closed annex in order not to undermine the Tribunal’s decision on what information should be disclosed in accordance with rule 14. The annex will remain closed until after the latest date for applying for permission to appeal or until the conclusion of any appeal. A redacted version of the annex will be released after that date. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: The Cabinet Office Complainant: Mr Richard Farrar The Substitute Decision – FS50620631 1. The scope of the request is set out in the reasons below. 2. The Cabinet Office does, on the balance of probabilities, hold military medals review team information. The Tribunal has ordered the Cabinet Office to provide this information or serve a notice under s 17 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 3. In relation to information not falling within para 2 above, for the reasons set out below and in the closed annex, s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) of FOIA are engaged and: a. the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in relation to the parts of the withheld information identified in the closed annex; b. the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the exemption in relation to the remainder of the withheld information identified in the closed annex. Action Required 1. The Public Authority is required to respond to the complainant’s request for information relating to the military medals review team either by providing the requested information or by serving a notice under s 17 FOIA indicating what exemptions it relies on within 42 days of the promulgation of this judgment. 2. The Public Authority is required to supply the information identified in the closed annex within 42 days of the promulgation of this judgment. 2REASONS Introduction and procedural background 1. Mr Farrar is involved in a campaign for retrospective medallic recognition for those who served in Korea post-Armistice, between 28 July 1953 and 26 July 1957. The request, dated 10 January 2016, asks for information relating to the decision not to award a Korea post-Armistice medal. 2. This is the Cabinet Office’s appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice of 1 November 2016 FS50620631 which held that s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) were engaged but that the public interest favoured disclosing some of the requested information. 3. Four appeals arising out of a similar factual background have been heard by the Tribunal on the same day. They are: EA/2016/0078 (Morland v IC and Cabinet Office); EA/2017/0295 (Cabinet Office v IC and Scriven); EA/2016/0281 (Cabinet Office v IC and Farrar); and EA/2018/0098 (Cabinet Office v IC and Halligan). Much of the factual background appears in each decision. Factual background 4. The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, but British Troops remained in the Korean peninsula until July 1957. There is a long running campaign amongst veterans for a medal to recognise post-Armistice service in Korea. Post-Armistice medals have been issued by the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Mr Farrar is active in that campaign. 5. A medal review was carried out by the Ministry of Defence in 2011. This review was described as ‘flawed and discredited’ by the UK NDM (‘National Defence Medal’) campaign. On 30 April 2012 the Prime Minister announced a further independent review. 6. In May and June 2012 Sir John Holmes conducted an independent review of the policy concerning military medals. The review team received over 200 submissions, including a submission on the retrospective issue of a British Korea medal or clasp for service after the ceasefire on 27 July 1953. The review team also spoke to more than 50 individuals including representatives from veteran groups. 37. Sir John Holmes published a report in July 2012 (‘the Holmes Report’). It recommended that: The reconstituted HD Committee, on advice from the new military sub-committee, should be asked to look again rapidly at the main long-standing controversies to try to draw a line under them, on the basis of the criteria set out in paragraphs 30-33 of Section 3. It should start with the longest-standing issues, notably that surrounding the Arctic Convoys from the Second World War. An independent expert should be commissioned on a temporary basis to advise the sub-committee on these controversies rapidly but fully, starting from the material provided to the Review. 8. Paragraph 17, p 10 of the Holmes Report reads as follows: … the current system of decision-making is vulnerable to the charge of being a “black box” operation, where those outside have no knowledge of what is being decided or why and have no access to it; and where the rules and principles underlying the decisions, while frequently referred to, have never been properly codified or promulgated. 9. With specific reference to the HD Committee, the Holmes Report stated, on p27: The process is also largely invisible and inaccessible to those outside the system, which has substantially added to the frustration of veterans and other campaigners, unable to penetrate beyond bland official statements that a particular decision has been taken. 10. With reference to the Korea post-armistice issue, the report stated as follows: Korea Post Armistice 26.The Review has received a detailed submission from the Korea Post Armistice Medal Campaign which seeks medallic recognition for the thousands of British troops who served in Korea following the July 1953 Armistice until the final British withdrawal in July 1957. The Campaign argues that the arduous climate and physical conditions, and the continuing real risk of a sudden resumption of hostilities, represented service that was significantly more difficult and dangerous than could usually be expected. They illustrate with a range of examples continuing tensions in the demilitarized zone and emphasise the political instability. They note that other Commonwealth countries and the US have all established medallic recognition for personnel who served in Korea after the war. 27.In particular they point to the findings of a 2005 Australian working party established to review the level of recognition after the Armistice, and query why the UK has not adopted a similar approach for British service personnel. 28.MoD has not evaluated the potential coverage or estimated the potential cost of such an award. 411. Under the United Kingdom Constitution, honours and decorations are created and conferred by Her Majesty the Queen in her personal capacity as Monarch rather than on behalf of the Government. The ‘HD Committee’ (the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals) is a sub-committee of the Cabinet. It is a permanent standing committee established in 1939 at the request of George VI to provide advice to The Sovereign on policy concerning honours, decorations and medals. It operates under the direction of the Head of the Civil Service, who nominally chairs the Committee, and its current terms of reference are: To consider general questions relative to the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals; to review the scales of award, both civil and military, from time to time, to consider questions of new awards, and changes in the conditions governing existing awards. 12. The HD Committee directly advises The Queen on policy relating to the grant of individual honours, decorations and medals. It also considers general questions relating to this topic, including the introduction of new awards. The Committee’s more general recommendations are also put forward for The Sovereign’s formal approval. 13. The HD Committee meets typically two or three times a year. The role of chair of the HD Committee is currently formally delegated to Sir Jonathan Stephens, Permanent Secretary to the Northern Ireland Office. The members of the HD Committee are: Private Secretary to HM The Queen Principal Private Secretary to the PM Permanent Secretary, FCO Permanent Secretary, Home Office Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence Defence Services Secretary Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of the Knighthood. 14. Following the Holmes report, the Prime Minister asked Sir John Holmes to lead a second stage of work to make further recommendations using the principles he had proposed to implement his findings. Reviews of certain claims for medallic recognition were undertaken by an independent review team, and Sir John Holmes’s recommendations in relation to these were put before the Advisory Military Sub-Committee (the ‘AMSC’ – a sub-committee of the HD Committee set up in response to the Holmes report) at the first meeting of the AMSC, on 12 December 2012 and 29 August 2013. At that meeting on 29 August Sir John Holmes outlined 21 further claims for medallic recognition which had not yet been looked at by the independent review team, and gave recommendations as to the way forward, i.e. whether or not these should be reviewed. 515. All these claims came before the HD Committee on 29 January 2014 and/or on 9 June 2014. 16. On 29 July 2014 a written ministerial statement from Baroness Stowell informed the House of Lords that the review was complete, stating that: Sir John was therefore commissioned to review independently a number of cases which had been brought to his attention as possible candidates for changed medallic recognition. The aim was to draw a definitive line under issues which in some cases had been controversial for many years… Each of the reviews has been subject to detailed discussion by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals and its conclusions submitted for Royal Approval….The outcomes where detailed reviews were carried out are listed in the Annexe to this statement. 17. The conclusion in relation to the Korea post-armistice medal set out in the Annexe was: There will be no retrospective issue of a British Korea Medal or clasp for service after the ceasefire on 27 July 1953. There was a certain amount of rigour endured at the time, but insufficient risk to warrant the award of a medal. 18. In relation to the NDM Baroness Stowell stated that the HD Committee was ‘not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time but has advised that this issue might usefully be considered in the future’. This was in contrast to other historic claims for medallic recognition where it was stated in the Annexe that no other historic claims will now be reviewed, unless significant new evidence were produced that an injustice has been done. 19. The NDM options paper that was considered by the HD Committee at the point that it made its recommendations was placed in the Library of the Lords. We accept the Cabinet Office’s assertion that although it is dated after the HD Committee meeting, that is merely the date of publication and that it is the same options paper that was before the Committee. 20. Correspondence subsequently took place between the Cabinet Office and the NDM campaign and the HD Committee considered that correspondence at a meeting on 23 February 2015, concluding that the time was not right for a review. In an email to Mr Morland dated 8 April 2015, Gary Rogers of the Cabinet Office stated, in relation to the meeting of 23 February 2015: HD Committee had before it recent correspondence from Colonel Scriven, Co- Chairman of the UK National Defence Medal Campaign, but whilst the Committee noted the points made by Colonel Scriven, members remained unpersuaded of the case for an NDM at this time. In light of this, there are no plans for further work on this issue… You will be aware that Stephen Gilbert’s Private Member’s Bill on the National Defence Medal which was due to have a second reading on 27 February, were not reached. 621. There was a House of Commons Debate on NDM on 12 April 2016. The HD Committee considered reopening the NDM issue again on 1 February 2017 but remained unconvinced. 22. By letter dated 14 February 2017 Colonel Scriven made an official complaint under the Cabinet Office complaints procedure to the minister for the Cabinet Office, Ben Gummer MP. The complaint alleged failures by the head of the Honours and Appointments Secretariat to appropriately oversee the Cabinet Office responsibilities of the Holmes review and the alleged provision of misinformation about the veracity of the medal review process. Mr Gummer tasked Sir Jonathan Stephens, the chair of the HD Committee, with carrying out an investigation into the complaint. 23. Sir Jonathan Stephens asked a retired former senior civil servant to consider the complaint. His conclusions were that the review was handled entirely properly, but that the figure used in the Westminster debate on 12 April 2016 for the cost of introducing NDM (£475m) was wrongly attributed to the Holmes review, whereas it was an MOD estimate. The error was repeated in a Written Parliamentary Answer on 25 April 2016. Colonel Scriven was informed of the outcome and sent a copy of the report by letter dated 28 July 2017. In that letter Sir Jonathan Stephens apologised for the error of attribution and indicated that the parliamentary record would be set straight. He concluded ‘I am afraid I will not be able to correspond further with you on this issue. As you know, the Minister decided in July 2014 not to introduce a National Defence Medal. That remains the position and unless, or until, there is change of policy there will be nothing more to add.’ 24. Colonel Scriven wrote again to Sir Jonathan Stephens on 15 January 2018. He asserted that the investigation and its conclusions were flawed. His letter requests either that the military medal review is reopened or that the matter is referred to the parliamentary ombudsman for an in-depth evaluation of the whole process, with a view to reopening the review. Request, Decision Notice and appeal Request 25. This appeal concerns the following request made on 10 January 2016: With regards to the KOREA POST-ARMISTICE Military Medals Review headed by Sir John Holmes, I would appreciate it if you would provide me with the following information: 1. The names of the individuals and/or veterans associations with whom the Military Medals Review Team (“Review Team”) of the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals Committee (“HD Committee”) consulted. 72. A list and copies of documents provided to the HD Committee and the Review Team at its meetings pertaining to the Post-Armistice Korea Medal review. 3. Specifically, whether the HD Committee, the Review Team and Brigadier B.A.H. Parritt, CBE were provided with a copy of the Australian working party report entitled Report of the Post-Armistice Korean Service Review? 4. Specifically, whether the members of the HD Committee or the Review Team and Brigadier Parritt were provided with a copy of the submissions sent to Sir John Holmes entitled KOREA POST-ARMISTICE 28 July 1953-26 July 1957. This document was submitted to Sir John Holmes at the outset of Phase 1 of his enquiry. 5. Copies of minutes and/or notes taken at meetings of the HD Committee and the Review Team indicating what was discussed at those meetings that led to the decision by the HD Committee that there should be no retrospective issue of a British Korea Medal or clasp for service in Korea after the ceasefire on 26 July 1953. 6. Whether a vote was taken by committee members to determine whether or not to issue a medal/clasp? If so, what was the result of the vote FOR and AGAINST. Reply and review 26. The Cabinet Office responded on 29 January 2016. It did not hold some of the information. In relation to the information that it held, it refused the request on the basis of s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b). It upheld its decision on internal review on 4 March 2016. Mr Farrar referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 14 March 2016. Decision Notice 27. In a decision notice dated 1 November 2016 the Commissioner decided that the Cabinet Office did not hold any information within the scope of the request that related to the review team. In relation to the rest of the information, the Commissioner decided that s 35(1)(a) and s 37(1)(b) were engaged. Under s 37(1)(b), the Commissioner held that the competing public interests were finely balanced. In relation to some of the information the Commissioner decided that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the public interest in maintaining the exemption. In relation to some of the information the Commissioner decided that the public interest in disclosure was outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the exemption. The Commissioner drew a distinction between information that recorded confidential discussions and was created in a safe space compared to information that did not record confidential discussions in relation to which safe space and chilling effect arguments were weak. 28. Under s 35(1)(a) the Commissioner decided that the balance of public interest was the same as identified under s 37. 829. The Commissioner decided that the Cabinet Office should have provided a link to the publicly available Brigadier Parritt review. 30. The Commissioner ordered disclosure of some of the information, as identified in a closed annex to her decision notice. Notice of Appeal 31. The Cabinet Office appealed the Commissioner’s decision notice. It does not challenge the decision in relation to Brigadier Parritt’s review. The grounds of appeal are: 31.1. Ground 1: The Commissioner’s exercise of discretion was wrong. 31.2. Ground 2: It was an error of law to take account of Mr Farrar’s complaint that the HD Committee and medal-decision making process is generally perceived to operate in a non-transparent manner. Ground 1 – exercise of discretion 32. The Commissioner was wrong to take account of the different approaches of other Commonwealth countries. 33. There is a heightened public interest in ensuring that the HD Committee’s deliberations are full, frank and confidential compared with the AMSC. Greater weight should therefore be given to the safe space. The Commissioner was wrong to take the approach that material held in relation to the HD Committee based on disclosed AMSC material can and should be disclosed. Ground 2 – error of law 34. The Commissioner erred in placing weight on a general concern that the HD Committee and the medal decision-making process was not transparent. This is not a factor which can properly be considered in determining whether the public interest balance was in favour of disclosure or against it. It was an error of law to take account of general criticisms of the medal decision-making process rather than specific public-interest factors in relation to the Korean Post-Armistice Medal. 35. Further, Mr Farrar’s allegation that the process has been ‘largely invisible’ significantly overstates the extent to which considerations have been kept private. It was an error of law to have found this to be a persuasive point. The Commissioner’s response 36. The Commissioner’s response dated 30 January 2017 submits that: 36.1. It was not inappropriate to take account of the different approach in other Commonwealth countries. The prima facie discrepancy gives rise to a legitimate public interest in understanding the reason for it. Disclosure of 9the disputed information would inform enable more informed public debate. 36.2. To the extent that there is a greater need for a safe space in the HD Committee there is a greater countervailing public interest in the disclosure of its discussions. 36.3. Where information was genuinely created in a safe space, the Commissioner found this to be a decisive factor in favour of withholding the information. 36.4. The First Tier Tribunal in Halligan (EA/2015/0291) did not draw a hard and fast distinction between the AMSC and the HD Committee. There is no rule that minutes of the AMSC fall to be disclosed and those of the HD Committee do not. The Tribunal criticised the Cabinet Offices’ apparent blanket policy of non-disclosure of that material. 36.5. HD Committee minutes have no special status. Civil servants on the HD Committee will be no less robust than those on the AMSC Committee. 36.6. If there are well-founded concerns that a particular decision-making process is less transparent than it should be, then there is an enhanced public interest in disclosure of information which would render that process more accountable. 36.7. The Decision Notice in FS50303365 is not binding and does not support the submission made by the Cabinet Office. Mr Farrar’s response dated 10 February 2017 37. Mr Farrar makes the following points: 37.1. It was appropriate to take the approach of other Commonwealth Nations into account. 37.2. The reasoning of the First Tier Tribunal in Halligan EA/2015/0291 should apply to the HD Committee as well. 37.3. Mr Farrar believes that the AMSC was not provided with all the relevant documentation and did not consult adequately. Disclosure of the AMSC minutes is essential because there are concerns about the rigour of the discussions that took place. 37.4. It was appropriate to take account of concerns about transparency in the light of the Prime Minister’s promise for greater openness and transparency in government. 37.5. Stage two of the medal review process was not open and transparent. 37.6. Mr Farrar submitted a rebuttal to Brigadier Parritt’s review which he believes was not provided to the AMSC. 37.7. There are doubts about the AMSC’s independence from the Ministry of Defence. 37.8. The Deputy Prime Minister, in a letter to Colonel Scriven on the subject of NDM, stated: …I agree with you that the HD Committee should do more to achieve transparency and accountability so that veterans can understand fully the decisions taken. 1037.9. It is difficult to understand why the reasons and justification for the decision on Korea post-Armistice medallic recognition should be kept secret. 37.10. The inconsistency of approach with other Commonwealth countries calls for an explanation. 37.11. Disclosure of the information would enable a more informed public debate on these issues. The Cabinet Office’s reply dated 27 February 2017 38. The Cabinet Office makes the following points: 38.1. It confirms that it agrees with the Commissioner in relation to the information which the Commissioner held should not be disclosed. 38.2. Australia, New Zealand and Canada are separate sovereign states which happen to be members of the Commonwealth. Their different medallic recognition policies are entirely irrelevant to the question of the public interest balance. 38.3. It is wrong to submit that any greater need to afford a safe space to the HD Committee is countervailed by a greater public interest in disclosure and contradicts para 3 of the confidential annex. 38.4. A complaint about general lack of transparency should have been given very little, if any weight. 38.5. The impartiality or otherwise of the chair of the AMSC is not relevant the appeal. Mr Farrar’s reply dated 3 March 2017 39. Mr Farrar submits that the impartiality of the chair of the AMSC is relevant. It is a vital aspect of the public interest to be able to demonstrate that the process was fair and unbiased. Legal framework 40. The relevant parts of s 1 and 2 of the FOIA provide: General right of access to information held by public authorities. 1(1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. Effect of the exemptions in Part II. ....... 2(2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or 11(b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 41. Section 35(1)(a) of FOIA provides as follows: 35 Formulation of government policy, etc. (1) Information held by a government department or by the Welsh Assembly government is exempt information if it relates to— (a) the formulation or development of government policy 42. The question of whether the policy-making process is still ‘live’ is an issue that goes to the assessment of the public interest balancing test (Morland v Cabinet Office [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC). 43. The inter-section between the timing of the FOIA request and its relevance to the public interest balancing test is helpfully analysed by the First-tier Tribunal in Department for Education and Skills v Information Commissioner and the Evening Standard (EA/2006/0006) (“DFES”) at paragraph 75(iv)-(v) (a decision approved in Office of Government Commerce v Information Commissioner [2008] EWHC 774 (Admin); [2010] QB 98 (“OGC”) at paragraphs 79 and 100-101): (iv) The timing of a request is of paramount importance to the decision. We fully accept the DFES argument, supported by a wealth of evidence, that disclosure of discussions of policy options, whilst policy is in the process of formulation, is highly unlikely to be in the public interest, unless, for example, it would expose wrongdoing within government. Ministers and officials are entitled to time and space, in some instances to considerable time and space, to hammer out policy by exploring safe and radical options alike, without the threat of lurid headlines depicting that which has been merely broached as agreed policy. We note that many of the most emphatic pronouncements on the need for confidentiality to which we were referred, are predicated on the risk of premature publicity. In this case it was a highly relevant factor in June 2003 but of little, if any, weight in January 2005. (v) When the formulation or development of a particular policy is complete for the purposes of (iv) is a question of fact. However, s. 35(2) and to a lesser extent 35(4), clearly assume that a policy is formulated, announced and, in many cases, superseded in due course. We think that a parliamentary statement announcing the policy, of which there are examples in this case, will normally mark the end of the process of formulation. There may be some interval before development. We do not imply by that that any public interest in maintaining the exemption disappears the moment that a minister rises to his or her feet in the House. We repeat – each case must be decided in the light of all the circumstances. As is plain however, we do not regard a “seamless web” approach to policy as a helpful guide to the question whether discussions on formulation are over. 44. The public interest can wax and wane and the need for a safe space changes over time in relation to development of policy. If disclosure is likely to intrude 12upon the safe space then there will, in general terms, be significant public interest in maintaining the exemption, but this has to be assessed on a case by case basis. 45. S 37 FOIA provides where relevant as follows: 37 Communications with Her Majesty, etc. and honours. (1) Information is exempt information if it relates to – … (b) the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity. 46. Sections 35 and 37 are not absolute exemptions. The Tribunal must consider if, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 47. In considering the factors that militate against disclosure the primary focus should be on the particular interest which the exemption is designed to protect, in the case of s 35 this is the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy (see e.g. para 57 in the FTT decision in HM Treasury v ICO EA/2007/0001). 48. The Upper Tribunal in Morland v Cabinet Office [2018] UKUT 67 (AAC) held that: …the purpose of section 37 itself is to protect the fundamental constitutional principle that communications between the Queen and her ministers are essentially confidential. Section 37(1)(a)-(ad)…specifically protects the actual communications with the Sovereign and certain other members of the Royal Family and the Royal Household. Section 37(1)(b) must be concerned with activities other than communications with the Sovereign. The logical purpose of section 37(1)(b) is to ensure candour and protect confidences in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and medals. 49. The balance of public interest should be assessed as it stood at the time of the outcome of the internal review (Savic v ICO AGO and CO [2016] UKUT 0534 (AAC) at para 10). 50. The APPGER case gives guidance on how the balancing exercise required by section 2(2)(b) of FOIA should be carried out: … when assessing competing public interests under FOIA the correct approach is to identify the actual harm or prejudice that the proposed disclosure would (or would be likely to or may) cause and the actual benefits its disclosure would (or would be likely to or may) confer or promote. This … requires an appropriately detailed identification of, proof, explanation and examination of both (a) the harm or prejudice, and (b) benefits that the proposed disclosure of the relevant material in respect of which the exemption is claimed would (or would be likely to or may) cause or promote. 1351. The public interest is not the same as being of interest to the public. 52. When a qualified exemption is engaged, there is no presumption in favour of disclosure. The proper analysis is that, if, after assessing the competing public interests for and against disclosure having regard to the content of the specific information in issue, the Tribunal concludes that the competing interests are evenly balanced, we will not have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption (against disclosure) outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (as section 2(2)(b) requires) (Department of Health v Information Commission and another [2017] EWCA Civ 374). The role of the Tribunal 53. The Tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the Tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Evidence and submissions 54. The Tribunal was provided with a number of bundles of documents which it took account of where relevant. Cabinet Office submissions dated 20 April 2018 55. The overall purpose of s 37 as a whole is to protect the fundamental constitutional principle that communications between the Queen and her advisors are essentially confidential. This heightens the importance of a safe space for discussion when considering the public interest balance in relation to s 37(1)(b). Submissions of Mr Farrar dated 4 May 2018 56. The youngest member of the armed forces who served in post-Armistice Korea is 80. It is in the public interest for maximum transparency on the subject to be provided. 57. The Agreed guidelines on the conditions and the criteria surrounding the award of Military Campaign Medals and related issues (‘the Guidelines’) issued in October 2014 provide: …there is at the same time a need to maintain a degree of consistency between British practices and those of allies and friends, with whom military deployments have been made and will continue to be made, to avoid a sense of injustice on the part of British 14service personnel and veterans compared to others with whom they have served in the same campaigns. 58. Correspondence from the MoD and the Cabinet Office show that they considered that decisions by other Commonwealth countries had no bearing on the decision the British Government might make under similar circumstances. This suggests that the guidelines were ignored by the HD Committee. It is in the public interest to know if the HD Committee was provided with the Guidelines, if not, why not, and why they were not followed. 59. All five factors set out in para 4 of the Guidelines concerning exposure to a significant degree of risk were present post-Armistice. It is in the public interest to know if these factors were taken into account by the HD Committee in reaching its decision on the Korea post-Armistice medal. 60. It is in the public interest to know why the Cabinet Office wishes to keep this information out of the public domain. It is of public interest to know why the British practice is contradictory to the medallic recognition by Commonwealth allies for the same service. 61. Veterans were promised an open and transparent medal review. They do not know what information the HD Committee had before it in relation to the Korea post-Armistice medal. This information should be disclosed so they can understand why their service has not been recognised. The Commissioner’s submissions dated 22 May 2018 62. The Commissioner accepts that the constitutional principle underpinning s 37 heightens the importance of a safe space for discussion. The Commissioner drew a distinction between information that recorded confidential discussions which the Commissioner found to be created in a safe space and to be exempt from disclosure and information that did not record confidential discussions, in relation to which safe space and chilling effect arguments were weak. Where information does not record a confidential discussion, it does not engage the constitutional principle. Discussions and Conclusions The scope of the appeal 63. We have had no evidence or submissions in relation to (a) the conclusion by the Commissioner that the Cabinet Office did not hold certain information and (b) the conclusion by the Commissioner that the Cabinet Office was entitled to withhold certain information. 64. For the reasons set out below, we have concluded that the Decision Notice is wrong in law because we have assessed the public interest balance differently 15and decided that the Cabinet Office is entitled to withhold certain information which the Commissioner decided should be disclosed. We must therefore issue a fresh Decision Notice. In making this fresh decision it is our view that we are required to look at all the issues that arise out of the request and our jurisdiction is not limited to those challenged on appeal. 65. The Decision Notice decided that the Cabinet Office did not hold information relating to the independent review team. We have heard no submissions on this point. We note that paragraph 43 of the First Tier Tribunal’s decision in Davies v Information Commissioner and the Cabinet Office EA/2017/0006 provides compelling reasons for that tribunal’s conclusion that the Cabinet Office did on the balance of probabilities hold information relating to the independent review team. The date of the request is later in this case, and therefore this difference does not affect the reasoning in Davies. We are not bound by the decision in Davies, but we find that the facts in this case are materially identical and that the reasons for that tribunal’s decision are persuasive and compelling. On this basis we conclude that the Cabinet Office did, on the balance of probabilities, hold information relating to the independent review team. 66. We are conscious that we have not had submissions or evidence on this point from any of the parties. We considered whether it would be in accordance with the overriding objective to seek submissions or evidence from the parties on this issue before making a decision. We concluded, in the light of the time that this case has already taken, that it would not be proportionate or in the interests of justice to delay the case further. The Cabinet Office and the Commissioner had the opportunity to make submissions on this identical point in the case of Davies. Mr Farrar suffers no prejudice because it is a decision in his favour. Further, we have ordered that the Cabinet Office either disclose the information or issue a new s 17 response in relation to this aspect of the claim. This gives the Cabinet Office the opportunity to review its position in the light of Davies, and to raise any points specific to this particular case that it would have raised in submissions. 67. In relation to the information which Commissioner decided could be withheld, we consider that we are fully aware of the arguments that the Cabinet Office would make in relation to this part of the minutes. The Cabinet Office does not take a contents-based approach and therefore its submissions apply equally to all the requested material relating to the HD Committee. The Commissioner’s position is set out fully in relation to this material in the Decision Notice and in her submissions. Mr Farrar has not seen the material and therefore his submissions, by necessity, are intended to apply across the board. We therefore conclude that it is proportionate and in the interests of justice to proceed on the basis of the information before us and we consider afresh where the public interest balance lies in relation to all the information. 16The scope of the request 68. Neither the Commissioner nor the Cabinet Office appear to have considered whether the scope of the request was limited to information relating to the decision taken by the HD Committee relating to the Korea post-Armistice Medal Review. 69. We find that the request in paragraph 2 for ‘[a] list and copies of documents provided to the HD Committee […] at its meetings pertaining to the Post- Armistice Korea Medal review’ is not limited to documents relating to that particular medal. ‘Pertaining to’ refers to the meetings, rather than the documents. 70. In contrast we find that the request for minutes in paragraph 5 is limited to the sections of the minutes which indicate ‘what was discussed at those meetings that led to the decision by the HD Committee that there should be no retrospective issue of a British Korea Medal or clasp for service in Korea after the ceasefire on 26 July 1953.’ 71. In relation to the rest of the request, we find that the wording of the paragraphs makes it clear that the scope is not so limited. Aggregation 72. We have looked at the aggregate effect of the s 35 and s 37 exemptions in an impressionistic rather than a mathematical way, considering where the different exemptions add weight and, conversely, where they overlap. While carrying out this exercise we have kept in mind the different interests protected by the different exemptions. The relevant date at which to assess the public interest 73. The public interest balance has to be assessed at the time of the request or at the latest at the date of the outcome of the internal review which took place in this case on 4 March 2016. The Tribunal cannot take account of matters that have happened since then, save where they shed light on the position at the relevant date. A contents-based approach 74. In our view it is not appropriate to assess the public interest in relation to a particular category of document (here, for example, ‘minutes of the HD Committee’), irrespective of content. We find the following paragraphs in the Upper Tribunal’s judgment in Department of Health v Information Commissioner [2015] UKUT 159 to be of assistance in relation to a contents- based approach to public interest: 1730. So a contents based assertion of the public interest against disclosure has to show that the actual information is an example of the type of information within the class description of an exemption (e.g. formulation of policy or Ministerial communications or the operation of a Ministerial private office), and why the manner in which disclosure of its contents will cause or give rise to a risk of actual harm to the public interest. It is by this route that: i) the public interest points relating to the class descriptions of the qualified exemptions, and so in maintaining the exemptions, are engaged (e.g. conventions relating to collective responsibility and Law Officers’ advice) and applied to the contents of the information covered by the exemption, and ii) the wide descriptions of (and so the wide reach of) some of the qualified exemptions do not result in information within that description or class that does not in fact engage the reasoning on why disclosure would cause or give rise to risk of actual harm (e.g. anodyne discussion) being treated in the same way as information that does engage that reasoning because of its content (e.g. examples of full and frank exchanges). 31. That contents approach will also highlight the timing issues that relate to the safe space argument. The timing issues are different to the candour or chilling effect arguments in that significant aspects of them relate to the likelihood of harm from distracting and counterproductive discussion based on disclosure before a decision is made. 32. Finally, I record that I agree that a contents approach does not mean that the information is not considered as a package (see Foreign and Commonwealth Office v Information Commissioner and Plowden [2013] UKUT 275 (AAC) at [16]). Indeed, such a consideration accords with the nature of a contents-based assessment because it reflects the meaning and effect of the content of the relevant information. 75. These parts of the judgment remain binding on us. Further the Court of Appeal [2017] EWCA Civ 374 approved a contents-based approach at para 46 (my emphasis): I agree with Charles J that, when a qualified exemption is engaged, there is no presumption in favour of disclosure; and that the proper analysis is that, if, after assessing the competing public interests for and against disclosure having regards to the content of the specific information in issue, the decision-maker concludes that the competing interests are evenly balanced, he or she will not have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemption (against disclosure) outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (as section 2(2)(b) requires.) 76. We note the decision in Plowden referred to by the Upper Tribunal above, and we look at the information in context, i.e. on the basis that it appears in the minutes of discussions of the HD Committee. However, this does not mean that we must treat the document as a whole without regard to its contents. The FOIA regime is concerned with information not documents. When considering the public interest, we must look at the particular information contained in the 18document (see e.g. paras 33-36, DBERR v Information Commissioner and Friends of the Earth EA/2007/0072. 77. Further, we note that some of the information contained in the documents relates to different matters which were at different stages of ‘liveness’ at the date of the request. This makes it difficult to assess the public interest in disclosing or not disclosing the document as a whole. Timing and the public interest 78. The question of the timing of the request is important because of the risks of the adverse effects of premature publicity on the particular interest which s 35 is intended to protect: the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy. 79. We do not consider that the question of the ‘liveness’ of a policy nor the question of the effect on the public interest should be seen as binary. Looking firstly at the effect on the public interest, it is clear that the public interest waxes and wanes with the circumstances: it is not a question of any public interest in maintaining a safe space disappearing the moment a policy is announced. The corollary of this, in our view, is that a policy’s liveness can also wax and wane. We do not accept that the policy development process should be seen a seamless web, because this suggests that the policy development process is always live. Nor do we accept that a policy development process is necessarily ‘dead’ the moment a policy is announced publicly. 80. All the circumstances must be taken into account in order to assess, at the relevant point in time, whereabouts on the spectrum the facts fall: a policy in the very early stages of development or at a critical point in its development process would fall near the live end of the spectrum and consequently the weight of the public interest in maintaining the exemption would be much greater. A policy which is announced with no intention of further work would fall near the other end of the spectrum. Somewhere in between lie policies which have been ‘placed on the backburner’, or that are due to be reviewed after a certain period of time. The policy development process does not move smoothly from one end of the spectrum to the other – as stated above, its ‘liveness’ waxes and wanes. The task for the Tribunal is to consider, taking into account the facts before it on the state of policy development at the relevant date, what impact the disclosure of this particular information at the relevant time might have on the particular interest of protecting the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation of government policy. 81. The information requested by Mr Farrar contains reference to other claims for medallic recognition, including the NDM. 1982. On the facts we find that, at the relevant time, there was no ongoing process of substantive policy formulation and development on whether or not to introduce the NDM. The question of whether, at some point, that process would be rekindled was explicitly left open. On occasion, the decision on whether or not to re-open that substantive process was considered and taken. For example, the question of whether or not to re-open the process was considered and taken at the meeting of the HD Committee on 23 February 2015. We also accept that it was likely that the question of whether or not to re-open the substantive discussion on NDM would have to be considered again in the future. Further there were related discussions and decisions as to how to respond to correspondence on the issue from the campaign. 83. In relation to the other claims for medallic recognition the government had made clear that, absent significant new evidence of injustice, there would be no reconsideration of the claims. This was confirmed in relation to the Korea post-Armistice medal in, for example, the letter to Mr Farrar from Gareth Rogers in the Honours and Appointments Secretariat dated 29 October 2015 which states: ‘I can confirm that there are no plans for further work on this issue.’ 84. Leaving aside the broader chilling effect arguments, which we consider below, we have asked ourselves whether, in the light of all the circumstances, the efficient, effective and high-quality formulation and development of government policy would be harmed or prejudiced by disclosure of this information in March 2016. In relation to the information which relates to the Korea post-Armistice medal and other medallic claims we consider that the risk to the future policy development process by their disclosure in March 2016 rather than at a later date is extremely small, and we conclude that this adds little weight to the public interest in maintaining the exemption. These matters had been concluded in July 2014 with extremely limited opportunity for re- opening the issue. We do not think there is any risk of an adverse impact on the related subordinate policy development issues i.e. the question of whether or not to re-open the issue, or on how to respond to correspondence from the campaigners. 85. In relation to the NDM, the government had left the door open in July 2014, but only by a crack. Any consideration which had taken place between 2015 and 2017 had not been a substantive reconsideration of the matters discussed at the meetings on 29 January 2014 and 9 June 2014. There is a slim chance that the matter will be substantively re-opened, and if so, a slim chance that the issues would remain so similar that revealing certain aspects of the discussions in 2014 would have an adverse impact on policy development. We find that this adds some, but limited, additional weight to the public interest balance in relation to the sections which we have decided should be redacted. In relation to the matters which we have decided should be disclosed, we do not think that there is more than a negligible risk that disclosure of this particular 20information would have such an adverse impact. We do not think there is any risk of an adverse impact on the related subordinate policy development issues i.e. the question of whether or not to re-open the issue, or on how to respond to correspondence from the campaigners. The public interest under s 37 and s 35 86. The purpose of s 37(1)(b) is to ensure candour and protect confidences in the entire process of considering honours, dignities and medals. We accept that the HD Committee is a Committee that makes recommendations that are put before The Queen. We accept that underlying s 37 as a whole is the fundamental constitutional principle that communications with The Queen are confidential. 87. We do not accept that this means that minutes of the HD Committee or the documents put before it should never be disclosed. In our view, the content and context of the information will affect the public interest balance. Where the information contains or reveals confidential information or candid discussions, the public interest in maintaining the exemption will be stronger. Where that confidential information or those candid discussions result directly in recommendations to The Queen, the public interest in maintaining the exemption will be stronger. 88. We accept in relation to some of the requested information that it consists of confidential information or candid discussions. Some of it, in relation to specific claims for medallic recognition, results in recommendations that are put before The Queen. We accept that revealing that information might compromise the candour of future discussions. We find that this carries significant weight in the public interest balance. 89. We accept that this effect on the candour of future discussions might also have an adverse effect on future policy formulation under s 35 in this area, in terms of a more general chilling effect. There is a greater expectation of confidentiality in this sphere compared with other areas of policy development because of the role of The Sovereign and the underlying constitutional principle. We are therefore prepared to accept the risk of a chilling effect, even taking account of the robustness expected of civil servants. We find that the s 35 ‘chilling effect’ mainly overlaps with the matters set out above and therefore only adds limited additional weight. It does however add some weight: it is policy that is being discussed rather than a one-off decision on whether to award an individual a medal, and that has been statutorily recognised as a particular interest which is worthy of specific protection under s 35. 90. In relation to the rest of the information, we do not accept that revealing the information could compromise the candour of future discussions. It is either a fairly anodyne description of the issues and an outline of the action that would 21be taken, or it is information the substance of which is already in the public domain. We conclude that the public interest in maintaining the exemptions, taken together, in relation to this part of the information is very limited. 91. In terms of the public interest in disclosure there are many matters raised in this case, and the other cases we heard at the same time, that we do not think weigh in the balance, because they are not interests that would in fact be served by the disclosure of the particular information. 92. We find that the following matters add weight to the public interest in disclosure. 93. Firstly, whilst we accept that much other information relating to the medals process has now been put in the public domain, we find that the general public interest in transparency in decision making in the medals process is heightened because the process was said, in the Holmes Report, to be ‘vulnerable to the charge of being a “black box” operation, where those outside have no knowledge of what is being decided or why’. It is clear that matters have moved on since the Holmes Report to some extent, but we find that there remains an enhanced general public interest in transparency in relation to the operation of the entire process. We do not accept that this it is an error of law to take this factor into account. 94. Secondly, we accept that there are a large number of people affected by the claims for medallic recognition that were considered in these meetings and there is consequently a substantial public interest in knowing how those matters were finally concluded. This has a greater weight in relation to a full set of unredacted documents, and we find that this interest will be only be served to a fairly limited extent by the disclosure of the remaining information. 95. Thirdly, we accept that there is a legitimate interest in those people affected by the 21 claims that the AMSC agreed did not need to be subject to detailed review by the independent review team in knowing what discussions took place in relation to their claims when they came before the HD Committee. Again, whilst this has more significant weight in relation to the full, unredacted minutes, it will only be served to a much more limited extent in relation to the disclosed sections. 96. Finally we accept that there is some public interest in knowing the HD Committee’s approach to the relevance of the medals awarded in similar circumstances by other Commonwealth nations, in the light of the correspondence that suggest that this is an irrelevant factor compared to the guidance later adopted by the HD Committee which suggests that this is a relevant factor. Having reviewed the closed information in full, we conclude that neither the disclosure of a full set of unredacted information nor the disclosure of the remaining information will cast any significant light on this 22issue and consequently it does not add materially to the public interest in disclosure. 97. Overall, we find that there is a significant public interest in the disclosure of the full information and a more limited public interest in disclosure of the remaining information. 98. Despite the significant public interest in disclosure of the full set of minutes/documents set out above, we conclude that for certain sections this is outweighed by a very strong public interest in maintaining the exemption. We have set out in summary our reasons for concluding that there is a very strong interest above. 99. There are some sections of the minutes or documents which do not relate to matters arising out of the military medal review. In relation to those sections we have concluded that the public interest arguments in favour of disclosure set out above do not apply. On the other hand, some of the arguments in favour of maintaining the exemptions are of more general application. In relation to these sections of the minutes we have concluded that the public interest favours maintaining the exemptions. 100. In relation to the rest of the information we have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exemptions is very limited. For the reasons set out above we have concluded that there is some public interest in disclosure of this information and in our view, it outweighs the very limited public interest in maintaining the exemption. 101.

This appeal arises from a letter of request from Mr Fisher, the Appellant, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) to the Department of Work and Pensions (“DWP”) dated 20 April 2008. The request concerned the Health & Safety at Work (Offences) Bill (now an Act) and in particular the proposed legislative change to impose a term of imprisonment for certain offences. These are offences in relation to which the statutory defence has a reverse burden of proof. The focus of the request was whether the introduction of imprisonment for these offences would entail a breach of article 6, the right to a fair trial, under the European Convention of Human Rights. The part of the request under appeal is : “Any document or legal opinion which contains the opinion of the dept of the DWP referred to in para 21 of the explanatory notes”. The reference to paragraph 21 was to a statement in the Explanatory Notes to this Bill stating that in the DWP’s view, the proposed change was compliant with human rights. Paragraph 21 stated: ""The Department for Work and Pensions is of the opinion that, in making imprisonment available as a potential penalty for an offence to which the reverse burden applies, the Bill is compatible with Article 6 of the ECHR, in that it strikes a fair balance between the fundamental right of the individual and the general interests of the community..."" 2. The DWP identified one document which it said represented the ‘settled’ legal advice giving rise to the Minister’s opinion for the purposes of paragraph 21 of the Explanatory Notes. It initially refused disclosure in a letter dated 16 June 2008. On internal review, dated 23 October 2008 it upheld its decision not to release the information placing reliance on the exemption under section 42 FOIA relating to legal professional privilege. Mr Fisher complained to the Information Commissioner (“IC”). Following his investigation, the IC served a -3-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 Decision Notice dated 2 February 2010 upholding the refusal to disclose the information (“the disputed information”). He appealed this decision to the First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) (“the Tribunal”). 3. Mr Fisher’s appeal fell into three main grounds of appeal: (a) The IC had erred in accepting that the disputed information was subject to legal professional privilege; rather the Minister had ‘adopted’ the legal advice contained in the disputed information and thereby it had either become his opinion and was therefore not subject to legal professional privilege or had lost its status of being legally professionally privileged through waiver; (b) The IC had erred in identifying the factors to be taken into account in considering the application of the public interest test; (c) The IC had erred in attributing weight to those factors. 4. In light of this, the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the essential questions were: (a) Was section 42 engaged ie: was the disputed information subject to legal professional privilege; (b) If so, where did the public interest lay, in favour of disclosing the information or maintaining the exemption? Evidence 5. Before the Tribunal was a bundle of papers including evidence as to the passage of the Bill through Parliament, Cabinet Office Guidance on Making Legislation, section 19 statements (see below), and as to the way in which his request and the subsequent IC investigation had been handled. -4-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 6. The Tribunal was provided with a copy of the disputed information. This was not however disclosed to Mr Fisher during the proceedings as to have done so would have been to defeat the purpose of the appeal. 7. There was no witness evidence. The Law 8. This Tribunal’s jurisdiction in relation to appeals is pursuant to section 58 of FOIA. For the purposes of this appeal, the Tribunal must consider whether the Decision Notice is in accordance with law. The starting point is the Decision Notice itself but the Tribunal is free to review findings of fact made by the IC and to receive and hear evidence which is not limited to that before the IC. In cases involving the so-called public interest test in section 2(2)(b), as here, a mixed question of law and fact is involved. If the Tribunal comes to a different conclusion under section 2(2)(b) on the same or differently decided facts, that will lead to a finding that the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. 9. Section 42, which is contained in Part II of FOIA, provides: “(1) Information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege….could be maintained in legal proceedings is exempt information”. 10. In determining whether the section 42 exemption is engaged, the Tribunal had regard to the scope of legal professional privilege. A differently constituted Information Tribunal in the case of Bellamy v IC & Secretary of State for Trade and Industry EA/2005/0023 provided the following guidance as to the scope of legal professional privilege, which we adopt: “9. In general, the notion of legal professional privilege can be described as a set of rules or principles which are designed to protect the confidentiality of legal or legally related communications and exchanges between the client and his, or its lawyers, as well as -5-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 exchanges which contain or refer to legal advice which might be imparted to the client, and even exchanges between the clients and their parties if such communications or exchanges come into being for the purposes of preparing for litigation. A further distinction has grown up between legal advice privilege and litigation privilege. Again, in general terms, the former covers communications relating to the provision of legal advice, whereas the latter, as the term suggests, encompasses communications which might include exchanges between those parties, where the sole or dominant purpose of the communications is that they relate to any litigation which might be in contemplation, quite apart from where it is already in existence”. 11. It is not in dispute in this appeal that only legal advice privilege as opposed to litigation privilege, is relevant – there was no litigation ongoing or threatened at the relevant time. 12. After forming a view on whether legal professional privilege applies and section 42 is engaged, our task is to consider the public interest balancing test in section 2(2) of the Act. Section 2(2), provides: “In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that – ……. (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing information”. 13. To this end, the Tribunal must consider “all the circumstances of the case” and to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The Tribunal reminded itself that the way in which the public interest test in section 2(2) is set out creates a presumption in favour of disclosure. The burden of proof remains on the public authority to satisfy the Tribunal that the public interest in maintaining -6-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 the exemption outweighs the public interest in favour of disclosure (DFES v IC EA/2006/10 paragraphs 61 & 64). 14. Mr Justice Wynn Williams in the High Court case of DBERR v O’Brien & Information Commissioner [2009] EWHC upheld the Tribunal’s approach in recognising that there is a significant in-built weight of public interest in maintaining the exemption under section 42. This is on account of the fundamental importance attached to legal professional privilege and thereby the protection of free and frank communications between lawyers and their clients. The judge stated at paragraphs 41 and 53 of the judgement: “It is also common ground, however, that the task of the Tribunal, ultimately, is to apply the test formulated in section 2(2)(b). A person seeking information from a government department does not have to demonstrate that “exceptional circumstances” exist which justify disclosure. Section 42 is not to be elevated “by the back-door” to an absolute exemption. As [counsel for the IC] submits in her Skeleton Argument, it is for the public authority to demonstrate on the balance of probability that the scales weigh in favour of the information being withheld. That is as true of a case in which section 42 is being considered as it is in relation to a case which involves consideration of any qualified exemption under FOIA. Section 42 cases are different simply because the in-built public interest in non-disclosure itself carries significant weight which will always have to be considered in the balancing exercise once it is established that legal professional privilege attaches to the document in question. ……………………………….. The in-built public interest in withholding information to which legal professional privilege applies is acknowledged to command significant weight. Accordingly, the proper approach for the Tribunal was to acknowledge and give effect to the significant weight to be afforded to the exemption in any event; ascertain whether there were particular or further factors in the instant case which pointed to non-disclosure and then consider whether the features supporting disclosure (including the -7-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 underlying public interests which favoured disclosure) were of equal weight at the very least”. Thus, whilst it was not necessary for there to be “exceptional” factors in favour of disclosure, the in-built weight in the LPP exemption is such that it is “more difficult to show the balance lies in favour of disclosure” (“Pugh v Information Commissioner & MOD EA/2007/0055). Is section 42 engaged? 15. The Tribunal satisfied itself from a consideration of the disputed information that this was legal advice provided by a lawyer to his client. As such, subject to the question of waiver, it was clear that section 42 was engaged. The Tribunal could not see how the subsequent reliance by the Minister upon this legal advice could strip it of its original status as having been legally professionally privileged. It would have understood a criticism that there ought perhaps to have been another document which evidenced the Minister’s adoption of this advice, but this was a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Mr Fisher had agreed with the IC that the investigation and indeed the appeal proceed on the basis that the disputed information was properly the only information under consideration. As such this was not a matter dealt with in the Decision Notice. 16. That was not to say, however that there were not other documents which might have come within the scope of the letter of request. Indeed, the DWP, whilst maintaining that the disputed information was the only information within scope, told the Tribunal that there were other documents containing legal advice – just not the ‘settled’ legal advice of the Department. The Tribunal noted that Mr Fisher had another, recently made, FOIA request to the DWP which would not be hampered by the limited scope of what had been agreed to be the disputed information. 17. The question arose whether insofar as the Explanatory Note contained the legal advice contained in the disputed information this had led to a waiver of the legal professional privilege. The Tribunal noted however that waiver did -8-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 not, as a matter of law, apply to legal advice privilege (as here) – its application was restricted to litigation privilege. Moreover, even in the context of litigation, a mere reference to a privileged document does not amount to a waiver of privilege: Expandable Ltd and another v Rubin. Therefore, the reference to the “opinion” in paragraph 21 of the Explanatory Notes would not amount to a waiver in any event. 18. Mr Fisher sought in this regard to pray in aid rule 31.14 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The Tribunal was of the view that as there was no litigation ongoing this was not sufficiently relevant to affect its view that there had not been any waiver of the legal professional privilege in the disputed information. The Public Interest Test 19. The Tribunal reviewed the public interest factors considered by the IC and put forward during the appeal by the parties in order to assess whether a lawful decision had been made. Factors in favour of disclosure 20. The factors in favour of disclosing the requested information were in summary (i) Disclosure would help the public to better understand the legal and therefore the ‘intellectual’ basis, as Mr Fisher put it, for the DWP’s claim that the proposed legislative change was in compliance with the European Convention of Human Rights; the introduction of a sanction of imprisonment for an offence which contained a reverse burden of proof defence was a matter of considerable importance; (ii) Disclosure would promote accountability and transparency in relation to this particular exercise of Parliamentary scrutiny. Mr Fisher had originally understood that the Minister’s statement in the Explanatory Notes had been given further to the legal duty in section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998. This provides: -9-Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 “A Minister of the Crown in charge of a Bill in either House of Parliament must, before Second reading of the Bill – (a) make a statement to the effect that in his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention rights (“a statement of compatibility”): or (b) make a statement to the effect that although he is unable to make a statement of compatibility the Government nevertheless wishes the House to proceed with the Bill. (2) The statement must be in writing and be published in such a manner as the Minister making it considers appropriate.” The Tribunal noted that all that was required was a ‘statement’ of the Minister’s view as to compatibility, not the reasons for that view. It understood however from Cabinet Guidance that the Government had committed itself to providing details of its reasons in Explanatory Notes. The Bill was a Private Member’s and not a Government initiated Bill. As such, the Tribunal determined that section 19 did not apply as the Minister had not been “in charge” of the Bill. It accepted however that it was the Government’s practice, as a matter of policy, to make an equivalent statement in relation to Private Members’ Bills that it supported. In forming this view, the Tribunal took into account the Cabinet Office Guidance on Making Legislation. The Tribunal was of the view that the Minister’s opinion, given in the Explanatory Notes, albeit not further to the legal duty in section 19, was the Government voluntarily acting as if the section did apply. (iii) As a proposed legislative change it potentially affects a very large number of people. - 10 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 Factors against disclosure 21. The factors in favour of maintaining the exemption put forward by the DWP and supported by the IC were, in summary: (i) the inbuilt public interest accorded to legal professional privilege and thereby: <U+0083> the protection of the DWP’s ability to communicate freely with legal advisors to obtain advice; <U+0083> ensuring that decisions are made on the basis of fully informed and thorough legal advice; <U+0083> the preservation of the ability of the DWP and other Government departments/agencies to defend its decisions in the event of legal challenge; <U+0083> the preservation of the general concept of legal professional privilege. (ii) the fact that the disputed information consisted of legal advice which was considered still to be ‘live’ (in the sense of being relied upon at the relevant time). The Bill was at the relevant time still subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. The Tribunal did not accept however the contention of the DWP that there was a ‘litigation context’ to this advice. DWP put this on two bases, first that there was the possibility of judicial review against the Government aimed directly at the enactment of the Bill. Given the remoteness of this possibility (judicial review of legislation passing through Parliament was acknowledged to be difficult to imagine) the Tribunal discounted this basis for the argument. It also discounted the second basis, that is, the disputed information being - 11 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 used in someway in a human rights challenge during a criminal prosecution. The Tribunal noted that there had already been important cases before the courts on this human rights issue pre-dating the proposed legislation. The resolution of any such challenge during the criminal prosecutions would, in the Tribunal’s view, rather be influenced by argument around those previous cases and current legal advice – not the historical advice relied upon by the Government in passing the Bill. 22. The Tribunal accepted that the factors identified above did apply in this case, subject to the comments on weight below. Application of the public interest test 23. The Tribunal gave careful consideration to where the public interest lay. It noted that there were significant factors operating on both sides of the balance. The Tribunal was particularly concerned, whilst acknowledging the significant in-built public interest in maintaining the exemption in section 42, not thereby to, in effect, treat this exemption as absolute. 24. The starting point in section 42 cases was the significant weight to be given to the in-built public interest in maintaining the legal professional privilege exemption. In this case, there had been no witness evidence as to the potential impact disclosure of the disputed information might have on the importance of lawyers and clients communicating freely. The Tribunal accepted that no witness evidence was strictly required for it to take the in- built interest into account, but noted that this diminished its ability to assess whether any particular factors in this case either increased or diminished the ‘significant in-built weight’. 25. The Tribunal considered cases where disclosure had been ordered by previously constituted Tribunals, in particular Mersey Tunnel Users Association v Information Commissioner & Mersey Tunnel EA2007/0052, paragraph 45, where it was said: - 12 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 “Routine disclosure might lead to those consequences [reluctance to seek advice, poorer quality of decision making etc.]. But disclosure under FOIA can never be routine. The public interest balance, with its inbuilt weight in favour of maintaining the exemption, must be struck in the particular circumstances of each case”. 26. The Tribunal agreed with this view and was sceptical, in the absence of any evidence, as to the ‘floodgates’ type submissions being made by the IC and the DWP. Each case had to be looked at on its merits and public authorities should not assume that the existence of the section 42 exemption obviated the need for this exercise. 27. The Tribunal agreed with the IC and the DWP that in addition to the in-built weight to the public interest in maintaining the exemption under section 42, a specific further factor against disclosure was that the legal advice was, at the relevant time, ‘live’. At the date of the refusal, 16 June 2008, the Bill was still on its Parliamentary journey. The legal advice was moreover, at this date and at the date of internal review of the refusal, relatively recent. Thus, the Tribunal was of the view that the DWP and the IC in turn had been correct to treat this information as still being relied upon. This factor added to the in- built weight meant that, despite the Tribunal’s reservations set out above, there was considerable public interest in maintaining the exemption for legal professional privilege in this case. 28. In favour of disclosure, the Tribunal accepted the importance of the underlying human rights issue. This would heighten the public interest in the Minister’s opinion on compliance. The passage of legislation gives rise to a particular public interest in the integrity of Government statements as Parliamentary scrutiny is, of course, the most important way in which proposed legislation is rendered democratically accountable. This was not mere curiosity or a desire to better understand the statement on compatibility, it was rather a question of Ministerial accountability – what legal reasoning underpinned the Minister’s opinion? Did this substantiate the view given in the House? In this regard, the Tribunal noted that whilst the reasons given in - 13 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 the Explanatory Notes were relatively full, they did not refer to the leading case of R v Davies (David Janway) [2009] EWCA 2949. Reference had been made in Minister’s speech to this case subsequently in the House of Lords, however the letter of request referred to the Explanatory Notes and thereby the Minister’s statement made at that time. 29. That was not to say that the public ought to be able to see behind all Ministerial statements made during the Parliamentary passage of legislation to the supporting advice. This should, in the Tribunal’s view, be viewed as an exceptional set of circumstances, when one takes into account the ‘section 19 context’ (albeit not directly applying the Government had decided to act as if it did) and the importance of the reverse burden of proof to human rights. This gave rise to a particular public interest in understanding and testing the legitimacy of the Minister’s statement. Disclosure of the disputed information would render the Government further accountable in the exercise of this important and unusual function. 30. Also in favour of disclosure was the Tribunal’s view that there would be no actual prejudice in this case if the legal advice was disclosed. It noted that the disputed information did not go much beyond the content of the Explanatory Notes (although this had the effect of correspondingly lessening the public interest in the public better understanding the Minster’s reasoning). 31. The Tribunal’s reading of the disputed information moreover dispelled any fear that the public had been misled or that the legal reasoning in the Explanatory Notes was a misrepresentation. Although Mr Fisher had been careful not to allege any wrongdoing either intentional or inadvertent, nevertheless the Tribunal took it upon itself to consider this issue. This was not a factor in this case either for or against disclosure; it was rather a matter which the Tribunal wished to mention in order to provide reassurance to the Appellant. 32. Whilst not binding, the Tribunal found useful the indications from differently constituted Tribunals of the sorts of factors that might constitute a public - 14 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 interest in favour of disclosure that equalled or outweighed the significant in- built public interest arising in section 42 cases. Thus, in the case of Fuller v Information commissioner & Ministry of Justice EA/2008/0005, it was said at paragraph 12: “There will be some cases in which there could be stronger contrary interests; for example, if the privileged material discloses wrongdoing by or within the authority or a misrepresentation to the public of the advice received or an apparently irresponsible and wilful disregard of advice, which was merely uncongenial”. 33. A differently constituted Tribunal in the case of Calland v Information Commissioner & FSA EA/2007/0136 stated that “some clear, compelling and specific justification for disclosure must be shown, so as to outweigh the obvious interest in protecting communications between lawyer and client, which the client supposes to be confidential”. 34. The Tribunal acknowledged that the weight of public interest in favour of disclosure would, in the light of the High Court case of O’Brien, need to be of a strong nature in order to at least equal the significant in-built public interest arising from the legal professional privilege exemption. With due respect to the previously constituted Tribunals cited above, this Tribunal was of the view that the strong countervailing public interest in favour of disclosure would not necessarily need to arise from an individual specific factor of the gravity of the examples given, but could arise from a variety of public interests which, taken together were sufficiently compelling. In this case, had it not been for the ‘live’ nature of the disputed information, the Tribunal would have concluded that the factors in favour of disclosure were sufficient to at least equal those against. 35. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, the Tribunal was of the view that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure. - 15 -Appeal No.: EA/2010/0044 Conclusion 36. The Tribunal upheld the IC’s Decision Notice and dismissed the appeal. This had been a difficult decision to make and the public interests were nearly balanced. It was only the fact that the legal advice was ‘live’ at the relevant time that had tipped the balance against disclosure. The Tribunal wished to recommend to the DWP that, in considering Mr Fisher’s subsequent FOIA request, it consider its position in the light of this aspect of the Tribunal’s assessment of the public interest factors. Whilst not within the scope of this appeal, it wished to express its doubt that the ‘live’ nature of the disputed information could still be maintained at this point in time. 37.

"29","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0276 Decided without a hearing On 4 July 2019 Before JUDGE BUCKLEY PAUL TAYLOR MALCOLM CLARKE Between MARTIN ROSENBAUM Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE OF THE METROPOLIS Second Respondent INTERIM DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the appeal is allowed. The Commissioner should have concluded that the Second Respondent (‘the Police’) was not entitled to refuse to confirm or deny whether it held the information. 2. This interim decision deals only with the issue of whether or not the Police were entitled to refuse to confirm or deny whether they held the requested information. A further decision and, if appropriate, a substitute decision notice, will be issued 1once the tribunal has heard submissions from all parties on the applicability of any exemptions. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50755946 of 14 November 2018 which held that the Second Respondent (‘the Police’) was entitled to rely on s 23(5) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). 2. We have read and taken account of an open bundle of documents, a small closed bundle (containing an unredacted version of a letter in the open bundle), submissions from all parties and a witness statement on behalf of the Police from Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Southworth. Factual background to the appeal 3. The National Front is defined by the Police in their letter of 15 October 2018 as follows: ‘The National Front is a far-right and fascist political party. The party espouses the ethnic nationalist view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. The party calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and settled non-white Britons to be stripped of citizenship and deported from the country. A white supremacist group, it promotes biological racism, calling for global racial separatism and condemning interracial relationships and miscegenation. Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(UK) and http://www.nationalfront.info/‘ 4. In 2006 the functions of Special Branch were merged with the Anti-Terrorist Branch into a unit called the Counter Terrorism Command (‘CTC’), also known as S015. The tribunal read a statement from Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Southworth, in charge of the CTC. The CTC’s remit includes countering terrorism but also to combat threats to national security and to protect democracy from, for example, espionage, subversion, political extremism etc. This national security remit is shared with a number of s 23 bodies. The CTC’s most significant intelligence partner is the Security Service, and there is significant liaison between the CTC and the Security Service on a daily basis. Section 23 bodies are routinely involved in most aspects of CTC work and any information gathered by CTC may be exchanged with or originate from s 23 bodies. 5. The Police currently has a policy of neither confirming or denying the existence of material which would inform the public whether or not Special Branch have had an interest in a particular individual or organisation. While the witness statement makes reference to information in relation to any terrorist or extremist group or individual, the Tribunal understands that the policy applies to requests 2for information concerning any groups or people who may or may not have been of interest to Special Branch, where confirming or denying would reveal the investigative ambit of Special Branch. Historically, when the FOIA was first implemented, the Police released some information from Special Branch files in response to FOI requests. The Appellant identifies, for example, the release of information held in relation to certain groups in 2005 and 2006. 6. The BBC Documentary, ‘True Spies’, contained interviews from ex-Special Branch officers in which they state, for example, that Special Branch used an MI5 agent to infiltrate the National Front. The Police have not confirmed or denied anything that was said by the ex-officers. The Police issued the following press release about ‘True Spies’: “We assisted the BBC with its research on the subject, which is closely linked with the operational history of Special Branch. A number of ex-officers approached the Met asking for advice as to whether or not they should contribute, which we gave them. It is incumbent on them not to do anything that could compromise national security. However, ex-officers are private individuals and the final decision as to whether to give interviews is up to them.” 7. The Undercover Policing Enquiry has published a list identifying 78 organisations to enable members of the public to identify whether they may have known officers who were deployed undercover. The list is stated not to be a comprehensive list of groups with which the officer may have interacted and not to constitute a factual finding by the Chairman that any group was or was not targeted. The Police have not confirmed the accuracy of this list. Request 8. This appeal concerns the request made on 10 January 2018 by Martin Rosenbaum for the following information: “All information held by what was then called Special Branch relating to the National Front, for the following years: a) 1974 b) 1975 c) 1983 I am aware of the policy which has normally been adopted in recent years by the Metropolitan Police in relation to FOI requests relating to the work of Special Branch and FOIA section 23. However this policy can no longer be maintained in the same way, in the light of the recent decision of the Upper Tribunal in (1) Corderoy & (2) Ahmed v (1) IC, (2) A-G & (3) CO [2017] UKUT 495 (AAC) […] In my opinion the information I have requested could be ‘disaggregated’ (using the terminology of the UKUT decision) from material which is genuinely covered by section 23. It is therefore not exempt from disclosure for that reason.” [ …] 39. The Police’s reply, dated 12 February 2018, was received by Mr Rosenbaum on 22 March 2018. The Police refused to confirm or deny that it held the requested information citing sections 23(5), 24(2), 27(4), 30(3), 31(3) and 40(5) FOIA, because confirming or denying whether or not it held the information would disclose whether or not the Police have or have had an interest in the National Front and whether there has been any involvement of the security bodies. 10. Mr Rosenbaum applied for a review on 28 March 2018. On 25 May 2018 the Police upheld its decision. Decision Notice 11. In a decision notice dated 14 November 2018 the Commissioner decided that the Police was entitled to neither confirm not deny whether it held any information relying on s 23(5) (information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters). 12. The Commissioner concluded that (1) Corderoy & (2) Ahmed v (1) The Information Commissioner, (2)The Attorney-General & (3) The Cabinet Office [2017] UKUT 495 (AAC) (‘Corderoy’) was not relevant to this appeal. 13. The Commissioner held that s 23(5) is engaged if the wording of the request suggests that any information falling within its scope would be within the class described in this section. The evidence must suggest that it is probable that any information held that falls within the scope of the request would relate to, or have been supplied by, a body specified in section 23(3). 14. The Commissioner considered it clear that the subject matter of the request, involvement with the National Front, is within the area of work of bodies specified in section 23(3). She accepted that it was likely that, if the information described in the request did exist, this would have been complied with input from, or involvement with, the Security Service. She concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that any information held by the Police falling within the scope of the request would relate to, or have been supplied by, a body or bodies listed in section 23(3) and that therefore s 23(5) was engaged. 15. In the light of her findings on s 23(5) she did not go on to consider the other exemptions. Appeal 16. The Grounds of Appeal are in summary that: 16.1. The fact that the National Front was an organisation of interest to Special Branch is in the public domain; 16.2. The Commissioner failed to take proper account of the Upper Tribunal decision in Corderoy. The information should more properly be considered under s 30 and 4s 31 and therefore a qualified exemption should apply under which the public interest would favour a substantive confirmation or denial. The Commissioner’s response 17. The Commissioner consistently takes the view that, given the close working relationship between special branches and the security bodies, it is more likely than not that any information relating to the work of Special Branch would be caught by s 23. This approach must be applied consistently to prevent the indirect disclosure of information, thwarting Parliament’s intention in providing the NCND route. 18. In response to the specific grounds of appeal the Commissioner submits: 18.1. It is irrelevant if the activities of the Special Branch are in the public domain. There has been no official announcement and therefore confirming or denying whether information is held would disclose information that is not a matter of public record. 18.2. Corderoy does not apply because it was not a NCND case. It is not possible to disaggregate without confirming or denying its existence. Appellant’s response 19. The Appellant adds that as the work of the Undercover Policing Enquiry continues, more and more organisations are being publicly identified as having been the subject of Special Branch interest: 78 are on the official list. No real purpose is therefore served by a blanket NCND response. 20. It is wrong to suggest that the Commissioner has consistently adopted the view that it is more likely than not that any information relating to the work of Special Branch would be caught be s 23. 21. Special Branch monitoring of the National Front is effectively on the public record. 22. To the extent that any information within the scope of the request, were it to exist, would, under Corderory, need to be disaggregated and considered under another exemption, the NCND must also be considered under that other exemption. It cannot be right that a public authority can issue a NCND response purely under s 23 if any part of the material is covered by s 23 no matter how limited the connection of s 23 to the rest of the material. In this case s 30 and s 31 are likely to be engaged: a NCND request can still be given if the public interest test is satisfied under those exemptions. Response of the Police (the Second Respondent) 23. The Police have taken a consistent approach to neither confirming nor denying the actions and ambit of Special Branch and there is no formal confirmation or 5denial by any state actor of a Special Branch investigation or otherwise into the National Front or whether information is held relating to any such investigation. 24. Under s 23(5) the test to be applied is whether, on the balance of probabilities, the Tribunal is satisfied that the information was either directly or indirectly supplied by a s 23(3) body, or that the response would (one way or another) create a sufficient connection to a s 23(3) body as there is some connection or the information touches or stands in relation to a s 23 body. 25. The Police have taken a consistent approach to requests concerning Special Branch Investigations, given the known association between Special Branch and the security services. Corderoy does not apply to NCND cases. In any event, the Corderoy approach has no bearing on the facts of this case: if held the information would go to the core purpose of Special Branch: investigations into matters of national security and intelligence. On the facts of this case, the fact that the information may also fall within s 31 cannot preclude reliance on s 23. 26. If the Tribunal go on to consider the qualified exemptions (ss 24(2), 27(4), 30(3), 31(3), and 40(5B)), the Police submit that the public interest is in favour of not disclosing whether the information sought is held by the Police because: 26.1. It would be contrary to the public interest to reveal the nature and scope of any Special Branch investigations into extremist organisations where it would then be ascertainable by confirming or denying whether organisations were of interest to Special Branch (s 24(2)); 26.2. It is not in the public interest to damage international relations (s 27(4)); 26.3. It is not in the public interest to prejudice policy investigations or law enforcement by revealing whether or not information is held in respect of an extremist body (s 30(3) and 31(3)); 26.4. It is not in the public interest to reveal whether information is or is not held on persons who are known to be alive, so as to engage their rights, and thereby the Data Protection Principles under the Data Protection Act (s 40(5B)(a)(i)). Appellant’s response to the Police response 27. The Appellant makes the following additional points: 27.1. The Police have not taken a consistent approach to requests concerning Special Branch. In the past, they have made a number of substantial disclosures of Special Branch files. 27.2. The relationship between s 23 and s 24 is not relevant in this case. 27.3. Material covered by the request which falls outside s 23 can be disaggregated and therefore Corderoy is relevant. The majority of records in Special Branch files that the Appellant has read contain no reference to s 23 bodies. 27.4. The balance of the public interest lies against the use of NCND under any qualified exemption: if disclosing Special Branch interest in the National Front would cause any harm, this has already happened; it would reveal nothing about 6current police operations; the development of Special Branch monitoring of political movements is a significant historical matter and there is a public interest in greater historical knowledge, understanding and transparency. Appellant’s response to witness statement 28. The Appellant submits that Mr Southworth’s evidence that the Police do not adopt a blanket policy to FOI requests relating to Special Branch undermines their argument that they have a consistent approach. The fact that information entered the public domain by a particular route does not affect the fact that it is in the public domain. The fact that there is now significant liaison between the CTC and the Security Service does not mean that there was a similar exchange of information in the 1970s/1980s. The harm asserted by Mr Southworth is unsupported by evidence. Legal framework 29. Under s 1(1)(a) FOIA any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether or not it holds information of the description specified in the request. The duty of a public authority to comply with s 1(1)(a) is referred in the FOIA as ‘the duty to confirm or deny’. Neither confirming nor denying is referred to in this decision as “NCND”. 30. Section 2(1) provides that where any provision states that the duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to any information, the effect of the provision is that the duty does not apply where either: (a) the provision confers absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. 31. Section 23 is an absolute exemption. Sections 24(2), 27(4), 30(3), 31(3) and 40(5) are qualified exemptions. Section 23 32. Under s 23(1) information held by a public authority is exempt information if it was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority or relates to any of the bodies specified in s 23(3). 33. Under s 23(5) the duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would involve the disclosure of any information (whether or not already recorded) which was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the bodies specified in s 23(3). 734. Section 23(3) lists a number of bodies dealing with security matters, including the Security Service. Special Branch and the CTC are not in that list. 35. Both s 23(1) and (5) are class-based, which means that there is no requirement to demonstrate prejudice. 36. The expression ‘relates to’ is to be used in a wide sense (APPGER v IC and FCO [2015] UKUT 0377 (AAC)). It does not mean that the information has to have the security body as its focus, or main focus. 37. The Tribunal decides the question of whether or not information was supplied by or relates to a relevant body on the balance of probabilities. 38. The Appellant has relied on the case of Corderoy and therefore it is useful to set out the principles we draw from that case. Corderoy was a case under s 23(1) rather than s 23(5). It concerned requests for information relating to legal advice given to the Attorney General about a targeted drone attack in Syria in 2015. 39. The first issue raised by the Appellant is the ‘disaggregation’ of information. One of the issues which was before the Upper Tribunal in the Corderory appeal was: Does s 23(1) apply to the entirety of the contents of the Advice or can those contents be disaggregated, such that some of the information within it is not to be treated as covered by s 23(1)? 40. FOIA applies to information not documents. The focus of the request in Corderoy for ‘legal advice’ was, according to the Upper Tribunal, ‘the legal analysis underlying, and so the legal basis for, the Government’s conclusion and assertion that its policy on targeted drone strikes, and so the policy decision made by senior ministers that was referred to by the Prime Minister in his statement to the House of Commons on 7 September 2015, is lawful.’ The question therefore arose in Corderoy, as to whether the pure legal analysis which founded the view that the policy decision was lawful could be disaggregated from the rest of the legal advice and provided in an intelligible form. 41. In this appeal no question of disaggregation can arise. The ‘information’ in issue under s 23(5) is not the information covered by the the request, which we refer to as the ‘requested information’. It is whatever information would be disclosed by a confirmation or a denial that the requested information was held, which we refer to in this judgment as the ‘revealed information’. The revealed information does not need to be recorded information. It is, in essence, what the public would know as a result of a confirmation or a denial. The question for us is whether the revealed information falls within s 23(5). The fact that some or all of the requested information could be disaggregated and might not be covered by s 23(1) is not the issue. The contents of the requested information is not what we are concerned with under s 23(5). 842. We cannot rule out that there might, in an appropriate case, because of the terms of the request, be a situation where the revealed information was extensive and might be susceptible to disaggregation, but this is not one of those cases. 43. The other aspect of the Upper Tribunal decision is the proper scope of s 23(1) and in our view that is of direct relevance to this appeal, given the similarity in wording between s 23(1) and s 23(5). 44. The Upper Tribunal held that the legal analysis sought by the requests would have been and is of interest to the s 23 bodies. The existence of this interest can found a conclusion that, as a matter of language, that legal analysis ‘relates to’ s 23 bodies whether they sought the advice alone or together with others or were provided with the advice. 45. The Upper Tribunal held that in determining the scope that Parliament intended section 23(1) to have, it will be necessary to consider whether a qualified exemption would nevertheless apply to the requested information concerned. At paras 56 and 57 the Upper Tribunal held that the central question when considering the application of s 23(1) was: ‘which exemption or exemptions to the right to be provided with information conferred by FOIA did Parliament intend to apply to the disclosure of particular information by a public authority?’, which in the Corderoy appeal could be expressed as: ‘did Parliament intend that an absolute or qualified exemption would apply…?’. The Upper Tribunal’s view was that the correct approach to answering that central question was to address by reference to the content of the requested information which of the exemptions Parliament intended to apply. 46. The Upper Tribunal referred in paragraphs 59 and 60 to a ‘revelatory problem’, which did not arise in the Corderoy case: “59. We reiterate that Parliament clearly did not intend information to be obtained from or about security bodies through the back door and we acknowledge that there can be difficulty: (a) in an outsider identifying what the revelatory nature of information, if any, which is said to be subject to the absolute section 23 exemption might be, and so (b) in the application of an approach that asks whether the information is or might be revelatory of the Security Services’ activities, their intelligence or intelligence sources, and that these points support a wide approach to the reach of section 23. 60. But here, the revelatory problem does not exist. Firstly, no doubt because of the expected and confirmed involvement of the security bodies a “neither confirm nor deny approach” was correctly not advanced by the Respondents under section 23. Secondly, and on all of the scenarios set by the question set out in paragraph 38 above the Disaggregated Information: (a) is obviously of interest to all involved in formulating or acting in accordance with the Government policy on targeted drone strikes because it is an analysis of the lawfulness of that policy, but (b) that interest is limited to analysis of the relevant legal principles and does not reveal anything about the activities of security bodies as such which were involved, save that it sets the parameters of what is lawful and so the circumstances that must be established to exist to found that legal analysis.” 947. The Upper Tribunal concluded in para 62: “Returning to what we regard as the central question we have concluded that although we accept that the Disaggregated Information was and is of interest to security bodies for their statutory purposes and, as a matter of ordinary language can be said to relate to them, Parliament did not intend such information to be covered by the absolute section 23 exemption. The reasons for this are that (i) the interest of the security bodies in such information is shared by Parliament and the public because it relates and is confined to the legality of Government policy, and so (ii) such information falls obviously within the qualified exemptions in sections 35 and 42 as being legal advice on the formulation of Government policy.” 48. In our view, the Corderoy approach is applicable to a s 23(5) appeal in the following sense. In determining whether or not the revealed information ‘relates to’ a security body, we should consider which exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny Parliament intended to apply in relation to the disclosure of this revealed information. Which, in this appeal also, could be expressed as ‘did Parliament intend that an absolute or qualified exclusion would apply?’. 49. Like the Upper Tribunal, we reiterate that Parliament clearly did not intend that information about the Security Services should be revealed by the back door and we consider in our conclusions below the meaning and impact of para 59 and 60 of Corderoy. 50. We have also gained assistance from the Upper Tribunal in Savic v CO [2016] UKUT 535 which considered a number of NCND provisions. From that decision we draw the following general principles: 50.1. NCND is a protective concept because, as and when it applies, it stops inferences being drawn on the existence of types of information and enables an equivalent position to be taken on other occasions. 50.2. There is a need in each case to identify what information derives from a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer and to consider whether a ‘yes ‘or ‘no’ answer has the impact specified in the relevant provision. 50.3. The protection that NCND gives against the disclosure of the contents of the requested information is only a pragmatic consequence of its application and not a reason for it. It is therefore impermissible to introduce contents arguments at the NCND stage. 51. When deciding what information ‘derives from’ a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, we think that it is legitimate to consider both any information expressly communicated by the public authority and any inferences the public would draw from the information. 52. The Upper Tribunal asked a number of questions about the approach to deciding whether or not s 23(5) or s 23(1) applies, on which it intended to invite further submissions. We do not know whether submissions were submitted and no further decision has been promulgated on this issue. However, the Upper 10Tribunal gave the following indication at para 101: ‘we therefore see some force in the generic assertion of the appellant that the Commissioner and the CO have taken an impermissibly broad approach to the NCND response based on s 23(5) and s 24(2).’ 53. Looking at the Upper Tribunal’s questions in the light of this statement, we have reached the following conclusions to the correct approach. 54. We do not think that the Commissioner is correct in stating (at para 23 and para 29 of the Decision Notice) that s 23(5) is engaged if, on the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal (or the Commissioner), on the balance of probabilities, information within the scope of the request would relate to, or have been supplied by, a s 23(3) body. 55. This is because the statutory wording in s23(5) requires a focus on the revealed information, not the requested information. On the facts the likelihood of the requested information falling within the class is likely to be a relevant factor, but it does not necessarily mean that s 23(5) is engaged. It may, as the Upper Tribunal highlighted in Savic, point the other way: the known fact that it is more likely than not, by its nature, that the requested information will include information concerning the involvement of one or more s 23(3) bodies, may mean that compliance with s 1(1)(a) will not involve the disclosure of any of the information referred to in s 23 (see Savic para 98(i), (ii) and (iv)). 56. The question of whether or not s 23(5) is engaged needs to be answered in accordance with the wording of s 23(5): would a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer involve the disclosure of any information, whether or not already recorded, which was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the s 23(3) bodies. 57. In terms of the scope of the term ‘relates to’ we note that the Upper Tribunal questioned whether information that indicates that s 23(3) bodies were not involved ‘relate to’ those bodies. 58. We note also that the Upper Tribunal raised the question of how any information within the ambit of the request that does not merit an NCND response is to be identified and dealt with under FOIA. Section 24 (2) 59. Section 24(2) provides: The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, exemption from section 1(1)(a) is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 60. Section 24 is not an absolute exemption and therefore under s 2(1) where, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. 11Section 30(3) Investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities 61. Under s 30 (3) the duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to information which is, or if it were held by the public authority would be, exempt information by virtue of subsection (1) or (2). 62. Sections 30(1) and (2) provide that information is exempt information if it has been held by the authority for the purposes of certain investigations and proceedings. Under s 30(1) and (2): (1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information it if has at any time been held by the authority for the purpose of – (a) Any investigation which the public authority has a duty to conduct with a view to it being ascertained – (i) whether a person should be charged with an offence, or (ii) whether a person charged with an offence is guilty of it, (b) any investigation which is conducted by the authority and in the circumstances may lead to a decision by the authority to institute criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct, or (c) any criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct. (2) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if – (a) it was obtained or recorded by the authority for the purposes of its functions relating to- (i) investigations falling within subsection (1)(a) or (b), (ii) criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct […] (3) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1) or (2). 63. Sections 30(1) and (2) are class-based exemptions. There is no requirement for a public authority to demonstrate prejudice to be engaged. S 31(3) Law enforcement 64. Section 31(3) provides that the duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1). 65. Section 31 is not an absolute exemption and therefore under s 2(1) where, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. 66. The matters mentioned in subsection (1) are: (a) the prevention and detection of crime, (b) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, 12(c) the administration of justice, (d) the assessment or collection of any tax or duty or of any imposition of a similar nature, (e) The operation of the immigration controls, (f) The maintenance of security and good order in prisons or in other institutions where persons are lawfully detained, (g) The exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), (h) Any civil proceedings which are brought by or on behalf of a public authority and arise out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment, or (i) Any inquiry held under the Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc (Scotland) Act 2016 to the extent that the inquiry arises out of an investigation conducted, for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2), by or on behalf of the authority by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under an enactment. 67. The exemption and the exclusion are prejudice based. ‘Would or would be likely to’ means that the prejudice is more probable than not or that there is a real and significant risk of prejudice. Section 27(4) International relations 68. S 27(4) provides: The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) – (a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1), or (b) Would involve the disclosure of any information (whether or not already recorded) which is confidential information obtained from a State other then the United Kingdom or from an international organisation or an international court. 69. Section 27 is not an absolute exemption and therefore under s 2(1) where, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. 70. The matters mentioned in s 27(1) are: (a) Relations between the United Kingdom and any other State, (b) Relations between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or international court, (c) The interests of the United Kingdom abroad, or (d) The promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of its interests abroad. Section 40(5B) personal information 71. Section 40(5B) (as introduced by schedule 19, part 1, Data Protection Act 2018 provides that 13(5B) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that any of the following applies— (a) giving a member of the public the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a)— (i) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles, or (ii) would do so if the exemptions in section 24(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (manual unstructured data held by public authorities) were disregarded; (b) giving a member of the public the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene Article 21 of the GDPR (general processing: right to object to processing); (c) on a request under Article 15(1) of the GDPR (general processing: right of access by the data subject) for confirmation of whether personal data is being processed, the information would be withheld in reliance on a provision listed in subsection (4A)(a); (d) on a request under section 45(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (law enforcement processing: right of access by the data subject), the information would be withheld in reliance on subsection (4) of that section.… 72. Under s 2(1) the exclusion under s 40(5B) will only apply where, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. Issues Section 23(5) 73. Under s 23(5) the issue we have to determine is: would confirming or denying whether or not the Police held information held by what was then called Special Branch relating to the National Front in the relevant years involve the disclosure of information that relates to a s 23(3) body? 74. We do not accept that this question can be answered simply by concluding, on the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before the tribunal that any information relating to the work of Special Branch would relate to, or have been supplied by, a s 23(3) body. 75. In our view this issue can be broken down into the following questions: 75.1. What is the revealed information? This can be made up of: 75.1.1. Any information that is expressly communicated to the public by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, and 75.1.2. Any other information which would effectively be communicated to the public by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer because of the inferences the public would draw from the expressly communicated information. 75.2. Is this information already in the public domain? 75.3. If so, what is the relevance of that to s 23(5)? 1475.4. Does the revealed information ‘relate to’ a s 23(3) body as a matter of ordinary language? 75.5. If so, did Parliament not intend such information to be covered by the absolute section 23 exemption? 76. It will suffice if either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ answer would engage s 23(5). Section 24(2) 77. The issues under s 24(2) are: 77.1. Is s 24(2) engaged, i.e. is exemption from the duty to confirm or deny required for the purposes of safeguarding national security? 77.2. If so, in all the circumstances of the case, does the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweigh the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. Section 30(3) 78. The issues under s 30(3) are: 78.1. Is the request for information which is, or if it were held by the public authority would be, exempt information by virtue of subsection (1) or (2)? 78.2. If so, in all the circumstances of the case, does the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweigh the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. Section 31(3) 79. The issues under s 31(3) are: 79.1. Would a confirmation or denial that the information was held prejudice or be likely to prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection 31(1)? 79.2. If so, in all the circumstances of the case, does the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweigh the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. Section 27(4) 80. The issues under s 27(4) are: 80.1. Would a confirmation or denial that the requested information was held prejudice or be likely to prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and another State? 80.2. If so, in all the circumstances of the case, does the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. Section 40(5B) 81. The issues under s 40(5B) are: 1581.1. Would the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or would do so if the exemptions in section 24(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (manual unstructured data held by public authorities) were disregarded. Similarly, would giving a member of the public the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) (apart from this Act) contravene Article 21 of the GDPR (general processing: right to object to processing)? On a request under Article 15(1) of the GDPR (general processing: right of access by the data subject) for confirmation of whether personal data is being processed, the information would be withheld in reliance on a provision listed in subsection (4A)(a); alternatively, on a request under section 45(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (law enforcement processing: right of access by the data subject), the information would be withheld in reliance on subsection (4) of that section If so, in all the circumstances of the case, does the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweigh the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. The role of the tribunal 82. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Discussion and conclusions Consistency of response 83. In some circumstances it is important for a public authority to consistently give a NCND response to a particular category of request: if the Police adopt an approach whereby they only rely on the exclusion where, for example, they hold the information requested or where there has been Security Services involvement in a particular case, then it is easy to see that the cat is out of the bag in any event. The Police have asserted the need for consistency to support their NCND stance in this case. We find that in this case the need for consistency does not apply: The reason for not applying a NCND response under s23(5) is that the matter is more properly covered by another qualified exclusion – differentiating between other requests on this basis does not reveal anything. In relation to the qualified exclusions, differentiating is done on the basis that the information is already in the public domain, again differentiating on this basis does not reveal anything. Information in the public domain 1684. We have been provided with a transcript of the BBC programme ‘True Spies’. In it ex-Special Branch Officers provide details of Special Branch and MI5 surveillance of the National Front. It does not identify the specific years in which this took place, but refers to ‘the mid-70s’ and that it continued for ‘many years’. This is not based on a ‘leak’ from Special Branch. The press statement states that Special Branch assisted the BBC with their research on this programme. The Police or the Security Services have not issued any statements confirming or denying any information in the programme. 85. Having read the transcripts we find that, despite the lack of official confirmation or denial, any viewer, in the light of the statement that Special Branch had assisted the BBC with their research, would reasonably infer that Special Branch and MI5 had carried out surveillance of the National Front in 1974 and 1975 and probably in 1983. We find, therefore that is already known that Special Branch and MI5 were involved with the National Front throughout that period. Section 23(5) 86. Under s 23(5) the issue we have to determine is: would confirming or denying that the Police held information held by what was then called Special Branch relating to the National Front in the relevant years involve the disclosure of information that relates to a s 23(3) body? 87. We do not accept that this question can be answered simply by concluding, on the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before the tribunal that any information relating to the work or Special Branch would relate to, or have been supplied by, a s 23(3) body. 88. As stated, in our view this can be broken down into the following questions: 88.1. What is the revealed information? This can be made up of: 88.1.1. Any information that is expressly communicated to the public by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, and 88.1.2. Any other information which would effectively be communicated to the public by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer because of the inferences the public would draw from the expressly communicated information 88.2. Is this information already in the public domain? 88.3. If so, what is the relevance of that to s 23(5)? 88.4. Does the revealed information ‘relate to’ a s 23(3) body as a matter of ordinary language? 88.5. If so, did Parliament not intend such information to be covered by the absolute section 23 exemption? 89. It will suffice if either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ answer would engage s 23(5). 17What is the revealed information? 90. If the Police confirmed that they held information within the scope of the request, what would this reveal? Explicitly it would reveal that Special Branch held information relating to the National Front. The inference that the public would draw from that would be that Special Branch had been involved to some extent in investigating the National Front in those years. This does not, in itself, engage s 23(5). 91. Would the public also infer any involvement by the Security Services? We do not accept that this question can be answered simply by concluding, on the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before the tribunal that any information relating to the work or Special Branch would relate to, or have been supplied by, a s 23(3) body. 92. The police’s submissions and evidence and the Decision Notice focus on the question of whether or not the information held related to, or was supplied by, a s 23(3) body. They do not separately address the question of what inferences would be drawn by a member of the public from a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. 93. In our view, given the publicly known nature of the work of Special Branch and the nature of the National Front, a member of the public would probably infer from the fact that Special Branch held information relating to the National Front, that the Security Services were also probably involved to some extent in some capacity with some manner of Special Branch investigation into the National Front in those years. 94. A ‘no’ answer would reveal that Special Branch did not hold information relating to the National Front in those particular years. The inference that the public would draw from this about the Security Services less clear: it could be reasonably inferred that Special Branch had not been involved in investigating the National Front in those years, or it could be reasonably inferred that they no longer held any written information on any investigations. Despite the passage of time we think that it would be reasonable for the public to conclude that the absence of records probably indicates that Special Branch had not been actively involved in investigating the National Front in those particular years. None of these conclusions, in themselves, engage s 23(5). 95. What would the public infer from a ‘no’ response about any involvement by the Security Services? It would not be reasonable to infer that there had been no Security Services interest or engagement or investigation into the activities of the National Front in those years. As above, it could be reasonably inferred that the Security Services were probably not involved in a Special Branch investigation in to the National Front in those particular years. 18Is this information already in the public domain, and what is the consequence of that? 96. Any members of the public who saw the ‘True Spies’ programme will already have drawn the inference that the Security Services were involved to some extent in some capacity with some manner of investigation into the National Front. Although the involvement of MI5 has not been officially confirmed, neither will it be officially be confirmed by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer: it is purely an inference that the public is expected to draw from the information expressly communicated. 97. What is the relevance of this to s 23(5)? In the Commissioner’s response she submits, at para 17, that whether or not the activities of Special Branch are well established (or believed to be) is not a relevant consideration in the application of s 23(5). We disagree. Section 23(5) only applies to the ‘disclosure’ of information. It therefore cannot, in our view, apply to information that is already in the public domain. This is supported by the Upper Tribunal decisions in Savic and Corderoy. 98. The Upper Tribunal in Savic raised the question of whether or not the known fact that the requested information by its nature would include information concerning the involvement or otherwise of a s 23(3) body means that compliance with s1(1)(a) will not involve the disclosure of any of the information referred to in s 23(5). We understand the Upper Tribunal to have raised this question because if it is already known that the requested information will include information concerning the involvement or otherwise of a s 23(3) body, simply giving a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer will not disclose any further information. The extent of information already in the public domain was therefore seen as relevant. 99. Further, in Corderoy the Upper Tribunal noted that ‘because of the expected and confirmed involvement of the security bodies a ‘neither confirm nor deny approach’ was correctly not advanced’. Again, the extent of information in the public domain was seen as relevant. 100. In our view, therefore, it is arguable that because the public is likely to have already drawn the inference that the security bodies were involved with the National Front, no further information will be ‘disclosed’ by a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, because it would officially confirm the involvement of Special Branch, not the Security Services. However, we have concluded that because the request relates to specific years, we find that the inference which will be drawn is slightly more specific and therefore different to that already in the public domain and therefore there is some limited ‘disclosure’ in this case. Does the revealed information ‘relate to’ a s 23(3) body as a matter of ordinary language? 19101. Firstly in relation to the information revealed by a ‘yes’ answer, we find that as a matter of ordinary language the revealed information that indicates that the Security Services were probably involved to some extent in some capacity with some manner of Special Branch investigation into the National Front in those years does ‘relate to’ a s 23(3) body. 102. In relation to the information revealed by a ‘no’ answer, we find that information that indicates that the Security Services were probably not involved in a Special Branch investigation into the National Front in those years does as a matter of ordinary language ‘relate to’ a s 23(3) body. Although the Upper Tribunal raised the question in Savic of whether information that indicates that s 23(3) bodies were not involved ‘relates’ to those bodies, we are prepared to accept that as a matter of ordinary language it does. If so, did Parliament not intend such information to be covered by the absolute section 23 exemption? 103. We have reached the conclusion that Parliament did not intend such information to be covered by the absolute s 23 exemption for the following reasons. 103.1. The basis on which the information ‘relates to’ a s 23(3) body is because of the conclusions that can be drawn on the basis of the nature of the relationship between Special Branch and the Security Services. It therefore applies to all Special Branch activities. The Commissioner confirms in its response that it takes the position that s 23 is engaged in relation to any information relating to the work of Special Branch. 103.2. Parliament can be taken to have known about the nature of Special Branch activities and its close relationship with the Security Services. 103.3. It did not include Special Branch in the list of s 23(3) bodies. 103.4. It cannot therefore have intended that all its activities would fall within s 23. 103.5. ‘Relates to’ should therefore not be interpreted so widely that it would have this effect. 103.6. The revealed information falls obviously within the qualified exclusion in s 30(3) (investigation and proceedings conducted by public authorities). 104. We have considered whether what we have decided is consistent with para 59 of Corderoy in which the Upper Tribunal stated: “59….We reiterate that Parliament clearly did not intend information to be obtained from or about security bodies through the back door and we acknowledge that there can be difficulty: (a) in an outsider identifying what the revelatory nature of information, if any, which is said to be subject to the absolute section 23 exemption might be, and so (b) in the application of an approach that asks whether the information is or might be revelatory of the Security Services’ activities, their intelligence or intelligence sources, and that These points support a wide approach to the reach of section 23.” 20105. We find that it is consistent. In our view, were a request made to the Police for information held by Special Branch on MI5 involvement in a specific case, they would be entitled to refuse to confirm or deny whether they held that information. They could do this consistently in every request which asked whether or not they held information on MI5 involvement. This is because Parliament did not intend information to be obtained from or about Security bodies through the back door. This is different in our view from consistently refusing to confirm or deny any information which reveals anything about Special Branch activity on the basis that it works closely with the Security Services. If Parliament had intended all Special Branch activities to be covered by s 23 it would have included them in the list. 106. The above example also illustrates the point that the Commissioner is correct to observe that the Upper Tribunal in Corderoy did not purport to set down a general rule that the s 23 exemption could only be used if no other (qualified) exemptions were applicable. The existence of other applicable qualified exemptions is relevant to a consideration of Parliament’s intentions but it is not the only relevant factor and is not determinative of the issue. 107. For the above reasons we conclude that s 23(5) is not engaged in this case. Section 24(2) Is section 24(2) engaged? 108. Is exemption from the duty to confirm or deny required for the purposes of safeguarding national security? 109. The Second Respondent submits that it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal the nature and scope of any Special Branch investigations into extremist organisations where it would then be ascertainable by confirming or denying whether organisations were of interest to Special Branch (s 24(2)). It is unclear to us how confirming or denying whether organisations were of interest to Special Branch would reveal the ‘nature and scope’ of any Special Branch investigations into extremist organisations. What would be revealed is set out in paragraphs 90-95 above. Further, the fact that the National Front were of interest to Special Branch during that broad period of time is already in the public domain. 110. The Police rely on their responses of 15 October 2018 and 25 May 2018. In the letter of 15 October 2018 the Police states that confirming or denying whether information in respect of any individual or organisation is held by Special Branch would clearly indicate the nature and scale of police involvement in areas of preventing and detecting crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders and the administration of justice. We are unclear as to how a 21confirmation or denial could indicate the ‘nature and scale’ of police involvement. 111. The letter states that disclosure of whether or not information was held in relation to the National Front would impair the effectiveness of the partnership relationship between Special Branch and s 23(3) bodies. It would undermine the ability of Special Branch and the Security Service to share and exchange information and intelligence in the knowledge that such intelligence will be managed by all parties in an appropriately confidential manner. There is nothing in an indication by Special Branch that it holds or does not hold information about the National Front which suggests that they will not manage intelligence in an appropriately confidential manner. 112. The Police argue that they have to take a consistent approach. 113. It is not suggested that Special Branch should determine whether or not to apply s 24(2) on the basis of whether or not the Security Services are involved in the matter to which the request relates, or on the basis of whether or not information is held. The Tribunal accepts that differentiation on this basis would reveal security service involvement or whether or not information is held. However, Special Branch should take account of whether or not the requested information is already in the public domain when deciding whether or not exemption from the duty to confirm or deny is required for the purposes of national security. Differentiating on this basis would not lead to the consequences set out in the letter such as identifying the involvement of the security services. 114. Differentiating on the basis that this information is already in the public domain does not allow those who are intent on causing harm to learn more about the nature and extent of Special Branch and Security Service interest, because the fact that Special Branch and MI5 were interested in the National Front is already in the public domain. A confirmation or denial in this case would not therefore facilitate those intent on causing harm taking action to avoid the attention of authorities. 115. We cannot see how official confirmation of a known fact (that the National Front were of interest to Special Branch and the Security Service) could impair prevention and detection of crime, render security measures less effective, compromise the security of policing information, compromise confidential sources, or place individuals at risk (victims, informants and witnesses) or deter individuals and partner organisations from contacting the police. The letter does not explain how these consequences might follow. 116. We note that there is no suggestion that any of these consequences have already resulted from the broadcasting of the ‘True Spies’ programme. There is no suggestion that Special Branch, having assisted the BBC with their 22research, attempted to prevent the ex-officers from making the statements they did, or from preventing the programme from being broadcast. This is surprising given the adverse consequences put forward by the Police. It is not clear to us what, if any, additional consequences the Police asserts would flow from the limited extra information revealed by a confirmation or denial set out in paragraph 100 above. 117. We accept that the Police are in a better position than the Tribunal to assess the potential consequences of the public becoming aware of Special Branch interest in the National Front, but we find that any adverse consequences flow from the broadcasting of the ‘True Spies’ programme, not from any later confirmation or denial. In this case the cat is already out of the bag. 118. On this basis we conclude that s24(2) is not engaged because we do not accept that exemption from the duty to confirm or deny is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security. 119. We do not therefore need to consider the public interest balance, but we do so in case we are wrong to conclude that s 24(2) is not engaged. The question for us to determine is whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. 120. We find that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion does not outweigh the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information. We do not think that the fact of Special Branch interest in the National Front being in the public domain reduces the public interest in disclosing whether or not the public authority holds the information. The public authority’s confirmation or denial is a gateway to either disclosure of that information, confirmation that the information is not held or the application of a substantive exemption. The public interest in obtaining a confirmation or denial is therefore not diminished by Special Branch interest in the National Front already being in the public domain. 121. In contrast, we find that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty is significantly diminished by the fact that the public is already aware of Special Branch and MI5 interest in the National Front. 122. In conclusion, if we had had to decide the public interest balance under s 24(2) we would have concluded that it favoured confirming or denying that the information was held. Section 30(3) 23123. We find that the request is for information which is, or if it were held by the public authority would be, by its nature exempt information by virtue of subsection 30(1) or (2). The question for us is therefore whether or not the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in confirming or denying that the information is held. 124. We conclude that it does not. We rely on the reasons set out under s 24(2) above, both in relation to whether or not the s24(2) exemption is engaged and on the public interest balance. In addition, we have already considered and rejected the arguments about the dangers of departing from a consistent NCND response. Our primary reason for concluding that the public interest favours confirming or denying that the information is already held, is that any harm that flows from the confirmation or denial would already have occurred as a result of the fact that Police holds information being in the public domain. We also note that the request relates to the years 1974, 1975 and 1983 and we find that confirming or denying that such information is held is unlikely to prejudice any current investigation into the National Front. Section 31(3) 125. For the reasons already set out under 24(2) and 30(3) above, we find that confirming or denying whether the requested information was held would not prejudice or be likely to prejudice any of the matters mentioned in subsection 31(1). S 31(3) is therefore not engaged, but if it had been we would have concluded that the public interest favoured confirming or denying for the reasons set out above. Section 27 126. We do not accept that a confirmation or denial that the information requested was held would prejudice or be likely to prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and another State. The Police assert that the impact of confirming or denying whether the information was held would mean that the Police and the United Kingdom would lose the confidence of their international partners and consequently this would impact negatively on the global fight against extremist groups.The Police state that they and security bodies both within the UK and internationally need to be able to work together in complete trust. If this is not maintained, the UK’s ability to protect and promote UK interests through international relations will be disadvantaged. 127. We do not accept that this prejudice will result from the confirmation or denial of whether the requested information is held. We reiterate our reasoning under s 24 above: We cannot see how official confirmation of a known fact (that the National Front were of interest to Special Branch and the Security Service) could cause a loss of confidence in international partners or destroy the trust 24in the way asserted by the Police. We repeat our observation above that there is no suggestion that any of these consequences have already resulted from the broadcasting of the ‘True Spies’ programme. There is no suggestion that Special Branch, having assisted the BBC with their research, attempted to prevent the ex-officers from making the statements they did, or from preventing the programme from being broadcast. This is surprising given the adverse consequences for international relations put forward by the Police. 128. Again, we accept that the Police are in a better position than the Tribunal to assess the potential consequences of the public becoming aware of Special Branch interest in the National Front, but we find that any adverse consequences flow from the broadcasting of the ‘True Spies’ programme, not from any later confirmation or denial. 129. The Police also assert that confirming or denying details of any possible engagements with other countries could potentially damage bilateral relationships between the UK and other states. The Police do not explain how confirming or denying that the requested information is held would confirm or deny details of any possible engagement with other countries and we do not accept that it would. We do not accept that confirming or denying that this information was held would potentially highlight engagements that had taken place between the UK and another state. 130. For those reasons we do not need to go on to consider the public interest balance, but we would have concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny was outweighed by the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information for the reasons set out above. Section 40(5B) 131. We do not accept that confirming or denying that information is held in relation to a group would contravene any of the data protection principles, even if it is likely that the requested information will contain some individuals’ private data. A confirmation or denial in relation to information held about a group does not tell the public that information is held in relation to any living individual. We do not therefore need to go on to consider the public interest balance under this section. Next steps 132. The tribunal considered whether or not to issue a substitute decision notice. Such a notice would have required the public authority to issue a fresh response confirming or denying whether it held information within the scope of the response and, if it does hold such information, at the same time communicating the information to the complainant or, if the Public Authority 25is to any extent relying on a claim that information is exempt information, giving the complainant a notice under s 17 FOIA specifying the exemption in question and, stating, if that would not otherwise be apparent, why the exemption applies and, if applicable, the reasons for claiming that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 133. The tribunal has decided that in the light of the Upper Tribunal judgments in Information Commissioner v E Malnick and The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments [2018] UKUT 72 (AAC) and NHS England V Information Commissioner and Dean [2019] UKUT 145 (AAC) that the consideration of potential further exemptions should be dealt with by this Tribunal through further submissions and deliberations rather than, in effect, by remitting the matter to the public authority and, as a necessary consequence, the Information Commissioner. 134. The tribunal was unsure as to whether or not Malnick was intended to apply in a ‘gateway’ appeal such as this one, i.e. when the public authority has either given a NCND response or has relied on, for example, s 12 or s 14, because the public authority has not yet complied with the duty in s 1(1)(a) FOIA. 135. However we concluded that the general tenor of Malnick and subsequent Upper Tribunal decisions is that the first tier tribunal, once seized, should determine the issue. Pragmatically, the matter is likely to be resolved more quickly if we determine the issue on the basis of further submissions rather then sending it back to the public authority. We have therefore issued appropriate case management directions. Signed Sophie Buckley Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 18 July 2019 26"
"341","FOI","IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 BETWEEN:- IAN BENSON Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL Second Respondent ______________________________________________________ DECISION AND REASONS ______________________________________________________ Determined on the papers by: Alison McKenna, Tribunal Judge Gareth Jones, Tribunal Member David Sivers, Tribunal Member On 4 November 2011 at Salisbury Law Courts Decision dated: 10 November 2011 Subject Matter: Section 21 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 DECISION This appeal is hereby dismissed. REASONS Background 1. This appeal concerns the First Respondent’s Decision Notice FS50310776 dated 20 April 2011. 2. The Appellant made an information request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) to the Second Respondent for the workplace e mail addresses of all the University’s staff. The Second Respondent confirmed that it held the requested information but asserted that the information fell under s. 21(1) FOIA because it was reasonably accessible otherwise than under FOIA. 3. The First Respondent concluded in his Decision Notice that the Second Respondent had correctly applied s. 21(1), with the exception of two e mail addresses which fell outside the scope of the request and one which had been omitted in error and was supplied to the Appellant. The Tribunal is not concerned with those matters. The Tribunal is also not concerned with the dispute between the Appellant and the Second Respondent concerning events which occurred subsequent to the information request. The First Respondent’s Decision Notice noted that the Second Respondent had adopted a publication scheme pursuant to s. 19 FOIA. He stated at paragraph 36 that: “The Commissioner…is satisfied that the contact directory was available via the scheme at the date of the request and remains so now”. He concluded that s. 21(3) of FOIA operated so that information made available under the terms of a publication scheme was to be regarded as reasonably accessible to the applicant. 2Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 4. The parties agreed that this appeal should be determined on the papers and the Tribunal concluded that this was an appropriate mode of hearing in this case. There was no closed material before the Tribunal. The Tribunal considered an agreed hearing bundle consisting of over 150 pages of evidence and argument. The Tribunal was referred to a decision of the Information Tribunal (as it then was) in Ames v Information Commissioner and Cabinet Office EA/2007/0110. The Tribunal notes that this is a first instance decision which turns on its own facts and has no precedential value. The Role of the Tribunal 5. This appeal is brought under s.57 FOIA. 6. The powers of the Tribunal in determining an appeal under s.57 FOIA are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” The Issues for the Tribunal 7. The issues for the Tribunal in this appeal are (i) whether the First Respondent erred in law in concluding that the information requested by the Appellant was reasonably accessible by means other than FOIA so that it had no duty to disclose it; (ii) if the s. 21 exemption is not available, whether the information requested is exempt under s. 40(2) FOIA (data protection). 3Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 The Appellant has suggested that the Second Respondent is covertly running an argument that the information is exempt under s. 36 FOIA (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs). The Second Respondent has denied this and the Tribunal has not therefore considered this exemption. The Parties’ Submissions 8. The Appellant’s sole ground of appeal in his Notice of Appeal dated 8 May 2011 was that the First Respondent had misinterpreted s. 21 of FOIA. He argued that the First Respondent had taken insufficient account of the degree of difficulty in collating the information requested from across the University’s website. He estimated that it would take him over 20 hours to compile a comprehensive list of staff e mail addresses. He cited a decision of the Scottish Information Commissioner in support of his arguments and argued that the First Respondent had taken insufficient account of the fact that he suffers from keyboard strain. He also presented argument concerning events subsequent to the Decision Notice in respect of which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. 9. The First Respondent filed a Response dated 13 June 2011 in which he argued that, as the University had adopted a publication scheme and the information requested was available in accordance with it, then the effect of s. 21(3) was that the information must be regarded as reasonably accessible, there being no discretion in the matter. The First Respondent accepted that there could be occasions when the applicant’s difficulties in accessing the information could mean that it is not reasonably accessible notwithstanding s.21(3), however the Appellant was not in this case arguing that he could not access the information, merely that it would be time consuming to do so. He argued that both he and the Second Respondent had taken information about the Appellant’s condition into account. The First Respondent also submitted that the decision of the Scottish Information Commissioner referred to by the Appellant was not binding on the Tribunal, did not concern the same legislation and did not involve information available under a publication scheme in any event. It therefore added nothing to the Appellant’s arguments. 4Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 10. The Second Respondent was joined to the appeal and filed a Response in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions. It supported the First Respondent’s arguments. It raised an additional exemption under s. 40(2) FOIA (data protection) but invited the Tribunal to consider this exemption only if it were not satisfied on the s. 21 arguments. 11. In replying to the Responses, the Appellant repeated his argument that s. 21(3) does not in his view operate to dis-apply s. 21(1) where there is a publication scheme. He argued that the important criteria for the Tribunal to address in considering whether the information was reasonably accessible were (i) a comparison of the time and difficulty for the applicant in accessing the information requested, compared with the time and difficulty for the public authority in complying with the request and (ii) what a typical member of the public would have to do to access the information. He raised an alternative argument that as he had requested a “list” of e mail addresses, and the publication scheme covers individual e mail addresses on different web pages, the information he had requested was not covered by the publication scheme in any event. 12. The Appellant and the Second Respondent submitted written submissions in advance of the hearing which helpfully summarised their cases and did not raise any new material issues. The First Respondent did not provide additional submissions but referred the Tribunal to its Decision Notice and Response in support of its case. The Tribunal’s Conclusions 13. The Tribunal accepts the submissions of the First and Second Respondents that information which is available under the terms of a publication scheme is to be regarded as reasonable accessible. This is essentially a question of the interpretation of the statutory provisions of s. 21(1) and s. 21(3) of FOIA. The Tribunal has not been referred to any binding authority in this regard, but notes that the leading text book on Information Rights edited by Philip Coppel takes this approach. 5Appeal No. EA/2011/0120 14. The Tribunal rejects the Appellant’s alternative argument that a “list” of the e mail addresses does not fall within the publication scheme, which covers individual e mail addresses only. This argument would run counter to Parliament’s intention in providing public authorities with a clear incentive to adopt a publication scheme by allowing applicants to avoid s. 21(3) with differently worded requests for the same information. 15. In view of the Appellant’s arguments that s. 21(3) should not be relied upon by the Tribunal in considering whether s. 21(1) was satisfied, the Tribunal has considered what view it would take if s. 21(3) did not apply. It has concluded that even without the publication scheme, the information was “reasonably accessible to the applicant” within the terms of s. 21(1) of FOIA. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal notes that the information requested was not said by the Appellant to be difficult for him to find on the website, merely that it was spread across a number of web pages so that he found it inconvenient to harvest and re-use the information. The Tribunal finds that this is not a relevant consideration in relation to the question of whether the information requested was “reasonably accessible” to the Appellant in this case. The Tribunal further notes that the Appellant’s arguments in relation to the special circumstances of his keyboard strain appear to relate to the process of collation and re-use of the information rather than to his ability to access it. 16. In view of the Tribunal’s findings in relation to the s. 21 (1) exemption, it has not considered whether the exemption under s. 40 (2) of FOIA was engaged in this case. For the reasons above, the Tribunal dismisses this appeal and upholds the Decision Notice. Signed: Dated: 10 November 2011 Alison McKenna Tribunal Judge 6"
"93","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0238 Decided without a hearing On 4 April 2019 Before HH JUDGE SHANKS SUZANNE COSGRAVE STEPHEN SHAW Between OWEN JEBB Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER RespondentDECISION OF FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL For the reasons set out below the appeal is allowed and the following substitute decision notice is issued. Substitute Decision Notice Complainant: Owen Jebb Public Authority: Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council Decision The Public Authority did not deal with the Complainant’s request for information made on 22 January 2018 in accordance with Part I of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) in that it wrongly refused to communicate to him the quantum of an outstanding extension of time request submitted by the contractor in relation to the A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road project. Steps to be taken The Public Authority must by 1600 on 10 May 2019 provide the Complainant with that information. HH Judge Shanks 11 April 2019. REASONS Background 1. This appeal concerns the project for the construction of the A6 Manchester Airport Relief Road (A6MARR). Construction started in spring 2015 and was due to be completed by spring 2018. The contractor was a joint venture between Carillion and Morgan Sindall and the relevant local authority was Stockport MBC. 2. The Appellant, Mr Jebb, lives in Bramhall in Stockport. The construction works, particularly lane closures at the A34 Stanley Green roundabout, caused him, and no doubt many other residents, a great deal of inconvenience. 3. By early 2018 at the latest Mr Jebb was concerned that the spring 2018 completion date was not going to be met, although the Council were still officially maintaining that the works would be completed on schedule. On 22 January 2018, he made a FOIA request to the Council seeking:- The original Contract completion date for this project - The revised completion date, if this has been amended under the provisions of the Contract; - The quantum of any Extension of Time request(s) submitted by the Contractor, which may be currently under review by the Engineer. 4. The Council responded by email on 19 February 2018 stating that the original completion date was 30 March 2018, that there had been no revision to this date, and that information as to extension of time requests was commercially sensitive and that they were entitled to withhold it under section 43(2) of FOIA. Mr Jebb sought an internal review of the Council’s response so far as it related to the quantum of any extension of time request. On 27 March 2018 the Council’s Information Governance Manager wrote to him maintaining the Council’s position and stating: Upon meeting with the Service Area, it was clear to me that no defined Extension of Time request has yet been submitted by the contractor. The Council and the contractor are still in negotiations as to the completion date of the scheme and that the Section 43(2) exemption has been applied to the details of those negotiations. Once a revised completion date is known the Council would be happy to share this. (sic) 5. Mr Jebb complained to the Information Commissioner who issued a decision notice on 30 October 2018. The decision notice records that the Council had confirmed that they did hold information within the scope of the request but upheld their position in relation to section 43(2) of FOIA. Mr Jebb has appealed to this Tribunal against the Commissioner’s decision notice. 6. The A6MARR finally opened on 15 October 2018 and the A34 Stanley Green roundabout lane closures were lifted on 15 November 2018. The appeal 7. In addition to the papers in the open bundle, the Tribunal was provided with one relevant contractual document from December 2017 on a “closed basis”. This document shows unequivocally that, contrary to what is stated in the Council’s letter of 27 March 2018, there was a “defined extension of time request” in existence from December 2017 at the latest. We cannot say who at the Council was responsible for the misleading statement in that letter but it is a matter of some concern to the Tribunal that a public authority should have made such a statement in the context of dealing with a FOIA request. 8. On the appeal the Commissioner accepts that the document does indeed contain information answering Mr Jebb’s request but she maintains that the Council were entitled to rely on section 43(2). The issues on the appeal are therefore whether, in the light of all relevant material now before us and looking at the position as at February/March 2018:(a) disclosure of “the quantum of the extension of time request” then in existence under FOIA would, or would have been likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of the Council and/or the contractor; and, if so (b) the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosing that information. Prejudice 9. On the material we have seen, we are satisfied that there were sensitive and confidential negotiations going on between the contractor and the Council in early 2018 in which the contractor was seeking additional time and money. Further, it seems to us that the request for an extension of time was directly relevant to the position being taken by the contractor in those negotiations. It is not entirely clear to us, however, how disclosure of the quantum of the requested extension of time would have prejudiced, or would have been likely to prejudice, the commercial interests of the Council or the contractor. 10. As we understand the Council’s position (as set out in Mr Farooq’s email dated 2 October 2018 at pp 69/70 of our bundle), the concern was that disclosure of the requested information would have breached the confidentiality of the negotiations, which could have led to their failure, which in turn could have resulted in legal proceedings and further delay to the project, all of which would have involved further cost and thus damage to the Council’s commercial interests. 11. In our view that is not a very likely scenario. Any disclosure would have been limited to the quantum of the request for an extension of time which had been made by the contractor some months before the disclosure; it would not have included any financial details nor any of the underlying material to support the request. It would have been made by a public authority pursuant to a FOIA request. Although we cannot exclude a risk that the negotiations would have broken down in consequence of such disclosure, we would not regard it as a very significant risk. We do accept, however, that if negotiations had indeed broken down there could have been substantial commercial implications. 12. We therefore accept that section 43(2) of FOIA was engaged but, given our views as to the likelihood of the proposed scenario materializing, we do not consider that the public interest in maintaining the exemption was very weighty. Public interest balance 13. It is therefore necessary for us to consider the public interest balance and to compare the weight of the public interest in disclosure of the requestedinformation as at February/March 2018 with the weight of the public interest in maintaining the section 43(2) exemption as we have found it to be. 14. The state of the project in early 2018 was undoubtedly a matter of substantial legitimate public interest: the overall cost of the project was (according to the Manchester Evening News report from 6 February 2018 at our pp 40-42) some £290 million; it had been discussed for many years; the works were causing substantial inconvenience to local residents; it was clearly subject to delays as at February/March 2018; and it was public knowledge that Carillion, one of the joint venture partners, had recently collapsed. 15. Furthermore, Mr Jebb’s position is that at the time of his request the Council was “still stating adamantly that the … project would be completed by spring” but that they must have known that this could not be achieved and that the reason for his request was that he was seeking to obtain more reliable information than that which the Council was putting out. That position has not really been challenged on the appeal and is broadly confirmed by the Manchester Evening News report we refer to and by the Council’s approach in the letter of 27 March 2018. The fact that it appears that the Council was not providing accurate information to the public at the time of the request is in our view an important factor in increasing the weight of the public interest in disclosure. 16. Taking all those circumstances into account we consider that the weight of the public interest in disclosure in this case was substantially greater than the weight of the public interest in maintaining the section 43(2) exemption. It was not therefore open to the Council to rely on section 43(2) to withhold disclosure. Outcome 17. In our view the Council ought to have provided Mr Jebb with the information he was seeking and we disagree with the Commissioner’s decision to the contrary. We therefore allow his appeal and issue the substituted decision notice set out above. Our decision is unanimous.

"145","FOI","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2016/0116 Heard at Belfast RCJ On 29 September 2016 Before JUDGE CHRIS RYAN TRIBUNAL MEMBERS SUZANNE COSGRAVE MARION SAUNDERS Between THOMAS BENNETT Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and REGULATION AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONS Attendances: The Appellant appeared in person. No other party appeared although observers attended on behalf of each Respondent.IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2016/0116 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is allowed in part and the Decision Notice dated 29 March 2016 is substituted by the following notice: Public Authority: Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority Complainant: Thomas Bennett The Decision Notice dated 29 March 2016 remains in force with respect to the information to which section 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) has been applied. In relation to the information to which FOIA section 36 was applied the Decision Notice is replaced by a direction that the Public Authority disclose the requested information within 35 days. In relation to the information to which FOIA section 40(2) was applied, the Public Authority must (i) disclose those parts of the withheld information identified in the Reasons for Decision below by the date and on the terms set out therein, and (ii) by the same date report on the outcome of the further search we have directed and either disclose the additional information, or notify the Appellant of any exemption it intends to rely on. In relation to the information to which section 42 was applied the Public Authority must disclose, within 35 days, the information identified in the Reasons for Decision as being not covered by the section.REASONS FOR DECISION Summary 1. We have decided that, although the Decision Notice from which this appeal emanates correctly identified part of the Appellant’s information request as vexatious, for the purposes of section 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), it was not in accordance with the law in the following respects: a. FOIA section 36 was not engaged in respect of the information for which it was claimed as an exemption; b. Even if section 36 was engaged the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure; c. FOIA section 42 was not engaged in respect of two out of the four documents for which it was claimed as an exemption; d. The public interest in maintaining the section 42 exemption in respect of the remaining two documents outweighed the public interest in disclosure; and e. FOIA section 40(2) was not engaged in respect of some of the information for which it was claimed as an exemption. Background Information 2. The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (“RQIA”) is the Northern Ireland Regulator of Health and Social Care. 3. The Appellant has been concerned for some time over the management and operation of the Cherry Tree House care home in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland (“the Care Home”). In 2014, following an independent review, the RQIA published a report about it entitled “Independent Review of the Actions Taken in Relation to Concerns Raised about the Care Delivered at Cherry Tree House, Carrickfergus” (“the Report”). 4. The Report was not included among our papers but we were referred to its location on the RQIA website. The investigation which lay behind the report had been instigated in response to concerns expressed by a particular “whistle-blower”. It covered the operations at the Care Home between 1 January 2005 and 31 March 2013. The Chief Medical Officer, in commissioning the investigation, noted that concerns in respect of the Care Home had arisen since 2005 and that regulatory enforcement action had been instigated, but that it was not clear whether all concerns and allegations had been investigated and all appropriate actions taken. 5. The Report focused, not on the detail of the care provided at the Care Home, but on the supervision of that care and the steps taken to deal with any shortcomings. It criticised RQIA’s inspection methodology and practices, including the limited use that it had made of the enforcement powers available to it and concluded that: “[the Care Home] was failing to comply consistently with the minimum care standards. There was evidence that the same issues of concern about care…were highlighted on a regular basis and where improvements were made they were often not sustained.”6. The Appellant was not satisfied about the rigour of the investigation on which the Report was based and made his views known to RQIA’s management in correspondence and during at least one meeting. 7. On 21 November 2014 the RQIA wrote to the Appellant to inform him that, as he had by then written to it on 33 occasions concerning the Report, it did not intend to engage in further rounds of correspondence with him. It argued that the Appellant’s correspondence was repetitive and had consumed a disproportionate amount of its time and resources. The Request for Information and RQIA’s response 8. Some 8 months later, on 21 July 2015, the Appellant wrote again to the RQIA complaining that, over a year after the Report had been published, his concerns had still not been addressed to his satisfaction. He expressed particular concern that: a. the Care Home continued under the ownership of a particular individual (“the Owner”); b. the Report had been based on a “desktop review”, rather than an investigation; and c. there remained unanswered questions over the way in which the Independent Review Team had conducted itself. 9. In light of those criticisms the Appellant requested a meeting and asked that, in preparation for it, he be provided with certain information. The requested information fell into the following three parts: i. First Part. “All records surrounding RQIA’s consideration and possible cancellation of the registration of [the Owner] and the decision not to cancel [the Owner’s] registration, to include legal advice received by RQIA in respect of this. In anticipation that RQIA will claim legal privilege exemption I would make the following points: (a) any such legal advice was obtained at the public expense and for the sole benefit of the public, so really the public is ultimately the client and the privilege therefore belongs to the public. (b) It is in the public interest that such advice be made public.” ii. Second Part. All records surrounding the appointment of [a former manager of the Care Home] (“the Manager”) as an RQIA inspector, to include the short-listing process, the interview process, how many were short- listed, the make-up of the interview panel, why [the Manager] was chosen over other applicants, was [the Manager’s] behaviour while manager at [the Care Home] available to the interview panel. There is considerable concern among [the Care Home] families that [the Manager] was appointed as an RQIA inspector given her behaviour while manager at [the Care Home] and the question has been raised if the application/appointment process was and is sufficiently robust. This is a matter which requires examination.” iii. Third Part. “We had previously asked RQIA for information about [the Report] and that information has not been forthcoming. Should RQIA continue to refuse to release this information to us we will seek to make such application or applications as may be necessary to obtain same. We will also put into the public domain the fact that RQIA has refused to release that information to us.The information we had previously sought, and which RQIA has failed to supply, included the following: (a) all records maintained by [individual name redacted], project manager. (b) all records of all meetings between the Independent Review Team (including its staff) in and around April and May 2014 with officials from DHSSPS [the Department of Health Services and Public Safety] and various Trusts when the Independent Report was shared with these organisations and copies were given to them. What was the legal authority which enabled the Independent Review Team to share/disclose the Independent Report with/to these organisations prior to publication and prior to the Report being furnished to the Minister for Health. Such action may well have been unlawful. (c)the water-marked copies of [the Report] referred to in the minute of the meeting dated 24-3-14 between Glenn Houston and the Independent Review Team. (d) the ‘list…with the other organisations feedback” referred to in [individual name redacted]’s email to [the project manager referred to in (a) above] dated 30-4-14”. 10. The RQIA treated the Appellant’s letter as a request for information under FOIA section 1. That provision imposes on the public authorities to which it applies an obligation to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply, or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. Each of those exemptions is categorised as either an absolute exemption or a qualified exemption. If an absolute exemption is found to be engaged, then the information covered by it may not be disclosed. However, if a qualified exemption is found to be engaged then disclosure may still be required unless, pursuant to FOIA section 2(2)(b): “in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 11. The RQIA refused disclosure, relying on the following exemptions: a. As to the First Part, the information was exempt from disclosure because it fell within the scope of FOIA section 36 (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs). To the extent that the information requested was legal advice it was also said to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA section 42 (legal professional privilege). The RQIA asserted that the public interest in maintaining each of those exemptions outweighed the public interest in disclosure. b. The information requested in the Second Part, relating to the appointment of the Manager as an RQIA inspector, was claimed to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA section 40 (third party personal data). c. The Third Part was refused because it was said to fall within the scope of FOIA section 14 (vexatious request), for the reasons which had been given in correspondence in the letter of 21 November 2014, referred to in paragraph 7above. 12. The RQIA maintained its stance on each part of the information request following an internal review, conducted at the Appellant’s request. However, the RQIA did not mention FOIA section 36 in reporting to the Appellant the outcome of the internal review. It appears not to have given any consideration to it at that stage.The statutory language of the exemptions relied on 13. The relevant part of FOIA section 36 is subsection (2), which reads: “(2) Information to which this section applies is exempt information if, in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person, disclosure of the information under this Act— (a)… (b) would, or would be likely to, inhibit— (i) the free and frank provision of advice, or (ii) the free and frank exchange of views for the purposes of deliberation, or (c) would otherwise prejudice, or would be likely otherwise to prejudice, the effective conduct of public affairs.” 14. The relevant part of FOIA section 42 reads: “(1) Information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege or, in Scotland, to confidentiality of communications could be maintained in legal proceedings is exempt information.” 15. Sections 36 and 42 both create qualified exemptions. 16. FOIA section 40(2) provides that information is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of a third party the disclosure of which would contravene any of the data protection principles. It is an absolute exemption. 17. Personal data is itself defined in section 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) which provides: “’personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller” 18. The data protection principles are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the DPA. The only one having application to the facts of this Appeal is the first data protection principle. It reads: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully, and in particular shall not be processed unless- (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met …” Schedule 2 then sets out a number of conditions, but only one is relevant to the facts of this case. It is found in paragraph 6(1) and reads:“The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” The term “processing” has a wide meaning (DPA section 1(1)) and includes disclosure. 19. A broad concept of protecting individuals from unfair or unjustified disclosure (in the event that their personal data has been publicly requested) is a thread that runs through the data protection principles, including the determination of what is “necessary” for the purpose of identifying a legitimate interest. In order to qualify as being “necessary” there must be a pressing social need for it - Corporate Officer of the House of Commons v Information Commissioner and others [2008] EWHC 1084 (Admin). 20. In determining whether or not disclosure of the names would be contrary to the data protection principles we have adopted the following approach: i. would disclosure at the time of the information request have been necessary for a relevant legitimate purpose; without resulting in ii. an unwarranted interference with the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the Manager or any other individuals likely to be affected. And if our conclusion on those points would lead to a direction that the information should be disclosed we would consider: iii. whether disclosure would nevertheless have been unfair or unlawful for any other reason. 21. In respect to the issue of fair and lawful processing we have to bear in mind guidance provided in paragraph 1(1) of Part II of Schedule 1 to the DPA, which provides: “In determining for the purposes of the [first data protection principle] whether personal date are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed.” 22. The relevant part of FOIA section 14 reads: “(1)Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious.” The Information Commissioner’s investigation and Decision Notice 23. On 14 September 2015 the Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner about the manner in which his request for information had been handled. 24. During the course of the Information Commissioner’s subsequent investigation, the RQIA returned to its earlier reliance on FOIA section 36. It argued (in a letter to the Information Commissioner dated 23 November 2015) that, in respect of those parts of the First Part that were not exempted by virtue of section 42, it should not be required to disclose:“preliminary, and thus incomplete, dialogue and/or records regarding the regulation and registration of registered individuals” because “Disclosure of information which reflects early and incomplete consideration of courses of action will limit the ability to have relevant and appropriate internal consultation”. The RQIA went on, in the same letter, to reiterate its reliance on section 40 in respect of the Second Part and to provide further information in support of its claim that section 14 applied to the Third Part. 25. The Information Commissioner considered the claim to exemption under FOIA section 36(2)(b)(ii) in the context of all the withheld information relating to the continued registration of the Owner. He found that the “qualified person” for the purpose of section 36 was Glenn Houston, who at the time was the Chief Executive of the RQIA. He had direct involvement in the handling of the information request from the outset and had, in fact, been the signatory of the letter of 21 November 2014 referred to above. The Information Commissioner was satisfied that the position Mr Houston held meant that he would have been familiar with the contents of the records falling within the request for information, even though no detail had been provided as to particular information made available to him. He also found that the opinion, although given verbally and not recorded, was to the effect that the withheld information under the First Part recorded “preliminary and thus incomplete dialogue…and would not necessarily provide an accurate reflection of the RQIA’s final position” and that the ability of RQIA’s staff to freely and frankly exchange views on matters such as a care home owner’s registration in the future would be curtailed by the knowledge that the record of such exchanges might be disclosed. 26. The Information Commissioner concluded that the opinion, as so reported to him, was reasonable, even though the process for obtaining it had been flawed. 27. Having reached the conclusion that the exemption was engaged, the Information Commissioner decided not to consider whether the First Part might also have been exempt under any other limb of section 36, but went on to consider the public interest balance under FOIA section 2(2)(b). In that regard he gave due weight to the qualified person’s reasonable opinion that disclosure would have a chilling effect on the exchange of views both within RQIA and between the organisation and other organisations and service providers. Against that he balanced the acknowledged public interest in greater transparency for the benefit of current and future users of care home facilities, as well as their families. He concluded that, although once the Report had been completed and published, the public interest in maintaining the exemption was less than it would otherwise have been, it was sufficient to outweigh the public interest in disclosure, bearing in mind the possible chilling effect on investigations conducted by the RQIA. 28. Some of the information falling within the scope of the First Part was found also to be covered by FOIA section 42, as it constituted communications which had, as their dominant purpose, the seeking and providing of legal advice. The Information Commissioner found the exemption to be engaged in respect of this information and the public interest in preserving the principle of client confidentiality to outweigh the public interest in the disclosure of information, even though disclosure would help the public understand the RQIA’s decision-making processes.29. As regards the Second Part, the Information Commissioner concluded that, as the withheld information related to an individual’s interview and employment procedures, it should be treated as personal data. He concluded that, in light of the individual’s reasonable expectations of privacy, an order for disclosure would constitute unwarranted interference with that individual’s data protection rights. Balanced against those rights, the legitimate interest in full disclosure of the selection process of a public servant was not so great, (in the absence of credible grounds for concern over the particular appointment in question), to outweigh the detriment which might be caused to the data subject, if disclosure were ordered. 30. Finally, the Information Commissioner assessed the level of disruption, irritation or distress caused to the RQIA by all the information requests submitted by the Appellant over a two-year period leading up to the submission of the Third Part. He set that against the importance of the issues arising from the findings recorded in the Report, but concluded that the point had been reached where the actions taken by the Appellant, and the associated burden imposed on the RQIA, was disproportionate to the objective that the Appellant was attempting to achieve. The information requests in the Third Part were therefore vexatious and the RQIA had been entitled to reject them on that basis. The Appeal to this Tribunal 31. On 25 April 2016 the Appellant lodged with this Tribunal an appeal against the Decision Notice. The grounds of his appeal were supplemented by a letter to the Tribunal dated 6 May 2016 (the Notice of Appeal did little more than to record his disagreement with the Decision Notice). The letter complained that the Information Commissioner had communicated with the RQIA during the investigation without informing the Appellant of the arguments and information it had submitted. It also criticised the investigation which underlay the Report, (on the ground that it left the RQIA investigating its own conduct), as well as the RQIA’s perceived reluctance to implement recommendations in the Report or to disclose relevant records on a matter of such public interest. 32. Faced with such, relatively uninformative, Grounds of Appeal the Information Commissioner’s written Response to the Appeal simply joined issue with the Appellant’s assertion that the Information Commissioner had failed to give proper weight to the public interest factors in favour of disclosure. 33. The RQIA was joined to the Appeal as Second Respondent, under a Case Management Note issued by the Tribunal Registrar on 31 May 2016. On 8 July 2016 the RQIA submitted an informal, undated document by way of Response, which commented on each passage of the Appellant’s 6 May 2016 letter. In essence it relied upon the submissions and information which it had sent to the Information Commissioner on 23 November 2015, during his investigation, annexing a copy of the letter to the Response. The letter made a number of points, the most relevant of which were as follows: a. The RQIA regularly published on its website reports on all the inspections it made of regulated service providers, including information about enforcement actions;b. Release of the background materials sought by the Appellant under the First Part would set a precedent, which would discourage appropriate exchanges of view between the RQIA and its legal advisers; c. Preliminary views expressed between those considering the continued registration of care home owners would not necessarily provide an accurate reflection of the RQIA’s final position on the issue and would hamper internal consultation; d. With regard to the Second Part the letter read: “Information relating to the appointment of a member of staff, their previous employment, is clearly exempt from disclosure by virtue of section 40 of the FOIA. Release of such information, in the absence (or, in this instance, refusal) of consent from the data subject would be a clear, and actionable, breach of the Data Protection Act (1998)” e. The Third Part was dealt with by a detailed review of each item of information, an account of earlier information requests in relation to each and a summary of the efforts made by the RQIA to answer the Appellant’s questions and respond to his criticisms. This was accompanied by submissions on: i. the burden placed on the RQIA by the Appellant’s many information requests ii. the persistence with which the Appellant pursued his requests (and on occasions resurrected earlier ones); and iii. the frequency of information requests and the extent to which they tended to overlap with one another. 34. The Appeal was determined, at the Appellant’s request, at a hearing. The Appellant represented himself. Neither the Information Commissioner nor the RQIA was formally represented, although both arranged for members of staff to attend in the capacity of observer. In the event one of the RQIA’s representative, Mr Johnston from its Directorate of Legal Services did volunteer some information on some aspects of the case. 35. We were provided with an open bundle of materials, which included the parties’ written submissions and copy correspondence passing between the parties prior to, and during the course of, the Information Commissioner’s investigation. The RQIA also prepared an un-paginated and un-indexed bundle (“Closed Bundle A”) containing copies of: a. Documents which had been withheld in full; and b. Unredacted copies of documents that had previously been disclosed in redacted form. Due to the fact that Closed Bundle A was provided only in electronic form, and a late discovered problem with opening the electronic copy provided, it was not available to the Tribunal panel until the day of the hearing. As a consequence, the panel re- convened at a later date in order to review both those materials and the additional information referred to below. This contributed to, but was not the sole reason for, the delay in reaching a final determination, for which we apologise. 36. We were also provided on the day with a bundle of documents (“Closed Bundle B”), which was said to represent the information falling within the scope of the First Part and all that was said to be available at that point in relation to Second Part.37. In the following paragraphs we deal, in turn, with each part of the information request. We set out the arguments and evidence presented (both during, and since, the hearing), together with the conclusions we have reached. First Part – information on the decision to maintain the Owner’s registration. Exemption under FOIA section 42 38. As mentioned above, Closed Bundle B contains a copy of the documents falling within the scope of the First Part. We deal below with each document without disclosing the withheld information itself (although further information is set out in the Confidential Annexes to this decision): a. Tab 1: Manuscript notes dated 20 January 2015 and headed “Legal Advice”. i. It is clear, from both the heading of the document and the matters it records as having been discussed, that the document attracts legal advice privilege. ii. We have set out in the Confidential Annex A to this decision additional reasons for concluding that the section 42 exemption is engaged. b. Tab 2: A document headed “Cherry Tree House – Review of Regulatory History – Version 7, 20 January 2015” (“the Draft Review”). i. It was explained to us by Mr Johnston that this document was created as part of a “look back” exercise, in which the RQIA considered the follow up action required in response to the content of the Report. ii. For the reasons set out in Confidential Annex B, we are satisfied that no part of this document is entitled to legal professional privilege and accordingly the section 42 exemption does not apply to it. c. Tab 3: A table of “Actions”, with a date set against each (“the Action List”), which according to a note at the start of the document formed part of the “look back” exercise. For the reasons given in Confidential Annex A we consider that, provided a minor redaction is made (also identified in the Confidential Annex), this document does not fall within the section 42 exemption. d. Tab 4 is a memorandum of advice, which clearly consists entirely of legal advice provided to the RQIA and falls within the scope of the section 42 exemption. Public Interest Balance under section 42 38. As section 42 creates a qualified exemption it is necessary, next, to consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption in respect of the information contained in the documents at tabs 1 and 4 and in the relevant part of the document at tab 3, outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 39. Our starting point has been to acknowledge that significant weight should be given to the public interest in preserving the freedom of public authorities to receive legal advice in confidence and to preserve the confidence of any instructions or information passed to a lawyer in order to obtain such advice. This has been commented on in several cases – see DBERR v O’Brien and Information Commissioner [2009] EWHC 164 (QB) at paragraph 48. We consider that added weight arises from the circumstances of this case, in which a regulator sought legal advice on the exercise of potentially draconian enforcement rights against a commercial organisation. Against that we have set the serious concerns we have recorded inConfidential Annex B about the RQIA’s response to the Report and the actions it took in light of its findings. The detail appears in the Confidential Annex as part of our analysis of the application of the section 36 exemption to the parts of the withheld information that do not fall within the scope of section 42. However, those concerns also have an impact (albeit reduced)on the information currently under consideration. Our detailed review of the documents at tabs 1 and 4 has demonstrated to us that their disclosure would not contribute in any significant way to any public debate regarding the performance by the RQIA of its duties. We find no reason to criticise the RQIA for the manner in which it took legal advice. Our criticism goes to the manner in which, in light of all the materials available to it, the RQIA approached the task of deciding what action it should take. 40. We conclude, therefore, that the public interest in disclosing the particular information to which the section 42 exemption applies does not reach the threshold of being at least equal to the public interest in maintaining the exemption. It is therefore outweighed by that public interest and the information to which we have applied the exemption should not be disclosed. Exemption under FOIA section 36 41. We turn now to consider the Draft Review at tab 2 and the main part of the Action List at tab 3, to which the section 42 exemption does not apply. The basis for arguing that the Draft Review falls within the exemption, as expressed by the RQIA in its submissions to the Tribunal, was that the premature disclosure of preliminary views would have a chilling effect on the decision-making process. 42. As we have recorded above, the Information Commissioner decided that, although the process by which Mr Houston formed his opinion that disclosure of these materials would undermine the free and frank exchange of views within the RQIA was flawed, the opinion was nevertheless a reasonable one to have formed in the circumstances. 43. We have set out in Confidential Annex B to this decision various findings of fact which we have made as to the manner in which the RQIA responded to the Report, based on our inspection of the withheld information and the RQIA’s response to a request for clarification, which the Tribunal sent, after the hearing, on a closed basis. As a result of those findings we have concluded: a. the RQIA has not established to our satisfaction that any opinion was provided by a qualified person, for the purpose of section 36; and, even if wrong on that issue b. the circumstances we have described demonstrate that the opinion could not have been a reasonable one whether it applied to FOIA section 362(2)(b) or (c). Accordingly, the section 36 exemption is not engaged and the information in the Second Part should be disclosed. 44. If we were to be found on appeal to have been wrong on the engagement of Section 36 we would say that the public interest in maintaining the exemption does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. We reach that conclusion, as explained in Confidential Annex B, on the basis of both the contents of the documents, the processby which they appear to have come into existence and the evidence they provide about the RQIA’s conduct of its “look back” response to the findings of the Report. Second Part – information relating to the appointment of the Manager 45. The letter of 31 July 2015, which rejected this part of the information request, did so in these terms: “The information you have requested in respect of the appointment of an RQIA Inspector is confidential personal information and in my qualified opinion is exempted under Section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act (Personal Information)” 46. The Information Commissioner subsequently decided that the section 40 exemption was engaged. The Decision Notice first recorded the factual basis for that conclusion in these terms (paragraph 38): “The information … relates to an individual’s employment by the RQIA, specifically details of the interview and shortlisting process surrounding this. The Commissioner is satisfied that information relating to an individual’s interview and employment procedures is personal data in accordance with section 1 of the DPA” Later in the Decision Notice consideration was given to whether disclosure might impart to the public information that was relevant to “controversies or credible allegations” (paragraph 46) so as to justify what would otherwise be an unwarranted interference into the Manager’s privacy. The conclusion was then recorded (paragraph 48) in these terms: “Having taken into account all the circumstances of the case, and having considered the reasonable expectations of the data subject, the potential consequences of disclosure, and any public interest factors, the Commissioner has concluded that there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure which would outweigh any detriment which might be caused to the data subject as a result of disclosure of the requested information.” 47. The Tribunal asked the RQIA, in advance of the hearing, to provide a closed bundle of the withheld information. It was not made available in time for the hearing because, we were told at the hearing, the organisation to which the RQIA had outsourced its archiving function could not locate the relevant file. 48. That response demonstrated, to our surprise, that the RQIA had not apparently searched for any potentially relevant materials before rejecting the information request in the terms that it did. And, equally surprising, the Information Commissioner had not asked to see the withheld information before making the decision recorded above. We quite fail to see how that decision could have been reached without having considered whether those who selected the Manager for the role of inspector were aware of a previous connection with the Care Home and, if aware, whether the information formed any part of their deliberations. The Appellant had, of course, made very clear his feelings that previous involvement with an organisation which had subsequently been heavily criticised (in the Report) should have been rigorously investigated during the selection process. A very specific public interest factor had therefore been brought to the InformationCommissioner’s attention and the Decision Notice contains an error in recording that a balance had been struck between that factor and the impact on the individual, when the reality was that the materials which would have shown how the relevant part of the Manager’s employment history had been dealt with had not been seen, or even called for. 49. Immediately after the hearing the Tribunal asked the RQIA to continue the search for “the material covered by the second part of the information request” and ultimately received a set of copy documents identified by the RQIA as “relevant recruitment records”. As they constitute the disputed information we have treated them as closed material which has not been made available to the Appellant, in order to avoid pre- judging the issue we have to decide. 50. The papers had not been assembled into a paginated or indexed bundle but consisted of the following: i. A document entitled “desirable criteria”; ii. The Manager’s completed application form, with attachments; iii. A document entitled “Chairperson’s Checklist for Shortlisting (Guidelines)”; iv. The shortlisting process documentation, showing the identity of each applicant for the relevant post and recording the extent that each one satisfied the shortlisting criteria; v. A document scheduling the interviews, identifying each individual to be interviewed by name; vi. A completed interview assessment form in respect of the Manager, identifying each member of the panel by name and incorporating their comments and scoring against each criteria; vii. A series of “score sheets” recording each (named) candidate’s score against each criteria and in the aggregate; viii. Documentation recording the taking up of references in respect of the Manager; ix. A document containing the detailed job description for the post under consideration; x. A copy of the advertisement to which the individual responded; xi. A document entitled “Personnel Specification” in respect of the position applied for; xii. A copy of the terms and conditions of employment; xiii. Communications about the Manager’s pre-employment health assessment, identifying the individual by name; xiv. Correspondence with the Manager regarding the outcome of the application process and her ultimate appointment to the position of Inspector. 51. It will immediately be apparent from those descriptions that several of the documents are generic materials and our own inspection of them satisfied us that they do not contain any information about any individual. They are therefore incapable of forming, or containing, the personal data of any individual. They clearly fall within the scope of the Second Part of the information request and should therefore be disclosed. The material covered by that assessment comprises items i., iii. and ix. – xi. inclusive.52. It is also clear that the RQIA has limited its search to the file of the Manager’s application. Yet the Second Part also seeks generic information, not specific to, or likely to disclose personal data about, any individual. It includes: a. “All records surrounding …the short-listing process” – it is not clear to us if any search has been carried out for generic information about how the process was to be conducted, (either generally in accordance with the organisation’s HR policies or by reference to this particular recruitment exercise), or for any instruction or guidance that was given in writing to those due to carry out the process. Given the clear terms of the direction which the Tribunal gave in its Case Management Note and the description which the RQIA itself gave to the materials provided, all emanating from one individual’s recruitment file, we conclude that the RQIA failed to carry out a wider search either at the time of the original information request or following receipt of the Tribunal’s direction. b. “…the interview process…” – the same conclusion applies to this category of information as is set out under sub-paragraph a. above. But in this case we have, in addition, already seen (item vi. above) that the interview panel members wrote their comments onto a form that identified the selection criteria. Any retained copy of a blank form clearly falls within the scope of the information request and would not, in our view, disclose the personal data of any individual, either job applicant or selection panel member. c. “…how many were shortlisted…” – this is just a number which may very easily be extracted from item v. above. 53. It might be said (although it has not been so argued by the RQIA up to this moment) that even generic materials that relate to the role of Inspector are capable of comprising the personal data of the Manager when released in response to an information request that identified that individual as the focus of the request. Against that it may be argued that the role of an RQIA Inspector is a public office and the advertisement identified as item x. in our list above invited potential applicants to request an “application pack”. The effect of that was to put into the public domain generic information about the position which the individual applied for. It is, we suspect, unlikely that this would have included the more specific information contained in a blank interview assessment form (item vi. in our list) but it would certainly have included a reasonably detailed job description. 54. These considerations lead us to direct the RQIA to carry out a search for generic information, covered by the information request and retained elsewhere than in the individual’s recruitment file. The RQIA will be conscious, when making that search, of the comments we have made above about the inadequacy of its original, limited search. It should then notify the Appellant and the Tribunal, within 35 days of the date of this decision, whether it holds the requested information. It should at the same time either disclose the information or notify the Appellant and Tribunal of any exemption it wishes to rely on to justify non-disclosure. Further directions will then be given for resolving any dispute that may arise at that stage as to the application of the exemption or exemptions relied on.55. As regards the documents identified in our list as items ii., iv. - viii. inclusive and xii. – xiv., inclusive we are satisfied, having reviewed the documents, that they include the personal date of the Manager and of other individuals such as other applicants and the interview panel members. Had we been minded to direct disclosure we would have required those individuals’ names to be redacted, in any event. 56. In the case of the Manager, we have taken into account the Appellant’s particular concern, as described above, and have reviewed the extent to which that part of the Manager’s employment history was disclosed in the application form and thereafter taken into account during the selection process. We have a concern about one aspect of the process and expand upon that in Confidential Annex A to this decision. However, having taken into consideration the date of the application (2007), the period of review covered by the Report (2005 - 2013) and the matters raised and responded to during the selection process, we have not come across any information which has led us to believe that the public consideration of the issues that causes the Appellant concern would be better informed, to any significant extent, by disclosure of the information in those documents. Nor have we identified any other public interest that might be served by disclosure. Against that, the Manager would have a reasonable expectation that employment records would retain confidentiality, particularly in the case of materials recording matters raised during a job interview. Disclosure would, therefore, constitute an unwarranted interference in individual privacy and would not be justified by any public interest in disclosure of these particular materials. Third Part – information said to represent a vexatious information request 57. We derive guidance on the application of section 14 from the Upper Tribunal case of Information Commissioner v Devon CC and Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC)1. We have approached this part of the appeal with the following passage from Dransfield firmly in mind: “27. The common theme underpinning section 14(1), at least insofar as it applies on the basis of a past course of dealings between the public authority and a particular requester, has been identified by Judge Jacobs as being a lack of proportionality (in his refusal of permission to appeal in Wise v Information Commissioner GIA/1871/2011; see paragraph 17 above). This issue was also identified by the recent FTT in Lee v Information Commissioner and King’s College Cambridge at [73] as a relevant consideration. … I agree with the overall conclusion that the FTT in Lee reached, namely that “vexatious” connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” (at [69]).” 58. Upper Tribunal Judge Wikely went on to identify four questions which he suggested might help those considering whether or not a request was truly vexatious. They were: i. How great a burden did the request impose on the public authority and its staff? ii. What was the requester’s motive? iii. Did the request have value or a serious purpose? 1 Subsequently approved, in substantial part, by the Court of Appeal - [2015] EWCA Civ 454iv. Was there any evidence of the requester harassing staff members or causing them distress? However, he also made it clear that those considerations were not intended to be exhaustive and that they should not be treated as a formulaic check-list. 59. Unlike the material falling within the First Part and Second Part, the information falling within the Third Part all relates to the preparation of the Report and not the conduct of the “look back” review which resulted from it. The publication of the Report certainly appears to have caused genuine concern to the Appellant and others, a factor which we should take into account when considering whether the Third Part should have been refused under FOIA section 14. 60. Having made those general points, we review each element of the Third Part (as set out in full in paragraph 9above) in turn. (b) All records maintained by the project manager of the independent review covered by the Report 61. The Appellant previously requested (by letter dated 22 September 2014) “all communications between [the project manager] or anyone else within RQIA or with the Review Team.”. Subsequently, on 23 October 2014 he commented that the same individual had written two detailed emails to the Review Team in April 2014 from which he inferred that the writer would also have kept notes. He asked for copies of all such notes and records. 62. The letter from the RQIA of 21 November 2014, in which it was asserted (see paragraph 7 above) that the Appellant’s information requests had become vexatious, sought to address a large number of outstanding information requests. It addressed materials authored by the project manager by specific reference to the 23 October 2014 request, stating that: “These notes and records are exempted under section 36(2)(c) and section 36(5)(L) of the Freedom of Information Act (2000).” The reliance on those exemptions was not challenged by the Appellant. During the hearing he said that he did not pursue the point because he lacked confidence in the freedom of information processes, as operated by the RQIA and the Information Commissioner. 63. We have considered whether any developments occurred between the date of the rejection of the first two requests in November 2014 and the date of the information request we are considering, which would justify the Appellant effectively repeating his information request in July 2015. We have seen none in the papers provided to us and the Appellant did not rely on any such changes that might be said to have justified his persistence. 64. We have concluded that the Appellant’s decision, to ignore the statement by the RQIA that it relied on the section 36 exemption and then to repeat what was effectively the same request several months later, represented a disproportionate and manifestly unjustified use of the freedom of information mechanisms. Those mechanisms balance the right to have information disclosed against a public authority’s right to rely on exemptions in certain circumstances. To allow thoserequesting information to continue to assert their right to information, by submitting repeat requests, without at any time addressing the public authority’s counter- assertion of its right to rely upon an exemption previously identified represents a misuse of those mechanisms. (b) Records of meetings when a draft of the Report was made available to certain organisations 65. On 18 June 2014 the Appellant submitted a very wide request for all communications between the RQIA and the review team both before, during and after the investigation. Some information was disclosed to him in response to that request but section 36 was relied on as the basis for refusing to disclose more. In this case a separate record of the qualified person’s opinion was prepared, signed by Mr Houston and made available to the Appellant. The opinion made specific reference to the difficulties that were anticipated to arise if drafts of the Report were to be disclosed, revealing early consideration of issues dealt with in the final version. This followed earlier correspondence in which the RQIA had tried to address the Appellant’s concern that drafts of the Report had been shared with organisations and individuals likely to be affected by its findings. Although the Appellant criticised this process in correspondence with the RQIA, he informed us during the hearing that he was familiar with the “Maxwellisation” process, (a confidential procedure whereby individuals criticized in an official inquiry are given the opportunity to read relevant sections of a draft report of the inquiry and challenge or object to the critical findings before a final version is published.) 66. The Appellant was justified in having concerns about the management of the Care Home and the performance by the RQIA of its role as regulator. However, it was not proportionate or justified to pursue those concerns by raising a request, in July 2015, which covered information which falls within the scope of a properly reasoned refusal ten months previously, particularly as he had not in the meantime tried to challenge that refusal. The RQIA was entitled to have the grounds of its refusal debated and, if necessary, disputed through the procedures created under the FOIA, rather than have its staff put through the effort of having to repeat the refusal process in the face of a later request that was phrased in slightly different terms, but covered the same material. If not entitled to rely on section 14 in these circumstances public authorities could find themselves pressured by the harassment of repeat requests into disclosing information which the law gives them the legal right to claim exemption. (c) Water-marked copies of the Report 67. The reasons set out above for refusing disclosure of meeting reports coming into existence during the Maxwellisation process apply with equal effect to the copies of the draft of the Report that were made available at, or in preparation for, those meetings. (d) Other organisations’ feedback on a draft of the Report 68. The Appellant explained in written submissions filed with the Tribunal that the reason for requiring this part of his information request to be answered was that he perceived that changes had been made to the Report after it has been shown in draftto public bodies who had been investigated. We have already commented on the Appellant’s understanding of the “Maxwellisation” process 69. This part of the information request arose, originally, from a letter which the Appellant sent to the RQIA on 25 July 2014. He raised a number of questions about the sending of drafts to organisations which had been subject to investigation. He included requests for copies of the relevant drafts and of responses received. 70. The requests overlapped with others made both before and after that date. The RQIA, by letter dated 30 July 2014, objected to disclosure of any of the requested information regarding the draft, relying on FOIA section 36 (b)(i) and (ii). The letter also explained that the only purpose of making a draft available to people outside the investigation team was to enable factual errors to be detected. It did not detract from the fact that the review team had taken sole responsibility for the content and conclusions of the Report. The letter concluded by telling the Appellant that if he was dissatisfied with the response he could request that it be subjected to internal review. 71. We have not been able to identify, among the substantial body of correspondence passing between the Appellant and the RQIA around this time, any response from the Appellant to the invitation to seek an internal review. However, on 12 September 2014 the RQIA wrote to him to say that, on further reflection of its first response, it had decided to provide him with a list of all the changes made to the draft of the Report between the penultimate version (dated April 2014) and the final version (dated July 2014). The list took the form of a lengthy table setting out all the text that had been removed and/or added to each paragraph of the draft. It led to a further information request from the Appellant, set out in a letter dated 19 September 2014, seeking information about the versions compared in creating the table, and the significance of certain meeting he understood had taken place during the summer of 2014. The letter also raised a further 4 information requests on points of detail. Additional items of information were sought in follow up letters from the Appellant dated 22 and 24 September 2014. Although each of the letters raised further points of detail, none of them sought to pursue the original refusal, by means of an internal review, or otherwise. Neither did they comment on any of the specific changes to the draft of the Report, as recorded in the table which the RQIA had prepared. 72. The Appellant’s approach at this stage, under which he developed further information requests from any information that was made available to him, is evidence of the sort of obsessive, harassing behaviour frequently relied on to support a finding that a subsequent request was vexatious. It cannot be said that the later requests arose from the detailed information set out in the table of changes. That sort of “drilling down” into more detailed information may sometimes be justified in pursuing a legitimate cause, (as in this case). But there was no evidence of it here – the Appellant just switched his attention from the information that had been supplied to another line of enquiry that was related, but not subsidiary, to the original question. 73. On that basis, notwithstanding the serious concerns the Appellant has regarding the Care Home, we would have been sympathetic to the stance adopted in the RQIA’s letter of 21 November 2014, in which it informed the Appellant that it would rely on FOIA section 14 to refuse any further information requests. We are satisfied that thetable of changes had provided the information the Appellant needed to identify whether any third parties had caused the content of the draft of the Report to be varied and, if so, the extent of any changes. He had been notified at that stage that section 36 was relied on for the other information he requested. He did not challenge the stance taken at any time but simply re-submitted the relevant part of his request several months later. 74. We have concluded that the manner in which the Appellant pursued this part of his information request rendered it a vexatious request for the purposes of FOIA section 14. Conclusion 75. The RQIA was therefore entitled to rely on FOIA section 14 in refusing the Third Part of the information request. However, with the exception of the material exempted under section 42, as described above, the rest of the requested information should have been disclosed. The appeal in respect of those parts of the Decision Notice therefore succeeds. 76.

"2","EIR","EA/2019/0240 - P Between: WARRENPOINT HARBOUR AUTHORITY Appellant: and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent: And LIAM ELLISON Second Respondent: Tribunal: Sitting at R.C.J. Belfast on 9 January 2020 & Tele Conference on 3 & 4 April 2020. Panel: Judge Brian Kennedy QC Ms Anne Chafer Mr Paul Taylor Appearances: Appellant: Michael Egan B.L. of Counsel Kieran Grant Representative of Appellant. Second Respondent: Liam Ellison – Litigant in Person. Result: Appeal allowed. 1Decision with Reasons Introduction: [1] This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner, the First Respondent, (“the Commissioner”) contained in her Decision Notice dated 12 June 2019 (reference FS50798810), which is a matter of public record. Factual Background to this Appeal: [2] Full details of the background to this appeal, the request for information and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice (“DN”). The appeal concerns the question of whether the Commissioner was correct to determine that the Appellant “Harbour Authority” had failed sufficiently to demonstrate that the information was protected by commercial sensitivity. CHRONOLOGY: 5 Sept 2018 Request for details of contractual or license partners of Warrenpoint Harbour 5 Oct 2018 Trust refuses, citing s43 FOIA, requests some clarification but does not offer an internal review 31 Oct 2018 Requester complains to Commissioner [3] RELEVANT LEGISLATION: Freedom of Information Act 2000 Section 43 Commercial interests. (1) Information is exempt information if it constitutes a trade secret. (2) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (including the public authority holding it). 2(3) The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the extent that, compliance with section 1(1)(a) would, or would be likely to, prejudice the interests mentioned in subsection (2) above. COMMISSIONER’S DECISION NOTICE: [4] The Second Respondent; Mr Ellison’s request to the Harbour Authority read as follows: i. The names of all companies/organisations who were in contract….or had licensed agreements with Warrenpoint Harbour Authority during the period July 2008 and January 2018; ii. The commencement date and duration of the contracts/licensed agreements….; iii....specify the port authorities which were utilized in respect of each of the individual contacts or licensed agreements, for example, access to open level facilities or storage sheds that were made available as part of the contract(s) or licensed agreement; iv. The recorded turnover of volume in tonnes over the duration of each contract/licensed agreement; v. The Port Authorities stated requirements in relation to each contract i.e. licensing, insurance, health and safety and environmental protection. [5] Mr Ellison explained to the Commissioner that he did not want to know specific financial arrangements between the Harbour Authority and the users of the harbour, but rather he was seeking to establish the number of contracts issued, their duration and renewals so as to ensure the equal application of the appropriate regulations. The Harbour Authority stated that disclosing the withheld information would prejudice both its ability to continue a commercially viable operation and also the commercial interests of its customers. The harm to the Harbour Authority was described as damage to reputation, limiting its ability to enter future advantageous contracts. The customers would face having their confidential commercial and contractual arrangements made public. [6] The Commissioner viewed the withheld material, and informed the Harbour Authority that she considered the information to be “fairly mundane” and requested further evidence on how the material would cause the damage alleged. The Harbour Authority provided information from two customers arguing that the requested information would allow competitors to draw conclusions about turnover, costs and capacities. The Commissioner noted that the withheld information did not contain any details on financial turnover or 3costs, and she did not see how any competitors could use the volume turnover in tonnage. As the onus was on the Public authority to prove the applicability of s43, the Commissioner was not satisfied that the commercial interests of either the Harbour Authority or its contractual partners would be harmed by the disclosure, and so ordered that the information be released. She also criticised the Harbour Authority for failing to offer an internal review, in accordance with the s45 code of practice. GROUNDS OF APPEAL: [7] The Harbour Authority has limited its appeal solely to the information in respect of the customer specific tonnage turnover, agreeing to disclose the rest of the material outlined at parts 1-3 and 5 of the request. It argued that specific tonnage turnover as requested, was akin to financial turnover as it reveals a level of business activity that is “patently commercially sensitive” and could allow competitors to derive financial turnover in certain markets based on commodities with fairly standardised prices. The Commissioner was provided with statements from two customers who gave specific details as to how the disclosure would harm their business. The Harbour Authority relied especially on a statement from Dara O’Reilly, Chief Financial Officer of Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd, in which Mr O’Reilly raised concerns that competitors could use the information to determine whether the company’s sales volume had dropped below a commercially viable level, and then strategically target its customers with lower prices. This may drive Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd out of its arrangement with the Harbour. It argued that, for those reasons, the exemption was applicable and the public interest lay in protecting the information. [8] The Finance Director of the Harbour Authority, Kieran Grant, also provided a statement to the effect that there are twelve competitor ports on the island of Ireland and the cost of transportation between them is a “negligible” consideration when selecting a port. He also added that only three ports on the island are subject to FOIA, and any disclosure made under FOIA would leave the port’s market position “significantly weakened”. COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE: [9] The Commissioner stated that nothing in the Harbour Authority’s initial or subsequent submissions dislodged her original belief that disclosure would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests as alleged. She reminded herself of the steps elucidated in Hogan and Oxford City Council v Information Commissioner EA/2008/0092: 4vi. Identify the applicable interests; vii. Identify the nature of the prejudice i.e. prove it to be real and causally linked to disclosure; and viii. Assess the likelihood of prejudice. [10] The Commissioner questioned how the requested information would allow competitors to determine a realistic estimate of profit without knowing other costs of business. She also observed that competitors were also already likely to be able to estimate volumes of goods passing through the port merely by observation, particularly if they too are based there. She invited the Harbour Authority to provide further information to establish the causal link between the disclosure and any prejudice, but noted that the following factors weighed most heavily in convincing her that the exemption was not engaged: ix. the historical nature of some of the information at the date of request; x. the fluctuations in commodity prices; xi. the issue of transportation costs impacting decisions, a matter that would not be impacted by disclosure; and xii. the information disclosed from the Appellant’s accounts. REQUESTER’S RESPONSE: [11] Mr Ellison explained that concern for accountability and oversight was related to the absence of a functioning local government in Northern Ireland at the time of the request and the attendant lack of scrutiny of public authorities. His purpose was to ensure that the Harbour Authority was abiding by its own statutory obligation to ensure that anyone trading through the port shall have written permission from the Chief Executive. He agreed with the Commissioner that the tonnage information would not prejudice any present commercial interest as his request is for historical information of actual volume, not tonnage projected or estimated at the point that the contract was signed. He cited Derry City Council v ICO EA/2006/0014 to support his argument that the age of the information can diminish its commercial sensitivity. [12] Mr Ellison also provided documents relating to his own business to show that because of “variation and range in price… without having knowledge and insights into other costs and overheads it would be impossible to link a gross tonnage figure to a constantly 5changing price structure”. He also added that much more information is available for publicly traded companies that also use the port. Prior to the hearing, Mr Ellison also provided the Tribunal with copies of the Harbour Authority’s Annual Reports for 2015 and 2016, together with the Economic Impact Statement from September 2017, all of which publish specific information about the contractual arrangements with, and tonnage of cement exported by, Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd. Similar information was published in relation to the passage of grain, wood pellets and coal through the port, along with the roll on/roll off figures for the company ‘Seatruck’. The information, he argued, could hardly be considered commercially sensitive per se if the Harbour Authority is disclosing it voluntarily in its Annual Report. [13] He stated that the risks of losing customers was overstated, as the choice to use Warrenpoint Harbour would have been a balance of the various costs or transport, service, facilities, management, support and infrastructure. The use of other comparable ports would cause significant, not negligible, increases in transportation costs for some of the businesses in question. [14] Mr Ellison argued that the information should be considered environmental information under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, but subsequently accepted that FOIA was the appropriate legislative framework for his request following submissions by all parties on the applicability of FOIA or EIR, further to the Directions of the Tribunal following its permission to adjourn the initial oral hearing. APPELLANT’S REPLY [15] The Appellant added that causal relationship between disclosure and the alleged prejudice has been amply demonstrated through the statements of the customers and nothing could be done to mitigate the effects of the disclosure. From Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd it was argued that disclosure of the tonnage information would allow competitors to calculate minimum viable loads. ReGen Ltd stated that tonnage information would allow competitors to calculate its reclamation percentage of recyclable material from waste processed. This is because the total tonnage of processed waste is public knowledge. [16] Furthermore, any public interest in transparency and accountability in the management of the port would not be met by the disclosure of this very specific material. There is no wider public interest in the disclosure of this material, and it was asserted that 6Mr Ellison, who was, at the time, negotiating the use of port facilities for a client, had requested the material. HEARING: [17] Prior to the hearing, Mr Ellison complained that contrary to the Harbour Authorities assurances that it would disclose to him the non-contentious portions of his request; he had not received fulsome disclosure. In particular, he complained that the information that had been disclosed would not enable him to identify which organisations had contracts with the Harbour Authority, distinct from those with licensed agreements. At the oral hearing he also stated that in the information he had been given, two companies had been left out. The Harbour Authority disputed this and maintained that it had been given all relevant information held by the authority. [18] Mr Ellison also confirmed that the instant request followed from a previous request of 17th July 2018, in which he named eight companies as being his subjects of interest. He stated that he was not interested in information about Quinn Cement (NI) or Re-Gen, and his focus was concentrated on customers in the steel industry. In response, Mr Egan for the Appellant pointed out that the published figures relates only to Quinn Cement (NI) at a limited point of time, and the information for the preceding and subsequent years had not been published. As to why the information had been published he stated that it would be difficult to find out why as there had been a change in staffing, however in light of the fact that Mr Ellison had effectively excluded Quinn Cement from his request, the fact of publication did not arise. Mr Egan assured the Tribunal that the Harbour Authority no longer publishes information on tonnages. [19] On Thursday 9 January 2020 the Tribunal sat to hear the oral appeal including an application for an Adjournment by the Appellant. After much discussion on the issues in the case generally and exchange between the parties, who found some common ground on reducing the issues between the parties, the Tribunal agreed to adjourn the Appeal to permit the Harbour Authority to investigate Mr Ellison’s submissions about the publication of examples of the requested information in the Annual Reports. The Tribunal directed the 7Harbour Authority to seek further information from any customers who may, or may not give consent to disclosure of information sought in the part 4 of the request (referred to in the Decision Notice under appeal) and to come to an agreement on the legislative framework (F.O.I.A. or E.I.R.). ADDITIONAL SUBMISSIONS: [20] Following the oral hearing, the Harbour Authority canvassed the views of two customers in the steel industry. My Metal Ltd strongly resisted disclosure of the material, citing it as commercially sensitive insofar as it could lead to specific targeting of its company’s market and business. Following Legal advice, Barrett Steel, declined to partake in proceedings. [21] Mr Ellison explained that he had withdrawn his request in relation to Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd and Re Gen only insofar as it related to part 4 of his request. He took issue with the Harbour Authority’s compliance with the direction, stating that it had only canvassed the views of two current steel customers and none of the eight other companies that were mentioned in the disclosed material as having used the port between 2008 and 2018. He also urged the Tribunal to discount the evidence from Mymetal Ltd as according to the Harbour Authority it did not have a licence to occupy during the period covered by the request, and so its commercial interests are not affected by the request. Mr Ellison took great issue with any suggestion that he had any “personal and malicious motive” against the Harbour Authority or any of its customers. [22] The Harbour Authority also provided to the Tribunal a letter sent from Richard Ballantyne, Chief Executive of the British Ports Association, initially sent to the Commissioner following the issue of the Decision Notice. In that letter he raised concerns about the decision, pointing out that during the drafting of the 2002 Freedom of Information (Additional Public Authorities) Order the industry received assurances that the commercial activities of Northern Irish ports would not be subject to FOIA. This would keep it in line with the other ports in GB and RoI. Mr Ellison argued that no such limitation can be found in the statute, and no confirmation has come from government to that effect. TRIBUNAL FINDINGS: 8Applicable Legislative Framework [23] All parties now agree that the appropriate statute under which the request should be considered is the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Commissioner referred to BEIS v IC and Henney [2017] EWCA Civ 844 and DfT, DVSA and Porsche Cars GB Ltd v Information Commissioner and John Cieslik [2018] UKUT 127 (AAC), noting that while the definition at Reg.2 EIR is to be construed broadly, it must not be extended to information which has only a minimal or nominal connection to the environment. In the context of this request, the Commissioner’s view was as follows: Adopting a purposive construction in accordance with the Directive and Aarhus Convention, and considering the guidance provided in the authorities above, the Commissioner does not consider the recorded turnover in tonnes to fall within the purpose of the EIR. This is on the basis that the present request falls more within the scope of the Upper Tribunal’s considerations in Cieslik, rather than Henney, and that the information requested only has a minimal connection with the environment and is therefore not environmental information. The Commissioner considers that whilst other information relating to the transportation of goods could arguably be environmental information, such as information relating to the fuel efficiency of tankers or their emissions, the actual tonnes transported over a contractual period are too remote to amount to environmental information. This is particularly the case given the number of variables that may have a bearing on the environmental impact of the shipping industry. For example the recorded volume in tonnes does not appear to give an accurate indication of the number of tankers used to transport the goods, or the fuel efficiency of the tankers or any discharges into the ocean. The Commissioner therefore considers the recorded turnover in tonnes to not be environmental information, particularly in the context of the request. [24] This approach was adopted by the Harbour Authority and conceded by the requester. We, the Tribunal, also agree with the Commissioner’s reasoning, and will proceed to consider the request under FOIA. Information Disclosed 9[25] Between the issuing of the Decision Notice and the lodging of the Grounds of Appeal, the Harbour Authority agreed to release information pertaining to the majority of the Appellant’s request and appeal only against part 4. The Commissioner’s Decision Notice therefore against parts 1 to 3 and 5 still stands and has not therefore been appealed. Mr Ellison’s legal representatives noted that: “In accordance with good practice and transparency it would be expected that all of the requested information would be recorded in WHA’s documentation…” [26] The Tribunal has observed in other decisions that the fact that a person expects information to be held does not necessarily mean that it actually is or should be. However, following the hearing in Belfast, Mr Ellison clarified that the companies missing from Warrenpoint Harbour Authority’s spreadsheets, as alluded to previously, were Barretts Steel Ireland and Mymetal. The Tribunal note that no response has been made by the Harbour Authority confirming, whether or not information falling under parts 1-3 & 5 in relation to these companies is held. Consequently the Tribunal requires the Harbour Authority to so confirm within 28 days of the date of this decision and to disclose all relevant information where held. [27] The Tribunal also note that Mr Ellison argued before us that he was not able to differentiate between contract information and license information in the Harbour Authority’s disclosed spreadsheets. We note that the request clearly refers to ‘each specific contract/license’; we also note that Mr Ellison had set out an example of the format in which he would prefer to receive the information. The Harbour Authority claims to have disclosed all information held; however, we agree that the spread sheet does not appear to differentiate between contracts and licenses and nor is clear what the start and end dates are for each. The Tribunal therefore requires the Harbour Authority to disclose the requested information in the format indicated by Mr Ellison at p.64; and this should distinguish between contracts and licenses, showing the requested information for both. Section 43(2) Commercial Interests [28] The Tribunal received three-witness statements from three firms whose information would have fallen to be included in the request: Quinn Cement (NI) Ltd, Re-Gen and My Metal Ltd. The first two were chosen by the Harbour Authority to provide information, as 10they were “substantial customers” of the harbour’s facilities. It is of course reasonable to consider these statements, as they will be indicative of the impact on smaller companies. [29] The statement from Mr O’Reilly of Quinn Cement raised the following concerns: xiii. Minimum volumes of goods are required for an operation to be economically viable; xiv.These minimum volumes can be calculated or at least estimated by competitors; xv. Disclosure of the tonnage information could allow competitors aggressively to target customers in specific locations to make other firms’ volumes fall to a level that would not be viable, thereby forcing their withdrawal from the harbour; xvi.The businesses at risk of such targeting are already under significant pressure occasioned by the weakening of the pound, fluctuations in demand and uncertainty surrounding Brexit. [30] Re-Gen shared those concerns and explained how they would have effect on the recycling market. Mymetal Ltd stated that information on tonnage would be expected to remain confidential, and if disclosed could affect competitors’ future commercial strategy and potentially break UK or EU competition laws. [31] Mr Ellison disputed the relevance of Quinn Cement and Re-Gen’s concerns, as he stated that he was not interested in obtaining their information. However, he pointed out that the Harbour Authority had itself published some of the information in its Annual Reports. [32] This Tribunal do not completely accept Mr Egan’s argument that the exclusion of Quinn Cement from the refined request meant that publication no longer had any bearing on the considerations. Vociferous assertions by both the customer and the Harbour Authority that any publication of such information would be damaging to their business must inevitably be weakened by the fact of voluntary publication. This therefore would give rise to doubts about the same assertions being made on behalf of other customers in the absence of industry-specific submissions. However, Mr Egan’s point that what was published was a single year’s tonnage, rather than an unbroken ten-year data set, carries 11more weight. We note that Mr Ellison’s request was for tonnages over the duration of each contract/licensed agreement rather than annual figures. What was published was not the same information. [32] As for the Harbour Authority itself, the concerns boiled down to an assertion that disclosure would make it a less attractive business partner. The Harbour Authority is an independent entity that is not dependent on public funding. Mr Grant explained that the profits of the venture are reinvested in the harbour for maintenance, development and improvement. We found Mr Grant’s evidence particularly persuasive. It is clear that the commercial success of the harbour is essential to ensure its continued operation. The clarity provided by Mr Grant and Mr Ballantyne about the unusual position faced by Northern Irish trust ports being the only trust ports in the UK and Ireland subject to FOIA is a powerful factor in considering whether this would result in unfair ‘asymmetric’ disclosure [Just for clarity, the links to the sites that confirmed that other ports in UK/RoI are not subject to FOIA are : https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/ attachment_data/file/684839/ports-good-governance-guidance.pdf at 2.28 https://www.rte.ie/news/special-reports/2014/0129/501005-freedom-of- information/ ] It is neither fanciful nor unclear how this could lead to potential customers and investors being reluctant to begin or continue commercial relationships with the Harbour Authority if their contractual arrangements are likely to become public. [33] When determining whether prejudice is likely to be occasioned, the Commissioner and the Appellant referred the Tribunal to the Hogan three-point analysis of identifying firstly the interests, then the causal link between disclosure and prejudice, and finally the likelihood of that prejudice. The Tribunal in that decision determined that the phrase “likely to prejudice” means a “more than a hypothetical or remote possibility; there must have been a real and significant risk” (Hogan at [34]). This three stage approach and the explanation of the meaning of ‘likely to prejudice’ was approved by the Court of Appeal in Department for Work and Pensions v Information Commissioner and another [2016] EWCA Civ 758 at [27]. [34] For the Commissioner’s part she remained unconvinced that turnover or capacity could be easily derived from tonnage, or how competitors could use the information. 12[35] The requester had cited in support of his application the Derry City Council case. This case involved a request for release of a contract between Ryanair and the Council who own the City of Derry Airport. The request was made in 2005, and the contract had been signed in 1999. At para.12, the First Tier Tribunal stated as follows: “As we have already stressed, this decision is limited to its particular facts. We do not accept that, in the context of those facts, disclosure, in February 2005, of the redacted detail from a contract entered into in March 1999, would have caused the Airport to gain a reputation as an untrustworthy counterparty in commercial transactions; one that would disclose, or be forced to disclose, the contents of agreements in which it enters. Any person or organisation contracting with it would already know that it was publicly owned and that its commercial dealings would therefore be subjected to greater public scrutiny than those of a private company. Moreover, the disclosure that the Council was asked to make was limited to the release of limited information in respect of a single contract entered into almost six years previously in circumstances where the industry would have been well aware of the interest of both the public and the regulators in agreements with low cost airlines.” The Tribunal went on to find that even with these caveats, the exemption at s43 (2) was engaged, and turned then to consider the public interest test. [36] The present request seeks disclosure not of a single agreement but rather a pattern of the business activities of the harbour’s customers over a ten-year period. Such long-term data would provide a valuable insight into those businesses for their competitors, and as such we consider that there is a real and significant risk of prejudice to the companies whose information would be disclosed. Attendant to that risk to the companies, there is a real and significant risk that companies would seek to avoid such disclosure by turning to the Harbour Authority’s competitors and thereby damage the commercial viability and success of the harbour. We are therefore satisfied that the exemption at s43 (2) is engaged, and turn then to consider the public interest in disclosure. Public Interest: 13[36] The Appellant Harbour Authority submitted that the information would be of no use or relevance to the wider public, and Mr Ellison had requested it in the course of a commercial negotiation/dispute with the Harbour Authority. In its view the public interest weighs more heavily in favour of maintaining the exemption because, inter alia, “there is a public interest in encouraging and avoiding undermining, economic activity and growth in the area in which the Appellant is based”. The Tribunal accept there is significant weight in this submission. The Appellant also properly argued that the fact that the exemption was engaged meant that it was in the public interest to maintain the exemption. The Commissioner did not make any submissions on the public interest test as in her view the exemption had not been engaged. [37] The Requester made a general point regarding the need for transparency and accountability in the management of publicly owned facilities, especially because at the time of his request there had been no devolved government in Northern Ireland. He described the purpose of his request as being to ensure that the relevant by-law prohibiting use of the port for unauthorised trading was being applied consistently. He emphasised the need to “secure an optimal return on public funds” and to scrutinise the “public/private interface” at the harbour. We have not been provided with any tangible evidence to demonstrate grounds for these concerns being currently live or pressing. Mr Ellison also argued that disclosure would allow the public to ensure that there was open competition amongst private providers where they operate alongside the publicly owned Harbour Authority, and measures were being taken to protect the environment and wildlife within the harbour estate. Again we have no evidence of actual concern in these regards. [38] With regard to the last assertion about the environmental protection measures, we do not agree that disclosure of the information would be of relevance. Nor, on the evidence before us, do we consider that the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly had any bearing on part 4 of this request. On the evidence before us we are of the view that the requested information would not be of any live or pressing interest or use to the wider public beyond the competitors of the Harbour Authority and its customers. 14[39] Instead, we consider that the need to ensure the commercial viability of the port has a compelling public interest both for the port itself but also to Warrenpoint and the wider Northern Ireland economy. On the evidence before us, we have been persuaded that Commercial confidence in the port ought not to be dented by disclosure of material that would otherwise be of such limited use. CONCLUSION: [40] For the above reasons we allow the appeal. The withheld information at part 4 of the request is, on the evidence before us, exempt by virtue of s.43 (2) and accordingly the Appellant is not required to disclose it. However, the Appellant must within 28 days confirm to the Second Respondent and the Tribunal whether or not information falling under parts 1-3 & 5 in relation to the identified companies is held and to disclose the information where held. The Appellant must also disclose the information in the format suggested by the requester, distinguishing between contracts and licenses. Brian Kennedy QC 10 April 2020.

Tribunal Members Ms Alison Lowton and Mr David Wilkinson Between Geoffrey Johnston Appellant -and- The Information Commissioner Respondent Sitting at Field House on 12 March 2020 Representation: The Appellant appeared in person The Commissioner was not represented 1DECISION AND REASONS THE REQUEST AND RESPONSE 1. The Appellant made the following request for information on 20 February 2018 to the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council (the Council), as follows: - Re: Fermanagh and Omagh District Council Planning approval for extension – L2012/0676/F via Enforcement Case L/2012/0145/CA 1. ‘The Council is requested to provide a copy of the NIEA or Department’s EIA assessment ‘consultation document’ consenting and approving the removal of the national habitats and ASSI from the shoreline enabling the above approval. 2. Supply the legislative instrument of common law authority that was used to enable the approval to be defined as ‘extension of boat berthing facilities’ at the Moorings Marina. 3. Supply a copy of the Local Planning analysis report that no infringement would be suffered by the neighbouring Moorings Marian by approval of the unauthorised development. 2. On 21 March the Council replied to say that it did not hold the documents requested in requests 1 and 3 and provided the name of the legislation for request 2. An internal review confirmed this position on 29 June 2018. 3. The Appellant pursued the matter to the Commissioner on 14 August 2018, on the basis that he did not think that the Council had fully answered his questions or provided a proper explanation as to the legal basis to support its actions. 4. The Council’s position is that, in relation to request 1 and 3 respectively, the NIEA (the Northern Ireland Environment Agency) was not consulted on the application referred to as it was not a development which fell within the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations (EIA Regulations); and that there was no ‘Local Planning Analysis Report’ for 2the development, although there is a Development Control Officer’s Professional Planning Report (PPR) available to view online. 5. In relation to request 2, the Council says that the legislation used to determine the planning application was the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. 6. The Council explained that a case officer would have assessed whether a project fell within the EIA Regulations, and also set out why it was of the view that it did not do so. It confirmed that it was of the view that the grant of planning permission was lawful. 7. The Commissioner’s decision notice of 1 October 2019 concluded that the Council was correct to say that it did not hold the material referred to in requests 1 and 3, and had provided the information sought in relation to request 2. THE APPEAL 8. The Appellant’s appeal is dated 24 October 2019. He argues that the 1991 Order does not contain provisions to allow the grant of planning permission in the case he is concerned about, and says therefore that the Commissioner ‘has failed to identify as to whether the Council actually hold such a legislative instrument of common law authority’. He also does not accept that the PPR ‘could be developed without any supporting planning analysis documents’ and therefore the Commissioner has erred in determining that ‘no Local Planning analysis is held relating to and supporting the PPR’. 9. The Commissioner’s response supports the conclusions in the decision notice. In relation to request 3, the Commissioner did suggest that the Council might be joined as a party to the appeal ‘for further explanation 3as to the content of the Development Control Officer’s Professional Planning Report’. However, this has not been pursued by the Tribunal or the Appellant, and the Commissioner also declared herself satisfied that there was no further information held in relation to request 3. 10. The Appellant’s further submissions and his oral submissions at the hearing concentrate on the provision of the Council of further ‘legislative instruments or common law authority which it used in the application’ and which the Appellant believes the Council must hold. He argues that this should include procedural and practice guidance. He also argues that the Council should hold information in relation to request 1 if it had acted within the relevant regulations. DISCUSSION AND DECISION 11. Public authorities are under a general duty to disclose environmental information they hold where it is requested: regulation 5(1) EIR. By regulation 5(4) EIR, ‘where the information made available is compiled by …the public authority it shall be up to date, accurate and comparable, so far as the public authority reasonably believes’. 12. When a public authority says that it does not hold the information requested (or any further information), the Commissioner (and now this Tribunal) has to consider the searches made by the public authority and the explanations given and decide, on the balance of probabilities, whether the public authority is holding the information requested. We are concerned with recorded information that is held by the Council , and not the knowledge or understanding of an individual or individuals, for example, about the reasons behind various planning decisions. 13. We are also not concerned with information which it is said that the Council should hold, even where it is said that this is necessary to comply 4with statutory functions, if in fact the Council does not hold that information. 14. In this case the Council has explained why it does not hold the information described in request 1 (the ‘consultation document’ relevant to the assessment under the EIA regulations). The Commissioner has recorded in the decision notice the reasons why the Council says that no assessment was completed (and therefore why there is no consultation document). As explained we do not have a role in deciding whether the Council should have produced a consultation document. We have no reason to believe that the Council has prepared a consultation document and is now refusing to disclose it. On the balance of probabilities, we accept that the Council does not hold the information referred to in request 1. 15. In relation to request 2, the Appellant remains convinced that there is other statutory material which has been used to determine the planning application in this case other than the 1991 Order referred to by the Council. We have not consulted the 1991 Order, and we have not sought to investigate whether there is anything else that could be relevant in terms of Northern Ireland law in this case which the Council could or should have referred to. The Council may have limited the material it has consulted or used (we do not know), but, again, we have no reason to believe that the Council has based its decisions on other statutory material or common law authority and is now simply refusing to say what these are. The Appellant’s request did not, in our view, extend to other material such as practice guidance. 16. If the Appellant thinks that the Council has acted unlawfully by not applying the correct law to the planning issue, then there are other avenues he can use. The Appellant told us that he was familiar with making judicial review applications, and that might be one possible route (we say no more than that), and it may well be that there is a planning 5complaints or appeal process if it is thought that the Council has acted unlawfully. 17. In relation to request 3, again the Appellant is faced with the difficulty that the Council says that there is no Local Planning Analysis Report for the development, and so it cannot be disclosed to the Appellant. The Appellant has confirmed that there is a Development Control Officer’s Professional Planning Report (PPR) available to view online as stated by the Council. The PPR was not in our bundle, but the Appellant told us that he was content for us to look at it. From a brief viewing it the PPR appears to contain a fair amount of detail about the development and the surrounding circumstances. Again, we have no reason to believe that the Council has produced a Local Planning Analysis Report which it is now refusing to disclose. 18. It does not seem to us that we need to receive further information from the Council as to how the PPR is produced to decide this case. 19. The Appellant may have concerns that the Council has not dealt with the application for this development in a lawful way. However, the Appellant will not be able to advance his arguments by seeking information that that the Council does not hold. CONCLUSION 20. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that that the Council does not hold the information sought by the Appellant in relation to requests 1 and 3, and has responded appropriately to provide him with the information it holds in relation to request 2, and we dismiss the appeal. 6Stephen Cragg QC Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 4 April 2020.

"1410","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Decision notice Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0111 Heard at Field House, London On 19,20 November Before JUDGE CHRIS HUGHES TRIBUNAL MEMBERS MELANIE HOWARD & MIKE JONES Between DR PAUL THORNTON Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent HIGH SPEED 2 (HS2) Ltd Second Respondent Appearances:- Appellant: In person First Respondent: Eric Metcalfe Second Respondent: Timothy Pitt Payne QCDECISION AND REASONS 1. This is a case under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). The EIR have their origin in the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) 1998 a treaty prepared through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe which has been ratified by the UK and the European Union. The European Union adopted Directive 2003/4/EC which in Recital 5 explained the reason for the adoption of the Directive:- “(5) On 25 June 1998 the European Community signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (""the Aarhus Convention""). Provisions of Community Law must be consistent with that Convention with a view to its conclusion by the European Community.” The Explanatory Memorandum to the EIR states “4. Legislative background (i) The Regulations will implement Directive 2003/4/EC (the Directive) on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EC.” It is clear therefore that the EIR should be interpreted in a way consistent with the Aarhus Convention and the tribunal if faced with ambiguities, uncertainties, paradoxes or lacunae should have regard to the Convention and the guidance published by the United Nations “The Aarhus Convention And Implementation Guide”. 2. The Convention gives rights of access to information held by public authorities subject to specific exceptions. A public authority is defined by Article 2.2:- “2. “Public authority” means: (a) Government at national, regional and other level; (b) Natural or legal persons performing public administrative functions under national law, including specific duties, activities or services in relation to the environment; (c) Any other natural or legal persons having public responsibilities or functions, or providing public services, in relation to the environment, under the control of a body or person falling within subparagraphs (a) or (b) above;” 3. The definition of public authority in EIR is similar:- “(2) Subject to paragraph (3), “public authority” means— (a)government departments; [public authorities listed or defined in the Freedom of Information Act] (c)any other body or other person, that carries out functions of public administration; or(d)any other body or other person, that is under the control of a person falling within sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) and— (i)has public responsibilities relating to the environment; (ii)exercises functions of a public nature relating to the environment; or (iii)provides public services relating to the environment.” 4. The Implementation guide makes clear the practical challenges which led to this wide definition (page 46):- “The definition is broken into three parts to provide as broad coverage as possible. Recent developments in privatized solutions to the provision of public services have added a layer of complexity to the definition. The Convention tries to make it clear that such innovations cannot take public services or activities out of the realm of public information, participation or justice.” 5. It is clear therefore that 2(2)(c) of the Convention is in essence an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that where a government department within 2(2)(a) arranges its public services in relation to the environment so that they are discharged through an entity caught by 2(2)(c) i.e. an entity under the control of the government department; then that entity is within the scope of the Convention – the purpose of the provision is to make the precise nature of the arrangements under which a government department carries out its functions irrelevant; environmental information under the control of a government department should be subject to disclosure under the Convention. 6. HS2 Ltd is in terms of its legal status a private company limited by guarantee – no different from any other private company. As such it would not be subject to the Aarhus Convention in the same way that any other private construction company would not be subject to these provisions. However, from an examination of the actual arrangements the position is otherwise. The single member of the company is the Secretary of State for Transport, its funding is voted by Parliament and it is subject to the scrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee. The appointment of its senior staff is under the direct control of the Department of Transport and a complex governance framework provides little autonomy for HS2 with all significant decisions made by the civil servants of the Department of Transport acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport within the overall mesh of Treasury and Cabinet oversight subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. 7. This case arose out of that process of Parliamentary scrutiny. Dr Thornton, who is concerned about the impact of the HS2 project and had been monitoring its progress wrote to HS2 Ltd. on 4 April 2017:- ""I refer to the oral evidence session of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee on Monday 11 Jul 2016 in which the witnesses were Philip Rutnam, Permanent Secretary, Department for Transport, David Prout, Director General, High Speed Rail Group, Department for Transport, and Simon Kirby, Chief Executive, HS2 Ltd. The record of thissession is at this link: http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidenc... (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evid encedocument/public-accountscommittee/ high-speed-2/oral/35001.pdf) At question 55, in response to a follow up question from Sir Amyas Morse [the Comptroller and Auditor General], Mr David Prout advises that an MPA report has assessed that one of the key risks “is whether or not we are trying to do it (the HS2 project) too fast.” He continues “We have therefore invited the company to make proposals and to offer us advice on whether or not we should extend the programme by up to 12 months. We have not received that advice yet.” At question 58, Mr Simon Kirby confirms that to respond to the DfT request above, HS2 Ltd “will be producing a report in the Autumn.” Under the provisions of the Environmental Information Regulations, I would be grateful if you would provide 1. The information contained in the request submitted to HS2 Ltd described by Mr Prout, along with any accompanying or referenced documentation provided to HS2 Ltd in relation to that request. 2. The information contained in the report anticipated by Mr Kirby or any alternative equivalent response that was eventually provided. 3. The information contained in any subsequent communications between HS2 Ltd and DfT that relates to the information contained in 2. above."" 8. HS2 Ltd resisted the request relying on the provisions of FOIA s36(2) (b)(ii) and (c). On internal review it maintained the position that the request should be dealt with under FOIA but indicated that it considered that the information was exempt from disclosure under EIR 12(4)(d). Dr Thornton complained to the Information Commissioner. HS2 confirmed that under FOIA it would also rely on s36(2)(b)(i) and s43(2), and if the analysis were under EIR then also on Regulation 12(5)(e). 9. Following an investigation, the Commissioner concluded that Change Notices relating to phase One and a review relating to a Change Notice were part of HS2 and the HS2 programme was a measure affecting the environment and should be considered under EIR. She examined the arguments in favour of disclosure, noting the need for transparency and accountability about a major public project. She considered HS2’s arguments that the Main Works Contracts for phase 1 were awarded in July 2017 and the detailed design of phase 1 was still open to consideration. She recognised the argument in favour of a safe space for that consideration and that releasing information while policy was still developing risked misleading the public and that even if the information was contextualised there was still a risk of misleading people as to the extent that they would be affected and noted HS2’s argument “It is contrary to the public interest to disclose information reflecting possibilities considered before a decision has been made. Disclosure would mean HS2 would have to expend public resources on explaining and justifying information on possibilities before final decisions have even been taken.” In weighing the balance she noted the significance of transparency and the extent of public interest in HS2, its environmental impact and costs:-”27. The Commissioner notes that policy decisions relating to specific aspects within the HS2 programme are yet to be taken, in particular in this case in relation to Phase One, Stage One. The Commissioner considers that effective policy making depends on good decision making which depends not only on sound evidence but candid communications that allow a full consideration of all the options without any concern over premature disclosure. Policy decisions, such as in relation to the HS2 project need to be thoroughly evaluated before it can be properly implemented and this can only happen when all parties have the confidence that there is no risk that those exchanges will be disclosed prematurely. The impact on these processes and weight to be given to these arguments must be determined on the circumstances of each case. 28.In this case the withheld information relates to policy decisions still under consideration relating to Phase One, Stage One of the HS2 project. It has confirmed that final policy decisions have not yet been taken in this area. Furthermore, in this case the request was made prior to the awarding of the MWCC’s for Stage One in July 2017. This policy area was still therefore live at the time of request. Therefore, there is a strong public interest in maintaining the safe space for public officials to develop ideas, debate live issues and reach decisions away from external interference. 29.On balance the Commissioner considers that the public interest arguments in favour of disclosure are outweighed by the public interest arguments in favour of maintaining the exception. Regulation 12(4)(d) EIR was therefore correctly applied in this case.” 10. In his appeal Dr Thornton argued that the IC had incorrectly interpreted regulation 12(4)(d) which on a proper construction of the Aarhus Convention could not apply to actual documents which had been completed simply because they include information created as part of the process of formulation and development of policy even where that process was incomplete. Even if the exemption applied there was no indication that there was a need for a “safe space” indeed if the information was very sensitive there was a greater interest in publication in order to inform the public. 11. In resisting the appeal the IC noted that 12(4)(d) allows for refusal of disclosure where “the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data” She submitted that the Aarhus Implementation guide was consistent with her approach to interpretation and safe space arguments could apply to the consideration of changes following a period of public and parliamentary scrutiny where the project was extensive and subject to scrutiny over time. 12. In supporting the IC’s position HS2 explained that it was an executive non departmental public body formed and sponsored by the Department for Transport (DfT). It has a single member (the Secretary of State for Transport) and operates within the financial framework of the DfT. HS2 agreed with the IC that 12(4)(d) was engaged and that decisions of the tribunal supported the proposition that documents which had been completed could be part of material in the course of completion. The material had been prepared to inform DfT and enable it to determine the optimal delivery programme for HS2 which was notdecided at the time of the request, since that decision was not complete the documents fell within 12(4)(d). HS2 further argued on the basis of IC guidance that the relationship between HS2 and DfT was so close that communications between them should be seen as not between a public authority and a third party but as internal communications and the Directive was not intended to create a false segregation between different parts of the same Government accordingly the material fell within 12(4)(e). Since the decision-making was not complete there was a strong argument to allow officials to develop ideas and options away from external interference. 13. Mr Yass who has significant responsibilities within HS2 gave evidence of the structure of HS2 and its relation to the Secretary of State (SoS). It is a large complex organisation with the role of procuring a railway which will be built by contractors. It is subject to detailed control, including through a Development Agreement in accordance with which HS2 prepares Baseline Cost Models and Baseline Delivery Schedules to enable the SoS to exercise control over HS2’s work programme and costs. He explained (witness statement paragraph 30) that the Department could instruct HS2 by issuing it with a Change Notice requiring it to provide advice with respect to a potential change to the works or services set out in the Development Agreement and, having received that advice the Department could issue a Change Confirmation Notice which would incorporate the changes to the plan that HS2 was contracted to provide. Following a review by the Cabinet Secretary known as the Periodic Update potential costs savings and other changes were identified to improve the programme. HS2 did not receive a copy of the Periodic Update, however it caused the issuing of a Change Notice (CN0013) by which HS2 was asked to provide advice in relation to some of the findings of the Periodic Update. HS2 prepared and provided a scope of work document and a project execution document detailing what it would do to respond to the CN, the Response and associated documents. The DfT then issuedCN0014 directing HS2 to provide a Baseline Cost Model and baseline delivery Schedule for Phase 1 of the HS2 project. The material within scope of the request was CN0013, the response to it and CN0014. 14. On the balance of public interest with respect to 12(4)(d) Mr Yass explained that the information dealt with a potential change to the timing of the start of passenger services and disclosure would risk affecting the fullness and frankness of such advice in the future, which would contribute to poorer and less auditable decision-making, in addition wider disclosure would require further resources to be devoted to addressing public inquiries before any change to timescale was agreed, which would increase uncertainty and stress for those affected by the plans. Furthermore, contractors who might be affected by changes to the scheduling of work might seek to exploit this financially or make contractual claims against HS2. 15. With respect to 12(5)(e) he argued that disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial information. There were a number of contracts in place following extensive price negotiations on defined work packages. Thesevery large contracts had been won by a small number of consortia. If there was confusion over the construction schedule then these contracts would become more difficult and there was a potential for claims for additional costs on the basis that HS2 was delaying the work. There were numerous further procurements still to be put in place for phase 1. If any bidder could access HS2’s baseline cost model this could prejudice HS2’s ability to ensure the best financial outcome from the procurement and undermine the procurement itself, if one potential contractor had access to the information but not other possible bidders. 16. In closed session the tribunal explored with Mr Yass the impact of specific issues with respect to timing and extent of works and the potential commercial impact of disclosure. 17. In this appeal brought by Dr Thornton three exemptions under EIR Regulation 12 need to be considered 12(4)(d) and (e), and 12(5)(e). In addition, 12(3) is relevant to the names of individuals. The Regulation 12 is headed Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information and provides (so far as is relevant):- “12.—(1) … a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if— (a)an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. (3) To the extent that the information requested includes personal data of which the applicant is not the data subject, the personal data shall not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with regulation 13. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that— ….. (d)the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data; or (e)the request involves the disclosure of internal communications. (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— ……. (e)the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest;”18. The two exceptions contained in regulation 12(4) derive from Article 4 of the Convention Access to Environmental Information which provides that a request may be refused: “… 3. A request for environmental information may be refused if: ….. (c) The request concerns material in the course of completion or concerns internal communications of public authorities where such an exemption is provided for in national law or customary practice, taking into account the public interest served by disclosure.” 19. It is clear that the two exceptions in the Regulation 12 are contained within one in the Convention and is dependent on protection for “material in the course of completion or concerns internal communications of public authorities” being present in “national law or customary practice”. In the UK rules with respect to the disclosure or release of the information held by public authorities these are now contained in the Freedom of Information legislation applying to the various parts of the UK and accordingly it is appropriate, for a case relating to England and Wales, to consider FOIA 2000. The most relevant provisions in FOIA which deal with somewhat similar issues are s22 (which protects information intended for future publication which is conceptually similar to be material in the course of completion), s35 which protects information held by a government department relating to the formulation or development of government policy and s36 protecting information to avoid prejudice to the free and frank provision of advice. These provisions protect information which is the subject of internal communications within a government department. It is clear therefore that the Convention protection is an exemption within UK national law. 20. The Implementation Guide (second Edition page 85) explored the provision. It drew attention to a decision where “material in the course of completion” was given a restrictive interpretation with respect to raw data on air pollution, which should be liable to disclosure, if necessary with an explanation highlighting that the processes of correction and validation had not been carried out. It suggested that “drafts of documents such as permit, EIAs, policies, programmes, plans and executive regulations that are open for comment under the Convention [the tribunal’s emphasis] would not be materials in the course of completion”. 21. The guidance also draws attention to a 2007 case before the Conseil d’Etat (the superior French Court for Administrative Law) which concluded that a “provision excluding preliminary documents produced in the course of drawing up an administrative decision from the right of access to environmental is not compatible with article 3 paragraph 3 of Directive 90/313/EEC” (this Directive being the precursor of Directive 2003/4/EC):- “Article 3 …3. A request for information may be refused where it would involve the supply of unfinished documents or data or internal communications” However, what is not clear from the note of the case within the guidance is the nature of the “administrative decision” and the statutory framework within which it is made or the status of the preliminary documents within that administrative framework. 22. The Implementation Guide does not cite any caselaw with respect to the interpretation of the second limb of the exception “internal communications” and notes that State Parties may wish to define “internal communications”. The text implies that the State Parties have different approaches and indicates various categories of material which would not fall within the exemption and continues “Neither can studies commissioned by public authorities from related, but independent, entities”. Here the relationship of the Secretary of State and HS2 is crucial. HS2 is formally separated from the Secretary of State, however the intensity of control exercised means that HS2 is very far from being independent. 23. It is clear that the Convention and the implementing regulations need to be interpreted purposively and as a whole. The function of the Convention is to ensure that governments and other public authorities with governmental functions which hold environmental information should disclose it to the public when requested. However, HS2 is not a public authority in its fundamental nature, it is a limited company whose governing law is the Companies Act like many hundreds of thousands of other private companies. It is not of its basic constitution subject to the disclosure requirements of EIR. It is subject to disclosure because it is owned, funded and controlled in great detail by a government department. It holds environmental information because of that control and the disclosure obligation arises from that control. The purpose of the Convention is not to determine the structures of government, it is indifferent to them, the provision which brings HS2 within the scope of EIR is not intended to create greater access within one structure than another, but to ensure comparable access irrespective of structure. The implementation guide is explicit on the approach of the Aarhus Convention to questions of government structure:- “Recent developments in privatized solutions to the provision of public services have added a layer of complexity to the definition. The Convention tries to make it clear that such innovations cannot take public services or activities out of the realm of public information, participation or justice.” 24. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the provision which allows for the possibility of non-disclosure on the basis of the information being part of the internal communications of a government department should, given the neutrality of the Convention with respect to Governmental structures, apply to a wholly-owned and controlled entity such as HS2. Similarly the structure of the decision-making means that the DfT asks questions of HS2, which in turn carries out analysis and provides answers to the Department. That materialleads to decision-making within the Department which results in a decision to change the procurement activities to be carried out. These documents are therefore part of material in the course of completion. 25. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the exemption for material in the course of completion and the exemption for internal communications 12(5)(e) are both engaged. 26. In considering the balance of interest between the disclosure and the withholding of the information the Information Commissioner correctly noted that there are clear arguments in favour of transparency in respect of the information on this major project and enabling the public to understand the development of thinking about the project which in turn promotes accountability. However the tribunal would add that the value of the information which would be disclosed is, within the scheme of information available to the public about the route, the environmental impact and the economic consequences of the project very limited and as the officials were still developing ideas and debating live options uncertain as to the impact that these options might have on the environment. In these circumstances the tribunal considers there is real force in the concerns about the impact on decision making and that the public interest in non-disclosure protected by the exemption in 12(4)(d) (incomplete material) and 12(4)(e) (internal communications) outweighs any benefit in disclosure. On this occasion the need for a safe space for a limited period is clear. 27. Furthermore, the commercial impact of disclosure of the information would be very considerable. It would create the potential for claims against HS2 from contractors, would make more complicated negotiations which were underway and it could very possibly undermine aspects of the tendering process requiring a further exercise because of differential information to differing contractors. In all disclosure would create a serious risk to the public purse. The tribunal is satisfied that these considerations are weighty and far outweigh the interest in disclosure. 28. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Information Commissioner’s decision is correct in law, the appeal is without merit and is dismissed. Chris Hughes Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 14 February 2020"
"264","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2019/0053 Decided without a hearing On 11 July 2019 Before JUDGE BUCKLEY JEAN NELSON PAUL TAYLOR Between JOHN CONNOR Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the Tribunal dismisses the appeal. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50778479 of 30 January 2019 which held that Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council (‘the Council) were entitled to rely on s 14(1) of FOIA. The Commissioner held that the Council breached s 17(5) by failing to issue a refusal notice applying s 14 within 20 working days. The Commissioner did not require the public authority to take any steps. 1Evidence and submissions 2. We have read and were referred to a bundle of documents. Factual background to the appeal 3. There is a long and complex background to this appeal, which will not be set out in detail. In essence the matter arises out of planning applications made by the owners of land adjacent to Mr Connor’s property in 1973 and 1996, in which Mr Connor states false information was provided. There are related disputes about the use of the boundary wall as a form of support for the neighbour’s garage roof, and about the status of the lane to the rear of the property. Mr Connor is aggrieved that the Council refused to take action against the neighbour(s) for the false information. The Council has informed him that an applicant is only likely to be fined for knowingly or recklessly making a false or misleading statement in exceptional circumstances and that in its view Mr Connor did not suffer injustice as a result of the false declaration. Mr Connor is not satisfied with this. 4. The Council has failed to provide detailed evidence of its dealings with Mr Connor, but the bundle shows that the following correspondence/proceedings with and/or against the Council and/or others all arise from the matters set out in the preceding paragraph. Complaints to the Council 5. On 6 January 2006 the Council wrote to Mr Connor in response to a letter of complaint dated 18 November 2005. That letter stated that on 2 November 2005 the Council had written to Mr Connor’s solicitors to confirm ‘once again’ that his complaints about the Council would not be pursued. It refers to a letter from the Council to Mr Connor on 11 May 2004 covering the same issues (but in relation to the earlier planning application). 6. The Council’s defence in claim number 7NE03964, dated 1 June 2007, states that Mr Connor wrote a number of letters of complaint to the Council, including letters dated 7 April 2003, 18 November 2005 and 10 April 2007 and that he raised a formal complaint with the Council in 2006. There is also reference in that defence and/or its defence in B90NE122 to letters between the Council and Mr Connor on the same issue dated 11 June 2003, 1 September 2003, 17 December 2003, 6 January 2006, 12 March 2007 and 25 April 2013. 7. In that defence the Council also states at para 4(c) that ‘The Defendant will aver that it is a matter for itself whether or not it pursues Mr McVicar in relation to a false or misleading declaration being made, none being admitted.’ 2Complaints to the ICO 8. Mr Connor made a complaint to the Information Commissioner in 2017 (case reference FS50650467) about a previous information request he had submitted to the Council. After obtaining further information from the Council, the Commissioner decided to take further no action. Legal Proceedings 9. Mr Connor issued legal proceedings against the Council (which seem to be those to which the defence is in the bundle i.e. case number 7NE03964). These were unsuccessful and the claimant was refused permission to appeal. In 2013 Mr Connor issued an application for permission to judicial review, which was dismissed as being ‘without merit’ and the Council awarded costs. In 2014 Mr Connor issued proceedings in the Newcastle District Registry, Chancery Division (case number A30 NE049) which were withdrawn. He issued further proceedings (case number B90NE122) which were discontinued by Mr Connor in about March 2016. Complaints to the LGO 10. Mr Connor made complaints to the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) in March 2004 (03/C/18837), December 2007 (07/C/13118) and in July 2008 (07/C/13118/KEH/sw). The Council’s response to a part 8 claim by Mr Connor dated December 2015 refers to complaints to the LGO in 2003 and 2005. In 2005 the LGO informed Mr Connor’s solicitors that it would not pursue the complaints against the Council because there was no evidence of maladministration leading to injustice. The investigation in 2008 was discontinued by the LGO, partly because it had previously investigated the same issue. In its letter of 6 August 2008, the LGO stated: ‘It is for the Council to consider whether to take action against your neighbour for this and it has decided not to.’ Complaints to Northumbria Police 11. In 2005 Mr Connor made a complaint to Northumbria Police who declined to take any action. Requests, Decision Notice and appeal The Request 12. This appeal concerns the following requests, extracted from a letter dated 25 April 2018. Mr Connor accepted, by letter to the Tribunal dated 30 March 2019, that requests 1, 2 and 5 were not requests for information. We have therefore limited our consideration to requests 3, 4, 6 and 7. 31. Clarification on what was meant as set out in relation to your Part 8 Claim Form dated 22/12/2015 and the letter to the court manager dated 24 March 2016. 2. Why Gateshead Council did not inform the Ombudsman that [Council Office 1] Head of Planning should not have said “only in very exceptional circumstances”. 3. The name and position held of the Gateshead Council Employee(s) who further confirmed to the Ombudsman that [Council Officer 1], Head of Planning was correct. 4. A full disclosure of what would constitute “Very exceptional circumstances” 5. An explanation as to why Gateshead Council did not confirm that [Council Officer 1] Head of Planning should not have said “only likely to occur in very exceptional circumstances”. 6. [Council Officer 2} should have asked any advisors or employees supplying him with the information to be included in a verified document to confirm in writing that the information was correct before he signed his statement of truth to the County Court, I request a copy of that document. 7. A copy of the letter from [the neighbour] to Gateshead Council requesting information that the boundary wall was in not way supporting the peaked roof. The Council’s reply 13. The Council replied by email dated 17 May 2018 stating that no recorded or no information was held. Mr Connor replied to this email on 12 June 2018 and in its response to that email on 19 June 2018 the Council stated: We are treating this request as vexatious. We have previously responded to you and you have complained to the Information Commissioner who agreed with our position. No further requests for information on this topic will be responded to. 14. Mr Connor applied for an internal review on 23 July 2018. He received no reply and referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 18 August 2018. The Council does not appear to have conducted any substantive internal review, but emailed Mr Connor on 4 September 2018 repeating its response given on 19 June. The Decision Notice 15. In a decision notice dated 30 January 2019 the Commissioner decided that the Council had correctly applied s 14(1) FOIA (vexatious request). 16. The Commissioner concluded that the request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure. She concluded that the substantive matters at the heart of the grievance have been investigated by the Council, the LGO and the Courts, none of which have found that Mr Connor has suffered an injustice. She concluded that the request is an attempt to re- litigate or re-open matters that have already been addressed and is a misuse of the FOIA process. The Commissioner was critical of the Council’s failure to engage with the Commissioner’s office in respect of this complaint. 4Notice of Appeal 17. Mr Connor appealed against the Commissioner’s decision notice. His grounds of appeal set out the historical background to his complaint, but do not clearly identify any error of law. In essence, Mr Connor submits that his request was not vexatious and that it is in the public interest that the information is provided. 18. The Tribunal notes that Mr Connor also asserts that the Council do hold the information. This is not an issue before the Tribunal in this appeal. The ICO’s response 19. The Commissioner submits that Mr Connor has not demonstrated why the Decision Notice is wrong in law. The background information provided by Mr Connor supports the conclusion that the request was vexatious. Issues 20. The issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether or not the request is vexatious. Legal framework S 14(1) Vexatious Request 21. Guidance on applying s 14 is given in the decisions of the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in Dransfield ([2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and [2015] EWCA Civ 454). The tribunal has adapted the following summary of the principles in Dransfield from the judgment of the Upper Tribunal in CP v Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 427 (AAC): 22. The Upper Tribunal held that the purpose of section 14 must be to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA (para 10). That formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal subject to the qualification that this was an aim which could only be realised if ‘the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied’ (para 72 of the CA judgment). 23. The test under section 14 is whether the request is vexatious not whether the requester is vexatious (para 19). The term ‘vexatious’ in section 14 should carry its ordinary, natural meaning within the particular statutory context of FOIA (para 24). As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may be vexatious but that is not a rule. Annoying or irritating requests are not necessarily vexatious given that one of the main purposes of FOIA is to provide citizens with a qualified right of access to official documentation and thereby a means of holding public authorities to account (para 25). The IC’s guidance that the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause was a useful 5starting point as long as the emphasis was on the issue of justification (or not). An important part of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of whether or not there is an adequate or proper justification for the request (para 26). 24. Four broad issues or themes were identified by the Upper Tribunal as of relevance when deciding whether a request is vexatious. These were: (a) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (b) the motive (of the requester); (c) the value or serious purpose (of the request); and (d) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). These considerations are not exhaustive and are not intended to create a formulaic check-list. 25. Guidance about the motive of the requester, the value or purpose of the request and harassment of or distress to staff is set out in paragraphs 34-39 of the Upper Tribunal’s decision. 26. As to burden, the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether the request is properly to be described as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor [para 29]. Thus, the greater the number of previous FOIA requests that the individual has made to the public authority concerned, the more likely it may be that a further request may properly be found to be vexatious. A requester who consistently submits multiple FOIA requests or associated correspondence within days of each other or who relentlessly bombards the public authority with email traffic is more likely to be found to have made a vexatious request [para 32]. 27. Ultimately the question was whether a request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Answering that question required a broad, holistic approach which emphasised the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there was a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests [paras 43 and 45]. 28. In the Court of Appeal in Dransfield Arden LJ gave some additional guidance in paragraph 68: ‘In my judgment the Upper Tribunal was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient 6degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the request was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available...’ 29. Nothing in the above paragraph is inconsistent with the Upper Tribunal’s decision which similarly emphasised (a) the need to ensure a holistic approach was taken and (b) that the value of the request was an important but not the only factor. 30. The lack of a reasonable foundation to a request was only the starting point to an analysis which must consider all the relevant circumstances. Public interest cannot act as a ‘trump card’. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious. The role of the tribunal 31. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether he should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Discussion and conclusions 32. The information provided by the Council and the level of its engagement with the ICO has been limited. The Council stated in its letter to the ICO dated 8 October 2018 that: Mr Connor has has a long history of litigation and complaints to the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) regarding this matter. He also made a previous complaint to your office reference FS50650467. The Council does not hold the information he has requested. He has been repeatedly advised of that in correspondence which has been ongoing since 1996. He brought proceedings against the Council which were struck out and he was ordered to pay our costs, He has made two complaints to the LGO and this is the second complaint to your office. There is no merit to his requests, he just repeats the same requests every so often. We have and will continue to treat him as vexatious on any requests he makes pertaining to the planning issues which have been subject to litigation. 33. By email to the ICO dated 21 January 2019 the Council added: 7Our response to the part 8 claim essentially sets out the historic position. This is a matter which has been going on since the 1980’s. Mr Connor believes we should have prosecuted a neighbour. He has asked on a number of occasions and has been told why that will happen. He has made complaints to the Ombudsman and complaints to your office essentially all about the same matter. We have provided him with access to information which we hold in recorded form. Some of the information we do not hold and he is also seeking interpretation of the Town and Country Planning Act, which we are not obliged to do. 34. We echo the observations of the Commissioner in the Decision Notice on the paucity of information and evidence provided by the Council. The Council is likely to be assisted in future cases by making reference to the section entitled ‘What the ICO expect from a local authority’ in the ICO Guidance on dealing with vexatious requests and by directing its submissions towards the guidance in Dransfield. 35. The Tribunal considers the four factors identified by the Upper Tribunal to be a helpful framework to structure its consideration of whether the request was vexatious but has had regard to the fact that it is not intended to be an exhaustive definition or a checklist for determination of this issue and that a holistic approach must be taken, with no one factor acting as a trump card. 36. In the absence of any detailed submissions or significant evidence from the Council, we have proceeded on the basis of the information before us. 37. The Council in its email dated 8 January 2019, cited above, appears to suggest that the Council may be treating Mr Connor as a vexatious requestor. This is the wrong approach. It is the request that must be vexatious and not the requestor, and that is the approach we adopt. 38. The Council has provided no evidence of any distress or harassment. In terms of burden, the Council’s evidence is insufficiently detailed for us to make a finding that a significant burden is imposed by the request. 39. We find that the request has little value and serves no real purpose. It relates purely to Mr Connor’s private dispute. We disagree that there is any significant objective public interest in the information requests. Mr Connor has complained about the same issue to the Council a significant number of times over a significant period of time. The Council has already informed Mr Connor on numerous occasions of its decision not to take action and of the reason why no action was taken. Mr Connor has pursued numerous legal actions and complaints to LGO about the same issue. The underlying grievance has been exhaustively considered and addressed. We cannot see how obtaining an answer to this request will contribute in any way to resolving the issue. There are other more appropriate forums for resolving Mr Connor’s issues, most, if not all, of which Mr Connor has already used. This is an attempt to find an alternative way to re-litigate an issue which Mr Connor has attempted to re- litigate on numerous occasions through various alternative avenues over a long 8period of time. We find that there is no adequate or proper justification for the request. Conclusion 40. We have taken a holistic and broad approach and have looked at the entire course of dealings. We have considered the history of numerous complaints to different parties and the litigation on this issue, and we have considered the value and purpose of this request. Looking at all these factors we find that the request was vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of the FOIA. 41. For completeness, and because the request relates to planning issues, we determined that we would have reached the same conclusion if we had considered the case under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004/3391 (EIR). Applying the three stage test under regulation 12(4)(b) we would have concluded, taking account of all the factors and matters set out above, that the request was manifestly unreasonable, that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information in all the circumstances and that the presumption in favour of disclosure did not mean that the information should be disclosed. Whilst the different test under the EIR may lead to a different outcome in some cases, we concluded that on the facts it would not have done.

"28","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0219 Decided without a hearing On 9 May 2019 Before JUDGE ANTHONY SNELSON MR PIETER DE WAAL MR ANDREW WHETNALL Between MR GAVIN RATTRAY Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent and WEST LANCASHIRE BOROUGH COUNCIL Second Respondent DECISION The unanimous decision of the Tribunal is that: (1) The appeal is allowed. (2) The First Respondent’s decision that the Second Respondent correctly applied the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, reg 12(4)(b) is set aside and the Tribunal substitutes its own decision that reg 12(4)(b) was not correctly applied and the Second Respondent was not entitled to rely on that provision as entitling it to refuse the Appellant’s request for information dated 27 October 2017. 1REASONS Introduction and procedural history 1. The Appellant, Mr Gavin Rattray, to whom we will refer by name, lives in Burscough, West Lancashire. The area is prone to drainage problems and he has, since 2012 if not earlier, played an active part in pressing responsible bodies for action to protect local people from flooding and associated damage. 2. There is no doubt that the concerns raised by Mr Rattray are serious. He describes without challenge (supported by photographic and other evidence) consequences of heavy rainfall which frequently include blockage of highways and rights of way by standing water and the overflow into roads and gardens of raw sewage. 3. The concerns raised by Mr Rattray are also complex. Physically, they involve the interplay of surface watercourses, groundwater sources and the sewer networks. Legally and administratively, they involve an intricate structure of related and sometimes interlocking responsibilities attached to a number of bodies. The key legislation is the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 which creates, and attaches duties to, Risk Management Authorities (‘RMAs’). 4. The Second Respondent (hereafter ‘the Council’) is the local planning authority for the area in which Burscough lies and, as such, one of the RMAs responsible for managing flood risk locally. 5. Other RMAs with relevant responsibilities are Lancashire County Council (‘LCC’) and United Utilities (‘UU’), the private utilities company which holds the contract for the supply of water and waste water services for the area. 6. On 27 October 2017, through his MP, Ms Rosie Cooper, Mr Rattray wrote to West Lancashire Borough Council requesting information connected with a planning decision relating to a local property. His request was for: 1. Copies of all legal and non-agreements (sic) and accommodations between WLBC and United Utilities made since 2005 concerning the local plans/local development frameworks. This would include the ‘partnership text’ referenced in section 4.17 of [the Council’s] Infrastructure Delivery Plan Update 2016/17 (Part 1). 2. Copies of all communications, notes taken, meeting agendas and minutes meetings between UU and WLBC since January 2013 concerning flooding in Burscough and the local plans/local development frameworks (please don’t supply anything already supplied in 1 above). 23. Copies of all communications, notes taken, meeting agendas and minutes meetings between WLBC and the environment agency concerning surface water flooding (including sewers) and water management in Burscough and its outlying areas of New Lane, Crabtree Lane and Martin Mere. This would include ‘information from the environment agency‘for [the Council’s] Delivery Plan Update 2016/17 (Part 1) and referenced in section 4.17 of it. 7. The Council, through Mr John Harrison, Director of Development and Regeneration, responded in a letter of 7 December 2017, addressed to Ms Cooper. He referred to a “protracted correspondence” between Mr Rattray and Council officers over a number of years regarding drainage matters and to Mr Rattray having issued requests for information under the freedom of information legislation and complaints under the Council’s formal complaints procedure. He continued: Such voluminous amounts of correspondence have caused a disproportionate level of disruption to the Council which is not a good use of the Council’s limited resources and which has distracted officers from the day-to-day running of council business. It is the Council’s view that Mr Rattray’s actions have been an improper use of the formal procedures for which the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 were intended. S14(1) of the FOIA1 is designed to protect public authorities by allowing them to refuse any requests which cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress. Mr Rattray in his correspondence has been unreasonably persistent on matters which the Council feels it has already comprehensively addressed. He appears to have taken an unreasonably entrenched position and has submitted frequent correspondence about the same or overlapping issues. It is the Council’s view that Mr Rattray’s requests for information, be that directly with the Council or indirectly, regarding drainage matters in and around Burscough are vexatious and therefore the information is exempt from disclosure under section 14(1) of the Act. 8. M Rattray was dissatisfied. Following a review, Mr Terry Broderick, Borough Solicitor, advised him on 30 January 2018 that the information requested fell within the scope of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘EIR’) (rather than FOIA) but that the request was “vexatious or ‘manifestly unreasonable’” and the exception from the duty to disclose under EIR, reg 12(4)(b) applied. Accordingly, relying on that provision, the Council maintained its refusal. 9. By a letter of 2 January 2018 Mr Rattray complained to the First Respondent (‘the Commissioner’) about the way in which the Council had dealt with his request. 10. The Commissioner proceeded to carry out an investigation, considering the written representations and supporting documents submitted by Mr Rattray and the Council. 1 The 2000 Act. We will adopt the same abbreviation below. 311. By a decision notice dated 19 September 2018 the Commissioner determined that the Council had correctly applied EIR reg 12(4)(b) and that the public interest favoured maintaining the exception. 12. By a notice of appeal dated 9 October 2018, Mr Rattray contended that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong. He made numerous points in support of his central contention that his request of 27 October 2017, and his prior requests for information and other communications with the Council on the subject of flooding risk, had been reasonable and made in the public interest. He further asserted that he had resorted to the freedom of information legislation because of a culture of secrecy in the Council (and other statutory bodies) designed to understate the seriousness of the flooding problem locally and avoid taking necessary remedial action. 13. By her response dated 7 November 2018 the Commissioner resisted the appeal contending that her decision of 19 September 2018 was correct. In the same document, she noted that it was apparent from the contributions of Mr Rattray and the Council that they disagreed on matters of fact and that in the circumstances it might be necessary to add the Council as a party to the proceedings. 14. The Council was duly joined as Second Respondent. 15. The Council’s response to the appeal, dated 4 January 2019, defended its reliance on reg 12(4)(b), and developed the arguments already made in response to Mr Rattray’s request. It repeated the broad complaint of frequent and overlapping requests and of “unreasonable persistence” on his part. It also charged him with using an “accusatory” tone. The applicable law 16. EIR, reg 5(1) requires a public authority holding ‘environmental information’ to make it available on request. 17. ‘Environmental information’ is defined broadly in reg 2(1) as: … information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on – (a) the state of the elements of the environment … (b) factors … affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment … (c) measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans … 18. Reg 12 sets out exceptions to the reg 5(1) duty. It includes: (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) … a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if - 4(a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) …; and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. ... (4) For the purposes of … a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that – … (b) the request for information is manifestly unreasonable … 19. In our view the effect of these provisions is clear. Reg 12(1)(b) places the burden firmly on the public authority relying on an exception to show two things: first, that the exception (here, that under sub-para (4)(b)) applies, and second, if (but only if) it does, that the public interest favours maintaining it. That the onus is on the public authority is evident from the wording of the legislation and confirmed by the authorities. The point is further reinforced by sub-para (2), which operates at both stages of the analysis. 20. We note with some consternation that our understanding of the statutory framework seems incompatible with the Commissioner’s written case. As we have recorded, she contends that the appeal should be dismissed on the footing that the public interest favours maintaining the exception. On our reading of reg 12, the public interest test does not arise at all unless and until the public authority shows that the exception is applicable. This divergence has caused us anxiously to examine our thinking afresh. Having done so, and with diffidence, we stand by it. We regret that we were not able to explore these matters with the parties face-to-face. The disadvantages of deciding disputes like this without an oral hearing have been commented upon at a higher level (we will come back to this later). 21. Not surprisingly, the Regulations do not offer a definition of ‘manifestly unreasonable’. Our duty is to give those familiar words their natural meaning, guided by authority binding upon us. 22. Given the fact that the parties agree that EIR is the applicable regime, it might seem strange that representations by the Respondents have been modelled largely on FOIA and case-law thereunder. This is, however, appropriate. By the Act, s14(1), a public authority is excused from complying with a request for information if the request is “vexatious”. In Craven v Information Commissioner and Department for Energy and Climate Change [2012] UKUT 442 (ACC) the Upper Tribunal (‘UT’) (Judge Nicholas Wikeley) held that the tests under s14(1) and reg 12(4)(b) are to all intents and purposes the same. On appeal, the Court of Appeal (reported at [2015] 1 WLR 5316) agreed. Giving the lead judgment, Arden LJ remarked that any difference was “vanishingly small” (para 78). 523. With Craven the UT considered two other appeals, Dransfield v Information Commissioner and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and Ainslie v Information Commissioner and Dorset County Council [2012] UKUT 441 (AAC), and gave judgment in all three on the same day. In Dransfield, a case under FOIA, s14(1), Judge Wikeley, at para 27, expressed agreement with an earlier first-instance decision that – “… vexatious”, connotes “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure.” The judge continued (para 28): Such misuse of the FOIA procedure may be evidenced in a number of different ways. It may be helpful to consider the question of whether a request is truly vexatious by considering four broad issues or themes – (1) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (2) the motive (of the requester); (3) the value or serious purpose (of the request) and (4) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). However, these four considerations … are not intended to be exhaustive, nor are they meant to create an alternative formulaic check-list. 24. Dransfield and Craven were heard together in the Court of Appeal. Arden LJ noted (para 60) that the UT’s guidance just cited was not directly in issue on the appeal, but added these remarks (para 68): In my judgment, the UT was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and this is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. 2 The decision-maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. In another significant passage, Arden LJ remarked (para 72): Before I leave this appeal, I note that the UT held that the purpose of section 14 was “to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA” … For my own part, I would wish to qualify that aim as one only to be realised if the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied. 25. The Council relied heavily on the Guidance published by the Commissioner. The UT passed certain comments on the Guidance relating to vexatious requests which, we understand, led to parts of it being modified. On appeal, Arden LJ commented (para 32): 2 This echoes remarks in paras 2 and 3 about the importance and constitutional significance of the right to freedom of information. 6The IC has a statutory obligation … to issue guidance … The guidance covers such matters as dealing with vexatious requests. Various government departments have also issued guidance … As this guidance does not have special status in matters of interpretation, it is not necessary for me to cite it in my conclusions. For my own part, while I welcome the issue of such advice, I do not find it provided assistance in resolving the issues on these appeals. We likewise note the Guidance but our interpretation of the law is founded on the statutory language and relevant decisions of the higher courts. 26. The appeal is brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, s57. The Tribunal’s powers in determining the appeal are delineated in s58 as follows: (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal consider – (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law; or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. The Council’s case 27. In its letter to Ms Cooper of 7 December 2017, the Council stated that Mr Rattray had been involved in a “protracted exchange of correspondence” with its officers over a number of years and that the “voluminous amounts of correspondence” had caused “a disproportionate level of disruption to the Council”. His actions were characterised as “an improper use of the formal procedures” for which the freedom of information legislation was intended. It was said that he had taken “an unreasonably entrenched position” and had submitted “frequent correspondence about the same or overlapping issues”. 28. By a letter of 27 June 2018 responding to the Commissioner’s questions, the Council supplied further detail in support of its case. It traced Mr Rattray’s pursuit of concerns back to January 2012. It claimed that its position was vindicated by a Planning Inspector, who had found that the Local Plan was “sound” and dealt appropriately with flooding and drainage matters, but that Mr Rattray had refused to accept that finding and had persisted in raising the same or similar points. In particular it cited limbs (1) and (3) of the request of 27 October 2017 as “directly related to similar requests already dealt with”, but did not identify those requests. It referred to Mr Rattray’s activity in his personal capacity and as secretary of the Burscough Flooding Group (‘BFG’), noting that other members of that body had written to the Council seeking 7“very similar information” and observed, “the collective, repeated enquiries of a similar nature from the BFG [was] a key part of the context to the Council considering the request vexatious”. Wrongly (as it now admits), it identified ‘Mr C’ as a member of the BFG and prayed in aid the fact that he had submitted 10 freedom of information requests between March and December 2017, which resulted in 41 exchanges of correspondence involving four officers of the Council. Reliance was also placed on the fact that Mr Rattray had sent communications outside the scope of the freedom of information legislation and had invoked the Council’s complaints procedure as well as pursuing a complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman. 29. Turning to the effect of this activity, the letter of 27 June 2018 complained that a great deal of time been spent responding to “multiple and overlapping requests”, which had placed “a huge strain on time and resources”. It was said that the requests were the work of “a number of requestors acting in concert as part of their campaign” and that the disruption caused was out of proportion to “any wider valuable public interest in making the requested information publicly available”. In the circumstances, the Council contended that it was justified in refusing the request. In doing so, it acknowledged the need for a balancing exercise between “the serious purpose and value of the requests, the requestor’s aims and motivation and the wider public interest against the detrimental effect on the authority”. It added that its position would, “of course”, be kept under review. 30. In a further letter to the Commissioner, dated 30 July 2018, the Council set out in table form some information concerning the 10 information requests submitted by Mr C and the five by Mr Rattray, but (although it is clear that all requests related to flooding and drainage aspects) the detail is too sparse to enable one to assess the extent if any to which requests were duplicated or overlapped. In support of the assertion of a concerted campaign, the Council drew attention to the fact that Mr Rattray had copied certain correspondence to Mr C. The Council’s letter made it clear that its reliance on the ‘vexatiousness’ defence was confined to part of Mr C’s last request and Mr Rattray’s last request. 31. The Council’s response to the appeal, dated 4 January 2019, develops the points made in the earlier documents already reviewed. It acknowledges that the prior assertion that Mr C was a member of the BFG was wrong but insists that his activities are nonetheless relevant to the defence of Mr Rattray’s claim. It complains of the length and detail of Mr C’s correspondence, citing in particular a 79-page document prepared by him in support of Mr Rattray. It passes similar comment on Mr Rattray’s response to the Local Plan Review Preferred Options Public Consultation, attached as part of his written case. 32. In the response, paras 21-26, the Council is also critical of the “accusatory tone and manner” in which, it is said, Mr Rattray’s case has been pursued (a charge 8also levelled at Mr C). Reference is made to emails sent in November and December 2018 (ie well over a year after the request under consideration) in which he referred to the Council making “bogus claims”, offering a “dubious fictional account” and, making allegations of vexatiousness and malicious time-wasting “as a convenient tactic to discourage interested residents.” The Council also quotes an article written by Mr Rattray and an email sent by him to a representative of a local newspaper, The Champion, both of which, again, appear to post-date the November 2017 request by a considerable period, which express anger and frustration at the perceived failure of the Council to deal with flooding problems locally. The Council draws attention to his remarks such as, “… as you’d expect battling to get Burscough’s flooding acknowledged by WLBC is going badly as normal.” The Council also places reliance on an anonymous social media post dated 4 October 2018 by the West Lancashire Record entitled, “If At First You Don’t Succeed, Become Vexatious”. It is evident that the piece was composed by someone with knowledge of the request of 27 October 2017 and the subsequent response of the Council and adjudication of the Commissioner. It is deeply critical of the Council’s perceived failure to deal with the flooding problems in Burscough and its response to the request. It ends by ironically congratulating “the complainant” for the successful outcome conveyed in the Commissioner’s subsidiary finding that the Council was in breach of the freedom of information legislation by failing to respond within the statutory 20 working days period, adding, “you’ve proved that those bureaucrats ARE accountable!” Despite its title, however, the post does not advocate the presentation of further requests for information, vexatious or otherwise. If anything, its general tenor is that no good would come of doing so. 33. At para 38 of the response, the Council says this: Whilst the Council understands the Appellant’s concerns regarding flooding in Burscough, it considers that Mr Rattray has exhausted the use of FOI/EIR and that other more appropriate routes should be used to feed in his concerns and those of residents about flooding issues namely through the planning application process and local plan consultation. The Commissioner’s case 34. The Commissioner explicitly acknowledges a clear public interest in favour of the disclosure of the requested information but concludes that it is outweighed by the public interest in favour of upholding the reg 12(4)(b) exception, on the basis that the burden of complying with the request would be disproportionate when compared with the benefit to the public of doing so. The Commissioner largely adopts the Council’s narrative of events, although very properly acknowledging that she is not in a position to resolve factual conflicts to which Mr Rattray has drawn attention. 9Mr Rattray’s case 35. Mr Rattray agrees that he has been an active and vociferous campaigner on planning and, in particular, flooding issues over an extended period. At some point before 2012 he joined the Burscough Action Group (BAG), a large body of local residents opposed to plans for local development and took on the informal role of ‘researcher’. He was involved in the preparation and submission of freedom of information requests on behalf of BAG directed to the Council, LCC and the EA. He also used the Council’s formal complaints procedure to complain about the behaviour of a particular councillor at a meeting with residents and pursued an appeal against the Council’s decision to take no action against him. 36. BAG was closely involved in local debate concerning the West Lancashire 2012 Local Plan. Mr Rattray submitted to the Planning Inspector documents obtained through freedom of information requests. Contrary to the Council’s case, he maintains that the Inspector imposed conditions in respect of two developments the effect of which was to prohibit any net increase in the burden on the surface water and sewer systems resulting from those developments. Moreover, in the course of public examination of the Plan, UU gave assurances about the longer term, promising to apply in 2015 for funding for the expansion and improvement of the sewer network. 37. BAG was disbanded as soon as the Local Plan was approved and Mr Rattray had very few dealings with the Council over the next three years or so, hoping that the favourable events of 2012 would lead to an end to the flooding and drainage problems. These hopes were disappointed. UU did not secure the anticipated funding and the sewer network was not improved. Frequent episodes of flooding, now exacerbated by the recent construction activity, continued. 38. In 2016 Mr Rattray was one of a handful of individuals who formed the Burscough Flooding Group (‘BFG’). The body, which has five members, describes itself as a non-political volunteer flood action group. It was established at the behest of the Burscough Parish Council (‘BPC’). It has a proper constitution and is a member of the National Flooding Forum. Mr Rattray was and is its secretary. 39. BFG has been an energetic and articulate advocate for local people concerned about drainage and planning matters in the area. It often provides advice to residents and makes representations to relevant bodies on their behalf. At the invitation of BPC, it prepares submissions on planning applications. It pursued formal complaints to the Council in respect of two particular developments and, when both were rejected, took the matter, at the Council’s suggestion, to the Local Government Ombudsman (‘LGO’). That proved a fruitless exercise 10because, as BFG discovered in due course, LGO can only entertain cases brought by persons directly affected by the matter complained of. 40. BFG has been instrumental in achieving successful outcomes for local residents on occasions. One such, in or about 2016, was to secure the agreement of the developer of the Booths site at Ringtail Retail Park to abandon plans for a proposed connection of a surface water overflow to the Lordsgate Lane sewers, which was judged likely to create a significant additional flooding risk. 41. Another notable piece of work carried out by BFG was the publication in May 2017 of the Burscough Flood Records Report, prepared at the request of the BPC. It documents incidents of flooding between 2008 and 2017 and includes maps, photographs and an exceedingly detailed commentary. The executive summary states: The [Burscough Flooding] Group has found that the causes of flooding were predominantly water discharging from United Utilities surface water and foul sewers in the urban areas; and inadequate capacity of ordinary watercourses, fed with urban surface water run-off, in the downstream rural areas. The report, and the work of BFG generally, have been strongly commended by BPC. In 2018 LCC requested that the report, and further contributions from the BFG be included in a government-funded study of Burscough’s drainage problems. 42. The freedom of information request which gives rise to this appeal was the fifth addressed by Mr Rattray to the Council. The first four spanned a period from 28 February to 22 May 2017 and all concerned flooding and drainage issues in the Burscough area. The Council responded to all of them. The Respondents contend that the requests overlapped to a certain extent and although the material before us does not enable us to verify that assertion we think, given the narrowness of the subject-matter, that it is more likely than not that there was a degree of overlap. Mr Rattray does not appear to say otherwise. He does, however, deny repeating requests for information. He says that the only exception occurred in 2017 when he re-issued a request concerning UU which had been refused some time before on, he says, what he came to realise was an unsustainable ground, namely commercial confidentiality. 43. Mr Rattray accepts that his requests were (at least in some instances) “voluminous”, but stresses that they were necessarily so given the complexity of the subject matter. 44. The purpose of the freedom of information requests is explained by Mr Rattray in these words: 11BFG’s aim, in using FOI legislation, is to reveal information which would otherwise be hidden from the public, so that real change can be implemented to the benefit of the community. He maintains that, without the information secured through freedom of information requests, it would have been impossible to secure the changes to the local plan in 2012, to produce the BFG report in 2017 and to protect local residents in other ways, such as through the amendment to the plan affecting the Lordsgate Lane sewers. 45. Contrary to the Council’s case, Mr Rattray states that he, and BFG as a whole, have been and remain willing to attend meetings with the Council and that it is the Council which has refused to engage. He says that the Council also ignores his correspondence. Generally, he complains that the Council’s stance has consistently been obstructive and characterised by an inappropriate preoccupation with secrecy. In that regard he cites a freedom of information request by BAG, again presented through the local MP, which took the Council 12 months to answer and, when it was answered, was accompanied by a request that the information be not released to BAG. 46. As the Respondents now accept, Mr C is not, and has never been, a member of BFG. He is a local resident and shares many of the concerns and aims pursued by BFG (and others) relating to drainage and flooding problems. Mr Rattray agrees that he has on occasions exchanged information and correspondence with him. 47. Mr Rattray denies the general charge of adopting an “accusatory tone”, but does not dispute using robust language on occasions. He explains that the reference to “bogus claims” and a “dubious fictional account” responded to the untrue assertions of the Council about Mr C being a member of BAG and BFG and submitting freedom of information requests on behalf of BFG. He denies that the West Lancashire Record post was written by him or any other member of BFG. As for the email to The Champion, he protests that his message was intended to be private and not for public dissemination, but he stands by what he said and defends his (and BFG’s) right to inform the public on flooding issues and put pressure on public authorities to bring about change. Analysis and conclusions 48. Rightly, the parties agree that EIR is the applicable regime. 49. We preface our conclusions by observing that the agreement for the case to be decided on the papers may have operated to the disadvantage of the Council, on whom the onus rests to justify its reliance on reg 12(4)(b). Had we heard evidence from Mr Rattray and seen him tested in cross-examination, we might (or might not) have been persuaded to take a less indulgent view of his motivation in making the request of 27 October 2017 and/or in some at least of 12his prior agitation. Likewise, we might (or might not) have been more impressed by the Council’s protestations concerning the burden of the request and its predecessors, the pressure on resources generally and related points, had we heard from a witness on those matters and seen his or her evidence tested.3 50. Even with common ground that the matter was to proceed as a ‘paper hearing’, the Respondents could have presented evidence in written form, signed and dated, from an officer of the Council suitably qualified by experience and qualifications, adding hard facts to the general assertions contained in their formal documents. Evidence might, for example, have addressed such topics as (a) the amount of time spent on prior requests (and why); (b) the amount of time likely to be required to comply with the current request (and why); and (c) the extent to which dedication of resources to dealing with Mr Rattray’s requests has prejudiced, or would be likely to prejudice, the Council’s capacity to discharge its numerous other duties (and why). 51. We make these observations because they are important. We fully understand that the right to disclosure of information is not untrammelled and we are mindful of the fact that local authorities bear an unforgiving load of statutory duties which they are expected to discharge with diminishing resources. The Council is entitled to a sympathetic hearing. But cases are made out on evidence, not mere assertion. The Council’s case before us consists very largely of assertion. 52. There is one further prefatory observation which must be made. The papers before us disclose some points of fact on which Mr Rattray and the Council disagree. These include matters such as the nature and effect of the Planning Inspector’s adjudication in 2012 and the dispute as to which ‘side’ is responsible for the sad fact (apparently agreed) that meetings do not take place between them. Without evidence we are in no position to resolve such conflicts and we have not attempted to do so. 53. The Commissioner asks us to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. As already explained, we think that this ignores the prior question whether the exception is shown to be applicable. We answer that question in the negative. We have seven main reasons for our conclusion. These correspond to a large extent with the points identified in the guidance provided in Dransfield at Court of Appeal and UT level, but we have been careful not to apply it mechanically or to treat it as a substitute for the statutory language. We are mindful of the need to consider all the circumstances and to adopt a rounded and holistic approach. 3 The potential disadvantages of ‘paper’ hearings were commented upon by the UT in Craven (para 73). 1354. The first reason is that it is not shown that the request has no reasonable foundation (see the judgment of Arden LJ in Dransfield, para 68, cited above). Rightly, the Respondents made no such suggestion. 55. Second, it is not shown that the request under consideration, seen in isolation or in the wider context of prior requests, had a malign or improper purpose or motivation. On the material presented to us we find it quite impossible to say that Mr Rattray is or has ever been actuated by any improper motive. It is plain that the concerns which he has been raising over many years are serious and that the flooding and draining problems locally continued to be unresolved at the time of his most recent request. It is also plain that he genuinely believes that the Council has consistently neglected its risk management obligations. Moreover, he is clearly right to point out that, given the subject-matter, it is in the nature of things that circumstances change, new problems develop, new information is generated and new questions arise which can legitimately be directed to responsible bodies. Here, it is demonstrated that episodes of flooding have continued to occur and local developments over the years have put added pressure on water management systems generally. In such a case, the Council’s objection that Mr Rattray is unduly persistent is not persuasive. The Tribunal would look much more critically at a request directed to an historical event which had already been fully explored (through information requests and otherwise), but in this case, we are concerned with something quite different, namely a long-standing but developing controversy. Lastly on the question of motivation, we think it significant that Mr Rattray had very few dealings with the Council for about three years from 2012 to 2015, hopeful that the successes (as he saw them) of 2012 would pave the way for a resolution of the problems. This argues against the suggestion of an obsessive or malicious mind-set on his part. 56. Third, it is not shown that the request was excessive in scope. The Council’s own case appeared to acknowledge that the specific request, in itself, could not be characterised as excessive and that it was the wider historical context which made it so. That is plainly right. Having examined the evidence carefully, we are not persuaded that the requests for information presented by Mr Rattray, viewed collectively, have been excessive. We accept that some requests have overlapped to a degree, but the Council’s case on this aspect (as generally) lacks sufficient clarity to enable a proper assessment to be made. Moreover, it is in the nature of things, given the subject-matter of the requests, that a degree of overlap will be hard to avoid and we remind ourselves that the freedom of information provisions are intended to be available to all (see generally Craven, UT, para 96) and must not be treated as demanding the drafting skills of the High Court practitioner. Moreover, to the extent that any request overlaps with a prior request there is little or no prejudice to the Council: it can refer to a previous answer rather than producing the information afresh. The evidence presented does not substantiate the Council’s vague assertion that Mr Rattray has repeated requests for information, other than on the single occasion which 14he has admitted and explained. We accept that it is legitimate in principle for a public authority to have regard to requests for information made by persons other than the requester. We also accept that the Council’s case on this aspect is not defeated by the simple fact that Mr C is not and has never been a member of BFG. But its problem is that, for want of specifics and detail, and for the other reasons already given in respect of overlap with Mr Rattray’s prior claims, the complaint of a cumulatively excessive set of requests is not sustained. We bear in mind here that the Council answered Mr Rattray’s first four requests and Mr C’s first nine without objection. 57. Fourth, it is not shown that the effect of the request would be to impose an excessive or disproportionate burden upon the Council. As already stated, in relation to the request viewed in isolation, that proposition is more or less conceded. Having regard to the context, and specifically the history of prior requests, we are satisfied that the same conclusion applies. We have already commented on the sparseness of the Council’s case and in particular the absence of hard facts and evidence. We are not provided with any detail as to, for example, the number of hours of staff time which would need to be devoted to answering the current request, the hours spent on prior requests, the impact on other services, and so on. A case based on assertion and hand- wringing alone will not prevail. 58. Fifth, we are troubled by the logic of the Council’s case, which it does not shrink from expressing in plain language, that the door must now be closed on any further request for information related to flooding risk in and around Burscough. That logic runs counter to the entire spirit of the freedom of information legislation. It seeks to deprive Mr Rattray and, by extension, other concerned individuals who might be seen as associated with him, apparently for ever, of an important constitutional right to seek information in order to hold a public body to account on a matter of obvious public significance. In addition, it ignores the point already made (see our second ground above) that the subject-matter of Mr Rattray’s concerns is not an historic, cut-and-dried event but a phenomenon which recurs with notable frequency, the causes of which, and possible solutions for which, are prone to change as time passes and circumstances, in particular those that bear on the capacity of existing waste water management systems to cope with increasing demand, evolve. 59. Sixth, the fact that there may be other means (such as engaging in planning consultations) through which Mr Rattray is free to ventilate his concerns does not warrant an outcome denying him access to his right to freedom of information. 60. Seventh, on the material presented, and excluding points in dispute which we could not resolve without evidence, we reject the Council’s contention that Mr Rattray’s manner and tone in airing his concerns, through requests for information or otherwise, warrant the conclusion that the request under 15consideration is “manifestly unreasonable.” It is certainly true that he has complained vociferously that the Council has failed to live up to its responsibilities and has tried to minimise the problems to which he draws attention. He has also not hesitated to rehearse the history going back to 2012 and before but there is of itself nothing vexatious about that. Indeed, without doing so he would struggle to make his essential complaint, namely that responsible bodies have had ample time to get to grips with the serious flooding problem and, far from doing so and resolving it, have overseen a state of affairs in which, if anything, it has deteriorated. His comments may be unwelcome and perhaps uncomfortable on occasions for Council decision- makers but in a democratic society those who hold public office must accept robust challenge from time to time. It is not shown that he has said or done anything before the request or since 4 amounting to, or coming close to, harassment or abuse. There is no suggestion of distress or harm being suffered by Council staff. Outcome and postscript 61. We do not suggest that any of these reasons is individually determinative of the appeal. But we are satisfied that, taken together, they lead irresistibly to the conclusion that reg 12(4)(b) was not correctly applied. It follows that the appeal must be allowed. 62. Finally, we think that Mr Rattray would do well to think carefully before having further recourse to the freedom of information legislation. With every new request the risk of the Council meeting it with a successful defence under EIR, reg 12(4)(b) is likely to increase, particularly if our observations about the need to substitute evidence for mere assertion are taken on board. We would suggest that before any decision to present a further request for information he should ask himself in particular the following questions. (a) Does the proposed request repeat, or overlap (to any extent) with, any previous request? (b) Is the information reasonably necessary for the purposes of furthering any legitimate goal or objective? (c) Is the information available from some other source? (d) Does the proposed request for any other reason expose him to a real risk of being legitimately accused of a misuse of the freedom of information provisions? (e) Even if he is satisfied that the proposed request is proper in principle can it be improved by (i) making it more concise and/or (ii) narrowing its scope and/or (iii) clarifying the language in which it is couched? Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dated: 27 June 2019 4 The evidence relied upon by the Council is on its face irrelevant, since it post-dates the request. 16"
"401","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0180 Determined on the papers without an oral hearing On 14th November 2018 Before JUDGE FIONA HENDERSON TRIBUNAL MEMBERS ANNE CHAFER And NIGEL WATSON Between EDWARD WILLIAMS Appellant - and – THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER First Respondent - and – DRIVER AND VEHICLE LICENSING AGENCY Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONS (AMENDED PURSUANT TO RULE 40 GRC RULES 2009) Introduction 1. In the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50685170 dated 14th August 2017, the Commissioner held that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) were entitled to withhold the disputed information relying upon s31(1)(g) with 31(2)(b) FOIA. That matter was considered by this Tribunal following an oral hearing on 9th March 2018 and additional written submissions. The Tribunal allowed the Appellant’s appeal against that aspect of the decision notice in a decision dated 26th June 20181. 1 Annexed hereto. 12. Prior to the oral hearing the DVLA had applied to be permitted to rely upon further exemptions. These were dealt with in the Tribunal’s Judge’s ruling of 21st August 2018 in which the application to amend (so as to rely upon s41 in relation to certain specified documents) was allowed. S40(2) FOIA 3. In light of the Tribunal’s ruling relating to s31FOIA, the Information Commissioner (ICO) raised the issue of names, addresses and vehicle registration details for a number of private individuals who submitted complaints to DVLA2. Without a further ruling from the Tribunal that information was due to be disclosed. In their letter of 16th October 2018, the DVLA went beyond the point identified by the ICO stating: “In addition, the individual names and telephone number of all other individuals named in the closed bundle should be redacted pursuant to section 40(2) in DVLA’s submission”. The views of the other parties and the definition of the personal data that was encompassed within this application was canvassed by the Tribunal in its CMD of 13th November. 4. All parties have confirmed that they are content for the scope of the personal data to be as defined below and that they have no objection to redactions pursuant to s40(2) in these terms. Namely: i. The redaction of the names and job titles (for the names can be derived from job title) of employees of the DVLA or other organisations in their work capacity who have neither a public facing role nor hold a position of seniority (and hence accountability) within their organisation. ii. The redaction of direct line telephone numbers (rather than company switchboard numbers). iii. The redaction of a replication of a redacted name in an email address (but not the rest of the email address) so ordinarily the organisation or domain name would remain unredacted. 5. The Tribunal is satisfied that redactions pursuant to s40(2) FOIA should be made in these terms prior to disclosure because these individuals would not expect this personal data to be disclosed to the world at large, and such disclosure would be unfair to those individuals. The Tribunal has given examples of the application of this determination in the closed schedule. S41 FOIA Background 6. The DVLA provides vehicle keeper details to private entities where they have ‘reasonable cause’ for wanting them. It uses an electronic service for this process called the KADOE (‘Keeper At Date Of Event’) service, which allows authorised organisations (Customers) to obtain vehicle keeper details electronically through an automated system. The facility is provided under the KADOE contract. 2 see closed bundle pp.70A-L 27. The terms of the KADOE contract are in the public domain and include provision for disclosure of data received pursuant to the KADOE contract by a Customer to be disclosed to a sub-contractor 3 by that Customer if there is a written contract that requires the sub-contractor as Data Processor of the Customer to abide by: • the requirements in Schedule 2 of the KADOE contract, • the FCA Debt Collection Guidance and • the terms for sub-contractors set out in schedule 3. The prior written agreement of the DVLA is also required. 8. The DVLA became aware in 2015 that some parking companies were providing vehicle keeper information that had been provided by the DVLA to them under the KADOE contract, onwards to MIL Collections Ltd, a debt collection company that buys unpaid debts from private car parking companies. It is the Appellant’s case that these Penalty Charge Notices are then pursued aggressively and unfairly leading to significant additional cost and distress to a motorist.4 The DVLA commenced an investigation to consider these debt-purchasing arrangements, and whether or not they were done in compliance with the KADOE Contract. This investigation has considered: • Contractual compliance, • The position of the sub-contractor as data controller or processor. • The contractual arrangements between the party to the KADOE Contract (Customer) and MIL Collections Ltd. We are satisfied from the oral and written evidence that at the date of the DVLA’s consideration of the request, the investigation was not yet complete. Information Request 9. The Appellant’s request was: “Please provide all records relating [to] the action taken by the DVLA to prevent organisations selling driver details accessed under KADOE to MIL Collections Ltd.” 10. The information that has been identified arising from this request comprises the entirety of the disputed information. For the purposes of consideration of s41 FOIA the Tribunal has only been asked by the DVLA to consider a limited portion, namely pages: 14, 19, 23-24B, 28, 29, 30-40 and 46-49, 50 and 53, 57-8, 60, 60A-K, 61-61A, 62-45 . The DVLA have provided a gist in tabular form6. The documents withheld pursuant to s41 can be summarised as information consisting of: “submissions made to the DVLA by third parties (and attachments to those submissions), in response to enquiries made by DVLA regarding the KADOE contract and compliance with it.”7 11. It is the DVLA case that8: 3 P245 OB clause D5 4 P31 OB 5 As identified in the 3rd witness statement of Robert Toft, the DVLA gist of 3rd September 2018 (p 56bg OB) and the DVLA letter of 16th October 2018 (p56 br OB) 6 P56bg OB 7 ICO submissions para 8 p 56 bk OB 8 Letter 3rd September p 56 bf OB 3“All of the above relate to the commercial arrangements between private third parties, … the information is commercially confidential and was provided to DVLA in confidence as part of its investigation.” The Law 12. S41(1) FOIA provides an exemption to disclosure under FOIA if disclosure would constitute “an actionable breach of confidence”. Section 41 states: (1) Information is exempt information if— (a) it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and (b) the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person. 13. The Tribunal has divided the s41 withheld material into categories apparent from the gist as provided by the DVLA to enable it to deal with the arguments and its findings in general terms (without direct reference to the contents of the closed material) in the open document. It has provided a closed schedule which makes direct references to the contents of the withheld material. Information provided by a third party 14. The majority of the documents in issue are documents that have been provided to the DVLA by a third party. To the extent that some of the information relates to the contents of emails generated by the DVLA, the Tribunal is satisfied that where it refers to information that has been provided to it by a third party, that is also covered but if it is information provided by the DVLA it is not. The Tribunal has therefore distinguished between: i. The information provided by a third party (e.g. the identity of the parking companies involved); ii. The information provided by the DVLA that discusses information provided by a 3rd party (e.g. comments informed by knowledge of the terms of the contract by the DVLA); iii. As opposed to the DVLA’s input e.g. the direction of their investigation. 15. In our judgment whilst the Tribunal is satisfied that the majority of the information falls within i) and ii) above s41 is not engaged in some instances because the information that it is sought to withhold falls within iii). Actionable Breach of Confidence 16. We now go on to consider whether its disclosure under FOIA would constitute “an actionable breach of confidence”. The test for this was set out in Coco v Clark [2968] FSR 415 which can be summarised as: a. The information must have the necessary quality of confidence. b. The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. c. Disclosure of the information must to the detriment of the confider. d. There must be no defence to the action. 4The information must have the necessary quality of confidence. 17. The s41 withheld information includes9 the actual contracts between MIL and various parking companies. The DVLA’s case is that it is apparent from those documents that the parties had agreed a very high degree of commercial confidentiality and that it would be wrong for the DVLA (as the recipient) to go behind that commercial sensitivity. The ICO’s case is that the identified material has the necessary quality of confidence. They are not trivial, and contain information which would not otherwise be accessible to the public. 18. Where a document is explicitly marked confidential or the information is derived from a document which is explicitly marked confidential, and the information is not widely circulated or in the public domain, we are satisfied that the information will have the necessary quality of confidence. We accept from the face of these documents that the contents of the contract are intended to remain confidential. 19. In reaching this conclusion we accept that: i. There is no evidence before us to suggest that these contracts are in the public domain. ii. Commercial contracts are not generally available. They can be expected to include prices, structures, timetables and to demonstrate the concessions that are sought or given by the contracting parties and thus their commercial tolerance levels and thresholds. iii. From the terms of the contracts these were not intended to be widely available. iv. From the terms of the contracts and the fact that they were disclosed to the DVLA (who were not a party) it is reasonable to conclude that the expectation was that they would only be accessible to those bound by the contract and those who had an investigatory, regulatory or practical role which would impact upon the ability of the parties to fulfil the terms of the contract. 20. However, we find that some of the s41 disputed information does not pass this test as we are not satisfied that the identity of the parking companies involved is or was intended to remain confidential. In assessing this we look at the factual position at the date of the information request (rather than when the information was disclosed to the DVLA).10 Additionally we do not accept that the extent to which obligations from the KADOE contract (which is in the public domain) are imported into the contracts with MIL have the necessary quality of confidence about them even if that information is derived from or contained within clauses of the confidential contract11. 21. This is because: i. We are satisfied that due to way that debts purchased by MIL were pursued, the companies whose debts it had purchased would be widely known in the public domain. 9 P390 OB and p 56 bf OB 10 APPGER v ICO and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (UKUT 0377 (ACC), 2 July 2015) at or around the time when the request was considered by the public authority. 11 Eg p 390 OB 5ii. We have also had regard to the extent to which this information has already been placed in the public domain without restriction. iii. Similarly, the KADOE contract puts certain obligations on the contracts that parking companies have with sub-contractors12. The extent to which these are reflected in the contracts or documentation in our judgment would not have the necessary quality of confidence about it because it would be self-evident. iv. We have also had regard to information that was already in the public domain and without restriction which in our judgment would not pass this threshold. The information must have been given in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. 22. The DVLA argue that the information was provided to the DVLA subject to the commercial confidentiality being respected. They argue that this is apparent both from the face of some of the documents but also because of the nature of the contents. The ICO agrees that a reasonable person would have realised that such submissions were made to DVLA on the assumption that DVLA would keep them confidential. 23. We are satisfied that an explicit marking of confidentiality would import an obligation of confidence. We accept that where there is no explicit condition or marking, the test is whether a reasonable person in the position of the recipient would have realised that the information was provided in confidence13. 24. We are satisfied that the majority of the information reaches this threshold and have had regard to: • The circulation of the document (e.g. was it between DVLA and one organisation or was it cascaded further). In our judgment there is less expectation of confidentiality if a document is widely circulated amongst multiple organisations even if it is within a closed group. • The reason for the provision of the information or the purpose of the document. The DVLA were conducting an investigation, with the power to withhold the use of DVLA data. We are satisfied that this meant that there was an inequality of bargaining power in that companies had to co-operate and disclose documentation that ordinarily the DVLA or outside parties would not expect to see in order to preserve their business model. • What the recipients can be seen to have done with the information. Whether they sought permission to share it, whether they shared it with or without restriction. • Whether the contents of the documents are likely to inform the expectations of the parties. Receipt of a document which on its face is clearly sensitive brings with it a clearer expectation that the document is intended to be treated confidentially. Disclosure of the information must to the detriment of the confider. 25. The ICO argues that there is a considerable public interest in how KADOE data is used by organisations, and with whom it may be shared. Disclosure of third parties’ views 12 E.g. D5.1a which requires sub-contractors to abide by Schedule 2, Schedule 3 and D5.1b FCA Debt Collection Guidance and D5.1.c to have the prior written agreement of the DVLA. P245 OB 13 Coco v Clark, p.420-421 6and details about how they use such data would be likely to attract interest, which would result in reputational damage or the expenditure of resources in responding to further enquiries. 26. The Appellant disputes that disclosure would be detrimental14. He argues that there is no obligation to respond to further enquiries. As set out above the Tribunal repeats its findings as set out in paragraph 24 above in terms of the reasons why the parking companies would have had to provide information e.g. to preserve their access to KADOE and seek clarity as to the acceptableness of their business model. 27. The Appellant argues that 3rd parties who have acted without impropriety have nothing to fear as regards their reputations. The Tribunal is not satisfied that impropriety is necessary for reputational damage to occur. The sharing of personal data, especially in the context of the enforcement of parking fines, is an emotive issue which is likely to attract some negative attention. Additionally, we accept that the details of the arrangement would both attract interest, and increase discussion (some of this would also be negative in light of the emotive response that debt pursuit prompts and the public comments apparent from the information before the Tribunal) which in our judgment would amount to reputational damage. 28. The Appellant also argues that if the DVLA followed Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002 to check each request they would not need to rely upon 3rd parties. However, this is not material to the issues before this Tribunal which must deal with the facts as they are (namely the KADOE contract is in use). This argument does not address the arrangements for the pursuit of debt once disclosure has taken place in the first instance. 29. In assessing detriment, the Tribunal also considers the commercial impact upon the disclosers. In our judgment it would provide commercial inequality if MIL’s rivals were able to examine their business model, fee structures, cashflow, concessions and demands without reciprocity. Similarly, the parking companies who have entered into agreement with MIL would be prejudiced in seeking to negotiate different arrangements with MIL’s competitors having demonstrated their commercial tolerance thresholds and what they were prepared to agree to. There must be no defence to the action. 30. Although this is an absolute exemption (without the statutory requirement for consideration of the public interest pursuant to s2 FOIA), the Tribunal must nevertheless consider whether the public interest in disclosure overrides the public interest in maintaining the duty of confidence15. This is because the “public interest defence” to breach of confidence must NOT be available if the exemption is to be upheld. 31. The Commissioner’s view is that the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the duty of confidentiality. The factors identified in favour of maintaining the confidentiality of the information are: 14 email 28.9.18 15 Associated Newspapers Ltd v HRH Prince of Wales [2006] EWCA Civ 1776, [2008] Ch 57, paras 67-68 7There is strong public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of information received in confidence. 32. As was recognised in Associated Newspapers Ltd v HRH Prince of Wales the basis of the law’s protection of confidence is that there is a public interest that confidences should be preserved and protected by the law. We therefore give it due weight but recognise that the nature of the right is not absolute and is capable of being outweighed by some other countervailing public interest which favours disclosure. We have had regard as set out above to the consequences of disclosure and the significance of the information in informing the public debate. 33. There is public interest in ensuring information is only used and accessed appropriately via the KADOE service. DVLA’s enquiries into how information is used require the co-operation of third parties, who may be unwilling to provide submissions in future if they are disclosed to the public. The Tribunal does not consider that this factor carries significant weight. There is a commercial incentive to co-operate in order to ensure access to the data. The DVLA are the sole source of this information which they can withhold, the parties therefore have no option but to co-operate if they wish to continue to have access to the information. Failure to provide the information may lead the DVLA to suspect a breach in which case they can withhold future data and refer the matter to the ICO in its regulatory capacity. As such the Tribunal is not satisfied that co-operation is a significant factor in the proper investigation and regulation of this issue. 34. Transparency and accountability do not require this level of detail and the public interest can be met in less intrusive ways. The ICO argues that the public interest in disclosure of DVLA’s position as to how information can be shared, and its actions in ensuring information is only shared to that extent; can be met without disclosure of the disputed information in ways that do not compromise the confidentiality of third parties who have assisted DVLA in its enquiries. 35. The DVLA agrees arguing that the Appellant is already aware that there were arrangements in place between MIL and some private parking companies from the First witness statement of Robert Toft16. We take into account that it is also evident in the public domain that an operative consideration was whether there were in existence valid “sub-contractor” agreements17. However, we are satisfied that disclosure would provide more detail and greater clarity of the legal protections surrounding the onward disclosure of personal data and the legal justification for this. 36. We consider that this factor holds more weight in relation to items such as specific contract terms which provide more detail than is necessary for the purposes of debate and transparency. 37. The Commissioner argues that notwithstanding the significant interest in third party submissions, most weight should be given to the public interest in DVLA’s policy and 16 P107 OB 17 P390 OB 8actions, and not the views of third-party contractors. In our judgment this information is not so clearly separated. The extent to which their policy and actions are informed by some of these submissions and the way in which the DVLA has responded to them will inform the public debate as to the vigour, thoroughness and depth of the DVLA’s investigation into ensuring appropriate use and disclosure of personal data with which it has been entrusted. 38. The following public interest factors in favour of disclosure were identified by the Commissioner: a. There is a considerable public interest in how driver details are disclosed via the KADOE service particularly in the context of the enforcement of parking fines. The Tribunal agrees and adds that the fact that drivers who provide this information to DVLA do so not out of choice or voluntarily (as it is a legal requirement) significantly increases the weight of this factor. b. Disclosure of third-party submissions on this topic would allow the public to understand, to at least some extent, how organisations currently share information obtained through the KADOE service. The Tribunal repeats its observations at 33-34 above and are satisfied that disclosure of this information would add transparency and scrutiny that would not be possible without more detailed disclosure than that already in the public domain. c. Disclosure would also enable the public to see part of DVLA’s enquiries into, and consideration of, the sharing of KADOE information. 39. The Tribunal gives weight to all of these factors and adds that the extent to which and circumstances in which onward disclosure has been allowed to happen and the DVLA’s knowledge of any safeguards; in our judgment is an important factor in DVLA transparency, accountability and public confidence. Similarly, the vigour, speed and depth of any investigation is also of importance for the same reasons. 40. Additionally, we have had regard to the likely impact of onward disclosure for data subjects. We accept the Appellant’s submissions that there was public concern relating to the practices of some debt recovery companies18 who were believed to pursue debts unfairly. We are satisfied that the consequence of the debt sales for data subjects would be direct correspondence and potentially, litigation from an additional company (in the context of fears of unfair pursuit). In our judgment this is of high public interest which merits a high degree of transparency. 41. Having weighed all these factors, we are satisfied that in relation to much of the disputed information19 the public interest outweighs the maintenance of confidentiality and that as such a defence to the action would be likely to succeed. Conclusion 18 This is not a finding relating to MIL but a finding relating to the levels of public concern relating to debt recovery companies in general. 19 As set out in the closed annex 942. For the reasons set out above and in the closed annex we allow the appeal in part and have determined that apart from the information identified as properly withheld under s40 FOIA20 and s41 FOIA21 the rest of the information appearing in the closed bundle should be disclosed by DVLA to the Appellant within 35 days. 43. Following confirmation of the disclosure by DVLA as ordered in the closed table, it is intended that a redacted version of the closed document will be provided to the Appellant upon further order. 44. The Tribunal Judge confirms that all appeal rights associated with this decision, the decision of 26th June 2018 and the ruling dated 21st August 2018 now start to run.

The Fast Track Graduate Scheme is the primary route by which future senior civil servants enter their profession. The effective and fair administration of this scheme is consequently a matter of public importance. The Government is concerned to ensure this and each year a review of how the recruitment process is been conducted in that year is published as well as other studies commissioned by the Government. In February 2016 the Cabinet Office published a 146-page independent report containing detailed statistical analyses by the Bridge Group on recruitment into the Fast Stream Socio- Economic Diversity in the Fast Stream”. In the executive summary it stated: - “Senior colleagues in the Civil Service are actively engaged in efforts to secure socio- economic diversity in the Fast Stream, and many good practices are well developed. These include the collection and publication of socio-economic background (SEB) data, the removal of candidate screening criteria (e.g. UCAS points and university attended), the targeting of marketing activity based on campus diversity, and an internship programme exclusively for under-represented groups. Much progress has been made in relation to some diversity indicators, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and disability. However, in relation to socio-economic diversity, the Fast Stream is unrepresentative of the population at large. To put this in context, the profile of the intake is less diverse than the student population at the University of Oxford.” 2. In response, the late Sir Jeremy Heywood (then Cabinet Secretary) wrote in the foreword to the report on the 2016 recruitment cycle Fast Stream and Early Talent Annual Report 2016: - In response the Civil Service has moved quickly to improve our processes and introduce important changes to how we attract, assess and support individuals into the Fast Stream These changes include…. …the application experience has been significantly improved since 2016, with the 2017 process completing several months faster than before… Many of these changes are too early to be covered in the period of this annual report. But I am confident that the actions we are taking will improve the diversity of the Civil Service now and in the years to come. That means a fairer, more meritocratic and more effective Civil Service and one the whole country can be proud of.”3. That report contained a 43 page detailed analysis of the recruitment covering analysis of the relative success of applicants by university of the applicant’s first degree, class of degree, type of degree, by gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, socio-economic status of parents of applicants, eligibility for free school meals, which part of the fast stream applicants had applied to, together with some trend data exploring how the these rates had shifted over a time, the amount of trend data varying according to the length of time that particular data had been captured. The request for information 4. The Appellant in these proceedings sought information on 25 February 2016. He withdrew the request (believing he had an alternative source of information from his position within the Civil Service) but when this was unavailing he renewed the request on 5 September 2016. He asked: - 1) Could you please break down for me the number of applicants recommended for appointment to the Diplomatic and Parliamentary Fast Streams by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended? I would like this data for as many year groups as you can provide, within the FoI cost limits. 2) If you have the information, the number of applicants that advanced to the Final Selection Board for the Diplomatic and Parliamentary Fast Streams by Socio- Economic Background and University Attended. Again, I would like this data for as many year groups as you can provide, within the FoI cost limits. 3) If you have the information, could you please also indicate which Department 'Central Department' Fast Stream entrants were posted to, for their first posting, broken down by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended? 4) If you have the information, could you please also indicate the geographical distribution of 'Central Departments' Fast Stream entrants' first postings, broken down by Socio-Economic Background and University Attended?” 5. The Cabinet Office provided links to some published information and confirmed that other information was exempt from disclosure under FOIA under s21 and s22 (information available by other means (s21) or meant for future publication (s22)). Following the intervention of the Information Commissioner the Cabinet Office disclosed tables of data with redactions made under s40(2) (the protection of personal information) and withheld information relating to University attended relying on s23(1) and s24 (1) in the alternative (It should be noted that the exemption provided for under s23 is an absolute exemption; that under s24 is subject to a public interest balancing test): - (23) Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters (1) Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it was directly or indirectly supplied to the public authority by, or relates to, any of the bodies specified in subsection (3)(24) National security (1) Information which does not fall within section 23(1) is exempt information if exemption from section 1(1)(b) is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.) 6. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner. During the course of her investigation the Appellant confirmed that in seeking the socioeconomic background of applicants he was seeking information concerning their parents’ occupations. The Commissioner’s Decision 7. In her decision notice the Commissioner referred to her published guidance How sections 23 and 24 interact which may permit the two exemptions to be relied on in the alternative: - “26… To overcome this problem the Commissioner will allow public authorities to cite both exemptions ‘in the alternative’ when necessary. This means that although only one of the two exemptions can actually be engaged, the public authority may refer to both exemptions in its refusal notice. 38. Where the Commissioner finds in favour of the public authority, the decision notice will not allude to which exemption has actually been applied. It will simply say that the Commissioner is satisfied that one of the two exemptions cited is engaged and that, if the exemption is section 24(1), the public interest favours withholding the information.” 8. The need for this approach is explained in the decision of the Information Tribunal Baker v Information Commissioner. Applying this approach, she confirmed that section 24(1) can be engaged, since it is a qualified exemption a balance must be struck between the competing claims of public interest. In weighing the public interest, she noted that given the information already in the public domain there was little public interest in disclosing this level of information and concluded (DN paragraph 28): - However, the Commissioner accepts that the public interest in protecting information required for the purposes of safeguarding national security is a very strong one, and in the circumstances of this case, she has concluded that, on balance, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 9. In considering the application of the s40 exemption the Commissioner considered the unredacted raw data tables held by the Cabinet Office (DN para 34): -The information comprises data tables breaking Fast Stream applicants down by department and occupational status of parent 1 and parent 2. These occupational statuses are further broken down into 10 categories. 10. Given the small numbers involved she considered that the risk of identifying individuals from the data was real. She applied the first data protection principle: - “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless – (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.” 11. She then considered the rights and expectations of the data subjects (DN para 38), whether there could be an over-riding public interest in disclosure (DN 39) the Cabinet Office’s account of how the data had come to be in the form it was (DN 40-44) – the information was not held by the Cabinet Office in the form requested and the information provided was created by the Cabinet Office’s contractor in response to the request. She also considered the consequences of disclosure: - 45 The Cabinet Office confirmed that it had considered aggregation of multiple years of data but the numbers remained unacceptably small and it considered disclosure of aggregated data would still constitute a breach of the DPA. 46. The Cabinet Office explained that if a staff member could be identified this would, in turn, reveal the occupational status of his or her parents. 12. The Appellant argued that recruitment statistics had been published for over a decade and he had made his request as two particular sections of the fast stream were omitted. He argued that applicants consented to the publication of information when they applied and there was a strong public interest in establishing accurately whether the Government was attempting to meet its own diversity targets. 13. The Commissioner noted that applications had been informed that statistical information would be anonymised before publication, considered that given the scale of the numbers involved individuals could be identified, and from that their parent’s occupations and considered that disclosure of the redacted information met the need for transparency without risk of breaching the data protection principles and upheld the position adopted by the Cabinet Office. The Appellant’s arguments 14. The Appellant argued misconduct by the Commissioner and Cabinet Office in that they “knowingly misapplied” S40(2), s23(1) and 24(1) of FOIA and breached his rights under Article 10 ECHR.15. With respect to s40 he argued that the fast Stream Annual Report had three categories for socio-economic status but that the Cabinet Office had provided data divided into 10 categories which was not sought and this resulted in a large number of small groups of individuals where the data was then redacted. Further the Annual Report disclosed some data related to groups of individuals as low as two; there was unjustifiable inconsistency. 16. There had been no proper explanation of how the Commissioner or Cabinet Office came to conclusions on s23(1) and s24(1). However, the Cabinet Office had already published the information in an amalgamated form, some individuals had already published the information about themselves, neither the Houses of Parliament nor Foreign and Commonwealth Office were bodies within s23. 17. It was established jurisprudence of the ECHR that Article 10 included a right to seek information from public bodies Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary and that the tests laid down for exercising this right were met by him. The Respondents’ position 18. In resisting the appeal, the Commissioner confirmed the analysis of the data protection issues in the decision notice, observing there was no obligation on the Cabinet Office to create further information if it did not hold it at the time of the request. She noted that whether individuals could be identified from as small a data set as two depended on the surrounding circumstances; she had reviewed the redactions and concluded there was a possibility of identification if the redactions were not made. She maintained her position with respect to S23 and S24. She submitted that the effect of UK jurisprudence was that rights under FOIA were not the route by which any potential Article 10 right to information could be realised and accordingly the decision in Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary was of no assistance to the Appellant. 19. The Cabinet Office supported the Commissioner. Evidence 20. The tribunal heard evidence from Gregory Hobbs; a senior civil servant in the Cabinet Office with responsibilities for the administration of the Fast Stream. He confirmed that the privacy notices associated with the Fast Stream meant that applicants would not expect to be publicly identified from information they provided during the recruitment process, nor would their parents expect to be so identified from information supplied by their children. While some hundreds are recruited through the process each year the vast majority are recruited into a system where they are encouraged to move between departments. However, for recruits into the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice or to the staff of Parliament there is no such expectation or mechanism. The Houses of Parliament Scheme recruits between 2 and 4 entrants each year and in these circumstances the triangulation of the various pieces of information sought could lead to the identification of individuals. 21. He explained that the Cabinet Office had released redacted data sets with respect to generalist fast stream entrants’ parental occupations and by location and a document giving the number of applications which proceeded to the final selection board for the diplomatic fast stream by parental occupation for the years 2013-2015. These documents were prepared from data held by a private sector contractor and redactions had been carried out where the number of applicants in any category was less than or equal to five. The disclosure of further information would involve a breach of s40. In cross- examination the witness was taken to the statistical tables published in the Fast Stream Annual Report where he explained that small numbers of applicants in certain areas would not be easily identifiable as they rotated through different departments. In closed session the tribunal explored the relationship between the material and the exemptions under s23(1) and s24(1). 22. In his submissions the Appellant considered the history of recruitment to the civil service, the application of the duty under Constitutional Reform Act 2010 to recruit on merit. He argued that the decision in Kennedy should not be followed in the light of Magyar and that s23(1) and s24(1) were incompatible with his rights under Article 10. He argued that the exemptions contained in those sections denied him of information unlawfully. Consideration 23. In support of his challenge to the application of S40 to the material the Appellant pointed to the material voluntarily put into the public domain by some of the successful applications to the fast-stream. Analytically this is not helpful to his case. While some individuals have put such material into the public domain others have not and there is no indication that they would consent to such publication. On the contrary they have been given assurances that personal data will not be revealed. The publication of information in an “amalgamated form” does not, as the Appellant implied, mean that the information as personal data has been published. The tribunal is satisfied that, given the small number of some of the groups identified within the data, the publication of the data sought would mean individual applicants could be identified from it, as could their parents, together with information about the parents which could include the fact that a parent was unemployed. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that the material falls within s40 as personal data. 24. For the sake of completeness, the tribunal has considered whether Schedule 2 Condition 6 could have any application to considering whether the release ofthe information would be fair and lawful under the first data protection principle. This provides: - “6. — (1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 25. The Appellant’s legitimate interest is his desire to publish material on what he considers to be the failure of the Fast Stream recruitment process to recruit fairly from all parts of British society but rather to recruit disproportionately from graduates from a small number of universities with privileged family backgrounds. The difficulty however is that the Civil Service itself publishes a mass of quantitative data which demonstrates this as well as publishing its developing plans to redress the balance. The tiny increment of information which he seeking is not necessary to enable him to comment on this situation. 26. The Appellant relied heavily on the ECHR case of Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary in support of his argument that he had an article 10 right to the information requested. In that case a long-established human rights organisation sought information as to the appointment of public defenders, who in Hungary are appointed by the relevant local police force. The relationship between the defender and the prosecuting authority and the possibility of lack of independence of the public defender clearly raise issues as to an accused’s access to a fair trial. The information requested was denied on the basis that it was personal data of the public defenders and under the relevant Hungarian legislation “the respondent police departments cannot be obliged to surrender such personal data.” (Magyar paragraph 30). 27. In resisting the appeal by the Commissioner and Cabinet Office argued that the previously decided Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v Charity Commission had settled that Article 10 did not give a free-standing right of access to information held by public bodies. While in this case there was an absolute exemption from disclosure of the specific information sought under s32(2) other statutory or common law rights to information continued to exist side by side with the FOIA rights since s78 FOIA provided “Nothing in this Act is to be taken to limit the powers of a public authority to disclose information held by it.” There was therefore another route, an alternative remedy to FOIA through which individuals could obtain the information. 28. The First Section of ECHR in Times Newspapers Limited and Kennedy v UK considered the appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court in Kennedy acknowledged the existence of the alternative route to FOIA and stated (paragraph 82):- “Although the applicants have focussed their complaints on the Article 10 compliance of the “absolute exemption” under s32(2) of FOIA, in examining the complaints theCourt will have regard to the domestic legal framework as a whole and not simply the FOIA. While the Court has now recognised that Article 10 of the Convention might, under certain conditions, include a right to access to information (see Magyar..) it does not include a right of access to information by a particular legislative scheme. What matters, is whether the legislative framework as a whole satisfies the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, read in light of the Court’s most recent jurisprudence.” 29. If indeed the Appellant is correct in his interpretation of the impact of the decision in Magyar then for him to be entitled to receive the information the failure to disclose the information must breach Article 10: - 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary 30. Magyar identified four criteria which must be met. These were helpfully summarised by the tribunal in Moss: - • Purpose of request. As a prerequisite, the purpose of the request must be to enable [the requester’s] exercise of the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas to others. The information must be “necessary” for the exercise of freedom of expression; • Nature of information sought. The information must meet a legitimate public interest test to prompt a need for disclosure under the Convention. • Role of requester. The applicant must be in a privileged position, seeking the information with a view to informing the public in the capacity of a public watchdog. Such a privileged position should not be considered to constitute exclusive access. • Information ready and available. Weight should be given to the fact that the information requested is ready and available. 31. Where the right is protected by Article 10(1) Article 10(2) provides the framework for restrictions which are – are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security…32. The combination of s23(1) and 24(1) is such a restriction prescribed by law. The necessity to protect national security in a democratic society is, under FOIA weighed under S2(2) which provides: - (2) In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1(1)(b) does not apply if or to the extent that— …. (b)in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 33. In the light of the evidence it has heard and seen the tribunal has accepted that the exemption identified by the Cabinet Office as S23(1)/S24(1) applied. This means that, since S24(1) is a qualified privilege, a balancing exercise needs to be applied; weighing the public interest in disclosure (most relevantly the Appellant’s desire to publish discussed in paragraph 25 above) with the public interest in protecting national security. As discussed above; the interest in publication given the plethora of information provided by the Cabinet Office on the Fast Stream that interest is minimal. Due regard must be paid to the risk of harm to national security which greatly outweighs any interest in disclosure. 34. The tribunal is therefore satisfied that, if indeed an article 10 right is engaged, the balancing exercise produces no difference in result from that under FOIA. 35. The tribunal is satisfied that the Commissioner’s decision is correct in law and dismisses the appeal. Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 23/01/2019"
"421","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0064 Decided without a hearing On 15 November 2018 Representation: Proulagation Date 19th Febuary 2019 Before JUDGE BUCKLEY NARENDRA MAKANJI AND JEAN NELSON Between LONDON BOROUGH OF SUTTON Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION 1. For the reasons set out below the appeal is dismissed. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FER0690359 of 23 February 2018 which held that London Borough of Sutton Council (the Council’) 1had incorrectly applied regulation 12(5)(e) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (‘the EIR’). 2. The Commissioner required the Council to disclose the withheld information to which regulation 12(5)(e) had been applied. 3. We have read and taken account of a bundle of documents, including a closed bundle containing closed written submissions from the Council and a copy of the disputed information. We have read and taken account of submissions from all parties and witness statements on behalf of the Council from Rebecca Peck, Head of Customer Experience at the Council and from Amanda Cherrington, Managing Director of Sutton Decentralised Energy Network Limited and Head of Economic Renewal and Regeneration (employed by the Council). Factual background to the appeal 4. SDEN is a company wholly owned by the Council. It was set up in 2016 as a sustainable energy supplier to provide low-carbon energy to homes and businesses in Sutton. SDEN has a contract with Viridor under which it purchases energy at an agreed price. SDEN sells this energy on. At present it only sells some of the energy it purchases because it only has contracts relating to the new Barratt Homes development in Sutton. It has a contract with Barratt Homes and with the individual residents of the development who are required by covenants on the properties to use SDEN as their energy supplier. 5. The Council’s intention is that SDEN will secure other customers in the future. In doing so, it will be competing with other energy suppliers. A Financial Model for the SDEN business was commissioned by the Council. The model has been refined, particularly through the Financial Model Review by KPMG which is the subject of the request. Requests, Decision Notice and appeal 6. This appeal concerns a request made on 27 April 2017 by Councillor Nick Mattey. The Council provided much of the information requested. The request is set out in full in the Decision Notice, but the part of the request which was refused and therefore relevant to this appeal is: I would like to request information on Sutton Decentralised Energy Network (SDEN) Financial Model Review… The Council have paid £30,000 of tax payers money to pay for a Financial Model Review. Can I see it? This was advertised via: https://procontract.due– north.com/Advert?advertId=7502b4a4–6c60–e611–8114–000c29c9ba21 2Also see: http://contracts.contractsadvance.co.uk/tender- opportunity/215736/UKCarshalton-Sutton-Decentralised-ENergy-Network-SDEN- Financial-Model-Review I would like to put in a freedom of information request to receive a copy of this information so that I can if this project has any chance of providing value for money or rescuing people from fuel poverty. Can you tell me when the report was written and who has seen its contents? 7. The Council replied on 25 May 2017 refusing to provide the Financial Model Review on the basis that it was commercially confidential. 8. Mr Mattey applied for a review. On 27 June 2017 the Council upheld its decision. It stated that the request was for environmental information that fell within reg. 12(5)(e) and that the public interest favoured withholding the information. 9. In a decision notice dated 23 February 2018 the Commissioner decided: 9.1. The information was environmental. 9.2. The information was commercial. 9.3. The information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. 9.4. Confidentiality is not required to protect a legitimate economic interest. The Commissioner did not accept that the Council or third parties would, on the balance of probabilities suffer damage to their economic interests if the information were disclosed. 9.5. It was not necessary to consider the public interest. 10. The Council’s grounds of appeal are: 10.1. Reg. 12(5)(e) was not properly applied by the Council. 10.2. The public interest in maintaining the exception outweighed the public interest in disclosure. Legal framework 11. The EIR applies the provisions of Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on public access to environmental information to England and Wales. The relevant parts of reg. 12 are: Regulation 12: Exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information 12.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if— (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and 3(b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. … (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect— … (e) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest; 12. There is a presumption in favour of disclosure under the EIR under reg. 12(2). The result is that the threshold to justify non- disclosure is a high one. 13. Under reg. 12(5)(e), subject to the public interest test, a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest. This has four elements: 1. Was the information commercial or industrial? 2. Was the information subject to confidentiality provided by law? 3. Was that confidentiality to protect a legitimate economic interest? 4. Would disclosure adversely affect that confidentiality? 14. In Elmbridge Borough Council v Gladedale Group Limited EA/2010/0106 in paragraphs 18-19 the Tribunal considered the approach to the third question above, namely whether confidentiality was to protect a legitimate economic interest and concluded that disclosure would have to adversely affect a legitimate economic interest of the person the confidentiality is designed to protect and that this requires consideration of the sensitivity of the information and the nature of any harm that would be caused by disclosure. 15. The Tribunal in Elmbridge accepted that, taking into account the duty in paragraph 4.2 of Directive 2003/4 EC to interpret exceptions in a restrictive way, the wording “where such confidentiality is provided to protect a legitimate economic interest” (as opposed to “was provided”) indicates that the confidentiality of this information must be objectively required at the time of the request in order to protect a relevant interest and that it is not enough that some harm might be caused by disclosure. It is necessary to establish (on the balance of probabilities) that some harm to the economic interest would be caused by disclosure. 16. The Tribunal in Elmbridge noted that the implementation guide for the Aarhus Convention (on which the European Directive on access to environmental information and ultimately the EIR were based) gave the following guidance on legitimate economic interests: “Determine harm. Legitimate economic interest also implies that the exception may be invoked only if disclosure would significantly damage the interest in question and assist its competitors”. They found that this 4was consistent with the general scheme of Regulation 12(2) EIR which states that “a public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure” and with the EIR 12(5) exceptions, which require that “disclosure would adversely affect” the relevant interests identified in each exception. 17. ‘Would adversely effect’ should be interpreted in the sense that the adverse effect has to be identified and the Tribunal must be satisfied that disclosure “would” have that adverse effect, not that it “could” or “might”. (See Mersey Tunnel Users v ICO and Halton Borough Council EA/2009/0001). 18. If the conditions of 12(5)(e) are met, the information must only be disclosed to the extent that in all the circumstances the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 19. Having due regard to previous decisions, we consider that the relevant time for the application of the public interest test is the time of the initial request and refusals by the public authority not the time when the Tribunal hears the Appeal. Issues 20. It is accepted by both parties that the information was commercial and that it was subject to confidentiality provided by law. 21. The issues we have to determine are: 21.1. Was that confidentiality to protect a legitimate economic interest? 21.2. Would disclosure adversely affect that confidentiality? 21.3. If so, does the public interest in maintaining the exception outweigh the public interest in disclosing the information? The role of the tribunal 22. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Discussion and conclusions Is the exception engaged? 23. There is no challenge to the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that the information is commercial or that it is subject to a common law duty of confidence. 524. We therefore need to consider the question of whether or not the confidentiality was required to protect a legitimate interest and whether that confidentiality would be adversely affected by disclosure. We adopt the approach in Elmbridge and therefore the question is whether or not, on the balance of probabilities disclosure would cause some harm to the economic interests of the relevant parties. 25. The Council identified the following harm: 1. SDEN plans to secure future customers in addition to Barratt Homes. Negotiations with these future customers would be prejudiced by the release of the information. 2. There are a number of existing private sector owned and operated Energy Services Companies developing similar schemes in the UK. They would be direct competitors if they were to attempt to enter the SDEN target area and attempt to develop rival schemes. Disclosure of the information in the review would give these competitors a competitive advantage. 3. Disclosure would affect Viridor’s ability to negotiate higher prices with other customers if the price agreed to sell the energy to SDEN was made public. 4. Disclosure would reveal Viridor’s commercial and operational drivers and would put Viridor at a serious disadvantage to its competitors because they would have a better understanding of how Viridor operates its business. 5. There are ongoing negotiations with Barratt Homes and residents of that development where they are seeking to renegotiation their contractual terms. Knowing the price that SDEN had paid Viridoor would prejudice SDEN’s position in those negotiations. 26. In relation to (1) above, we do not accept that the evidence shows that on the balance of probabilities disclosure would cause the identified harm. There were no potential other customers in existence at the time of disclosure. Without any suggestion of when these potential future customers might be approached or any indication of their identity we cannot conclude, on the balance of probabilities that those negotiations would be affected. We accept that there is a potential risk that this harm might arise, but that is insufficient. 27. In relation to (2) above, we do not accept that the evidence shows that on the balance of probabilities disclosure would cause the identified harm. There is no suggestion that SDEN currently has any direct competitors or that any other company has any intention to either attempt to enter the SDEN target area and develop a rival scheme. We accept that there is a potential risk of this harm occurring but that is not sufficient. 628. In relation to (3) above, we accept, on the balance of probabilities that some harm would be caused to Viridor’s legitimate economic interests if the price that was paid by SDEN at that time was released. This is more likely than not to negatively affect their negotiating position with other customers. 29. In relation to (4), other than the prices details covered in (3) above, the letter from Viridor is insufficient to persuade us, on the balance of probabilities, that such harm would result from disclosure. The letter is referring to the SDEN Financial Model rather than the review. It does not identify which specific information in the Review would reveal Viridor’s commercial and operational drivers and on reading the Review the Tribunal is unable to identify what that information might be. 30. In relation to (5) above we accept that the disclosure of the price paid to Viridor would, on the balance of probabilities, have some negative impact on the Council’s negotiating position in ongoing contractual negotiations with Barratt Homes and the residents. 31. On the basis of the above we find on the balance of probabilities that some harm would be caused to the economic interests of SDEN or Viridor by disclosure and therefore we accept that confidentiality was required to protect a legitimate interest and that confidentiality would be adversely affected by disclosure. 32. In the light of the above findings, we do not find it necessary to make findings on whether or not the financial model review amounted to a trade secret. Public interest balance 33. We do not accept the Appellant’s submissions that the presumption in favour of disclosure in reg 12(2) is in practice ‘displaced’ in relation to reg 12(5)(e) because of the inbuilt interest in protecting trade secrets and confidential information. This is contrary to the clear wording of the statute which applies reg 12(2) to 12(5)(e). 34. We do not think it is helpful or necessary for the purposes of the public interest balance to identify whether this information should or should not be classed as a ‘trade secret’. Instead we have factored into our consideration of the public interest the characteristics of the information which might lead to such a classification. 35. We accept that there is reasonably strong public interest in this case in maintaining the exemption. We accept that the Council has invested significant intellectual effort in producing the Financial Model itself. We have not seen the Model, but we accept, in the absence of any contradictory evidence, the evidence of Ms Cherrington that the Review contains all the material elements of the Financial Model. We accept that there is a potential risk that the release of the review in June 2017 could have been used by potential competitors, but we do not put a lot of weight on this risk, because there were no direct competitors operating in that area 7at the time. Similarly, we do not place a lot of weight on the potential risk to potential future negotiations with potential future customers. Further we accept the Commissioner’s argument that these potential risks, are to some extent, the inevitable consequence of the Council and its subsidiaries competing with private companies that are not subject to the same obligations. 36. We accept that Viridor’s other customers would be aware of a snapshot of the prices agreed with SDEN at a particular point in time, and that this would have some impact on Viridor’s negotiating position for a limited period. We find however that Viridor would have been aware that the Council was subject to responsibilities to disclose information under the EIR and therefore would have been aware of the risk of disclosure of this type of information. Finally, we accept that there would be some effect on ongoing negotiations with Barratt Homes and its residents by the release of the prices paid to Viridor. In the absence of any information as to the content of this negotiation or any evidence on the nature or extent of the suggested effect, we do not place a significant weight on this consequence. 37. We find that there is a very significant public interest in disclosure in this case. A very large sum of public money is being invested in a long-term scheme lasting more than 25 years. Local residents purchasing properties in the Barratt development enter into contracts for energy supplied from SDEN for 25 years. It is a matter of important local significance. It has been publicly stated by the Council that the scheme would help alleviate fuel poverty. There is therefore also some public interest in the public knowing whether or not fuel poverty is referred to in the financial model review. 38. If the scheme fails there are significant risks to public money. There is a strong public interest in the public having access to information on how the project is proposed to function and how, if at all, it is eventually intended to make a profit. There is a strong public interest in the public being properly informed and therefore being able to make a more informed decision in both challenging and supporting the proposed scheme. 39. For the reasons set out above we conclude that despite the reasonably strong public interest in maintaining the exemption, it does not outweigh the very significant public interest in disclosure.

For the reasons set out below the appeal is dismissed. REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50665772 of 28 September 2017 which held that the request was for personal data and that confirming or denying whether the requested data was held would breach the first data protection principle and therefore the Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys Police 1(‘the public authority’) was correct to rely on s 40(5) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and neither confirm or deny whether it held the requested information. Factual background to the appeal 2. This request arises out of the Appellant’s arrest and detention at Aberystwyth police station in September 2008. The Appellant has a number of complaints about the conduct of the police. 3. The Appellant asserts, amongst other things, that the custody records were tampered with and that lies have been told about which officer he spoke to. Relevantly he asserts that the officer had not been promoted to the appropriate rank at the relevant time. 4. These complaints have been considered by the IPCC and in a number of court cases, none of which have resolved the matter to the Appellant’s satisfaction. The Appellant also complains that the IPCC’s report has not been acted upon. Request, Decision Notice and appeal 5. The Appellant made the request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which is the subject of this appeal on 20 December 2016: I am seeking the information upon a retires [name and rank redacted] from dyfed powys police who is referred to in the psd report of [name redacted] who was over seeing as so stated in his report of my many complaints the reason why I require this information. Is im am doing a reports requested with evidence to the ipcc as this [name and rank redacted] DYP now retired. …I am requesting to what date and time was this new grade given making him [name and rank redacted] (sic) 6. The Appellant subsequently clarified that his request was for the date the named officer was promoted. 7. The public authority replied on 12 January 2017. It refused to confirm or deny if it held the information. It relied on s 40(5) of FOIA. 8. An internal review was conducted on 7 March 2017 and the public authority upheld its original decision. 9. In its decision notice dated 28 September 2017 the Commissioner concluded that the information requested, i.e. the date of a named individual’s promotion, was personal data. In assessing fairness the Commissioner took account of the reasonable expectations of the individual that information of the type requested would not be disclosed. Disclosure could cause unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress to the individual. The Commissioner concluded that in the absence of a compelling public interest in disclosure it would be unfair for the public authority to confirm or deny that it held the requested information. 210. The Grounds of Appeal are contained in a wide-ranging letter dated 15 October 2017 and an email dated 23 October 2017. The Appellant covers a number of issues not relevant to the issues in this appeal, but the essence of his grounds appear to be: 10.1. The information will be used in an appeal to be heard in the Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ). 10.2. The information will not be released to the public. It is for the Appellant’s own use and if required in the RCJ hearing. 10.3. It is needed by solicitors who are doing his CCRC appeal. 10.4. It is needed for his civil case against the Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys Police. 10.5. He needs it to establish that he has been lied to by the public authority and others, including in particular lies about whether he was seen by this individual during his detention in September 2008 and the date of promotion of the individual. 10.6. This is needed in his appeal to establish perjury and his unlawful detention and abuse by the public authority in September 2008. 11. The Commissioner’s response states: 11.1. The information requested identifies and relates to a named individual. It is therefore personal data. 11.2. It would not be fair to confirm or deny to the world at large whether or not the named individual was a police officer with the public authority at the relevant time because of that individual’s reasonable expectations and the consequences of disclosure. 11.3. The Appellant has not provided any arguments explaining what interest he has in the public authority confirming or denying that the individual was a police officer at the time of the request. The general public interest does not outweigh the consequences for the individual. Legal framework S 40 – Personal Information 12. The relevant parts of s 40 of FOIA provide: (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if- (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is- (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a)-(d) of the definition of ‘data’ in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles... … (5) The duty to confirm or deny— … (b) does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either 3(i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 191)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles... 13. Personal data is defined in s1(1) Data Protection Act 1998 (‘DPA’) as: data which relate to a living individual who can be identified – (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller.. 14. The first data protection principle is the one of relevance in this appeal. This provides that: 1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless - (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met...” (See para.1 Sch 1 DPA). 15. The only potentially relevant condition in Schedule 2 DPA is section 6(1) which provides that the disclosure is: necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.’ (See para.s 6 Sch. 2 DPA) 16. The case law on section 6(1) has established that it requires the following three questions to be answered: 16.1. Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? 16.2. Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? 16.3. Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? The Task of the Tribunal 17. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether she should have exercised it differently. The tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Issues 18. The issues we have to determine are: 18.1. Was the information requested personal data? 18.2. Would confirming or denying the information be fair? 18.3. If so, are the conditions in 6(1) met i.e. 18.3.1. Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? 18.3.2. Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? 18.3.3. Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? 4Evidence and submissions 19. We have read and were referred to an open and a closed bundle of documents, which we have taken account of where relevant. Discussion and conclusions 20. We conclude that the information requested was personal data – the date of promotion of a named individual falls within that category. 21. We agree with the Commissioner that the individual would not reasonably expect the public authority to disclose whether or not he was a police officer with them, in accordance with the public authority’s usual practice. We think that a retired police officer in particular would have this reasonable expectation. 22. We accept the public authority’s assessment of the consequences of releasing this information namely that it places that individual and members of their family at the risk summarised in the Decision Notice. Further, whatever the Appellant intends to do with the information, disclosure under the FOIA is disclosure to the public, not just to the Appellant, and we take that into account. 23. Further we have considered whether there is a more compelling public interest in disclosure. It is apparent from the documents in the bundle that the issues arising from the Appellant’s arrest in 2008 have already been aired in a number of forums, although not to the Appellant’s satisfaction. If the information is relevant to ongoing litigation in the RCJ or the high court then that court is the appropriate body to consider ordering disclosure of that information. The Appellant has not provided sufficiently clear information on the nature of the proceedings to enable the tribunal to see the relevance of that information. In any event, the tribunal notes that the Appellant is currently subject to a civil restraint order, the terms of which make it unlikely that he is able to pursue any civil claim in which the requested information would be relevant. 24. For those reasons the tribunal concludes that it would not be fair to confirm or deny that the information was held. In the circumstances it is not necessary to consider section 6(1), but we would have concluded for the reasons set out above that disclosure was not necessary to pursue a legitimate interest and that the prejudice to the officer’s rights and freedoms outlined above would mean that disclosure was unwarranted. 25. This appeal is dismissed. Our decision is unanimous. 5Signed Sophie Buckley Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 14 January 2019 Promulgation date: 22 January 2019 6"

The appeal is dismissed. REASONS Background to Appeal 2. The Appellant made a request to Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service (“the Service”) on 2 December 2017 in the following terms: “In your draft IMRP for 2018-22 you state that ‘over 70% of incidents we attend could be fully dealt with by a crew of two’. I will be grateful if you could send me a copy of the evidence that this statement is based on, including any research papers and risk assessments”. 3. The Service replied on 4 January 2018, disclosing certain information within the scope of the request. It explained that the statement was based on an approximation of the incidents which could be handled by a smaller crew. Its response was upheld on internal review. 4. The Appellant complained to the Information Commissioner that the Service had failed to disclose additional information (the “raw data”) which he thought it must hold. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50727840 on 24 July 2018, in which she found on the balance of probabilities that no additional information was held. She required no steps to be taken by the Service. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal. Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 13 August 2018 relied on an alleged error of law by the Information Commissioner in reaching her conclusion that no more information was held. 6. The Respondent’s Response dated 27 September 2018 (amended 5 October 2018) maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. The Law 7. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or 2(b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 8. The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. Conclusion 9. Whilst I can see why the Appellant considers that more information must be held by the Service, the question for me to decide is more nuanced. I must consider whether the “raw data” he seeks falls within the scope of the request he actually made. 10. Having considered the matter carefully, I find I am not persuaded that a request for evidence including research papers and risk assessments can reasonably be understood also to include within its scope the raw data which underpins such documents. The Appellant may of course wish to make a further information request which is more specifically-worded. 11. In these circumstances, I discern no error of law in the Decision Notice which is the subject of this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is hereby dismissed.

For the reasons set out below the Tribunal allows the appeal and issues the following substitute decision notice. SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: Warwickshire County Council Complainant: Amit Matalia The Substitute Decision 1. For the reasons set out below the Public Authority was not entitled to refuse the complainant’s request for information made on 24 March 2017 on the grounds that it was vexatious. Action Required 2. The Public Authority is required to respond to the complainant’s request within 35 days of the promulgation of this judgment either by supplying the information or by serving a refusal notice under s 17 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), indicating what grounds they rely on other than s 14(1). REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against the Commissioner’s decision notice FS50700113 of 4 May 2018 which held that Warwickshire County Council (‘the Council) had correctly applied s 14(1) of FOIA. The Commissioner did not require the public authority to take any steps. Evidence and submissions 2. We have read and were referred to a bundle of documents. We heard evidence from Ms Hiller on behalf of the Council and oral argument from the Council and Mr Matalia. Factual background to the appeal 3. This matter arises out of an application for a place at a grammar school (‘the school’) for Mr Matalia’s son commencing in September 2013. It is not necessary for us to make detailed findings of fact about all matters relating to that application, and what follows is a summary of what happened based on the documents we had before us. 24. The admissions authority at that time was the governing body of the school (‘the governing body’). The Council offers places on behalf of the governing body. 5. The application was made to the Council’s Admissions Service by Mr Matalia in November 2012. At the time of the application Mr Matalia lived in Coventry, but stated that he would be moving to a house that he owned in Rugby before September 2013. In March 2013 the governing body decided to offer Mr Matalia’s son a place on the basis of the Rugby address. 6. The governing body subsequently decided to withdraw the place on the basis that the application was fraudulent or misleading. The withdrawal of the place was communicated to Mr Matalia on 17 July 2013. He was not given the opportunity to appeal. 7. The Council had taken the view at the time that if the offer was withdrawn Mr Matalia’s son would go straight to the top of the school’s waiting list because of his 11 plus scores. The Council’s view was that the school would then have to offer him the place which had become available when his offer was withdrawn. This is not what happened. The governing body withdrew the offer and offered it to another child already on the waiting list. 8. The governing body then considered Mr Matalia’s application afresh treating it as still based on the Rugby address. They reached the conclusion that the application was fraudulent and misleading and ‘rejected’ the application, refusing Mr Matalia the opportunity to appeal. 9. On 19 May 2014 the Local Government Ombudsman determined that the governing body were at fault for failing to consider Mr Matalia’s application properly afresh and failing to offer him an appeal. 10. Mr Matalia was then given the opportunity to bring an appeal before an Independent Appeal Panel (IAP). On 24 November 2014 the appeal was allowed and it was determined that Mr Matalia’s son should be offered a place at the school. The IAP observed that they were ‘not able to reach the same conclusion’ as the school on the issue of the original offer being made on the basis of a fraudulent or intentionally misleading application. The IAP found that the governing body should not have used the Rugby address when considering the application afresh and therefore a place ought to have been offered. In the alternative, it was not possible under the School Admissions Code 2012 to ‘reject’ an application: if they had ‘refused’ the application Mr Matalia’s son would have been placed on the waiting list where he would have been offered a place because of his 11 plus score. 11. Mr Matalia’s son was offered a place. There is a dispute as to why this place was not ultimately taken up, but it is not necessary for us to make findings of fact on this. 312. Mr Matalia has made 11 previous FOI requests arising out of the dispute relating to the school’s handling of his application for a place for his son (‘the school application’). 10 of those requests took place before the IAP made its determination in November 2014: 9 July 2013 1 August 2013 22 August 2013 23 September 2013 26 February 2013 18 March 2013 2 April 2014 (as regards 2 of the requests made on this date) 8 April 2014 10 April 2014 13. Mr Matalia has also made a number of FOI requests to the Council on a different topic, which we refer to as ‘the 11+ issue’, some of which were the subject of a First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) decision dated 5 May 2015 in EA/2014/0284. Mr Matalia publishes a number of websites intended for parents whose children are taking the 11+. In this role, Mr Matalia is critical of the Council’s testing processes, in particular the practice of holding 11+ tests on more than one date. On the basis of the documents in the bundle we find that he has published information obtained in response to these requests on his websites. He has also published a plethora of other information related to this topic on his websites, resulting at one stage in the Council obtaining an injunction to prevent him publishing certain information which was found to be confidential. 14. We accept, in the absence of submissions to the contrary, that Mr Matalia made 15 requests relating to the 11+ issue including a number of requests related to the injunction proceedings. 8 and 31 October (both requests) 2013 11 February, 19 March and 2 April 2014 Part of request on 29 May 2015, 2 December 2015 1 February, 4 May, 13 July, 9 October, 28 October, 24 November and 27 February 2017. 15. The previous first tier tribunal (EA/2014/0284) found that the requests before it which related to the 11+ issue had a wider value to members of the public and were not vexatious. 16. The previous first tier tribunal did not need to make any findings on the school application requests. It did make a number of obiter observations about the position in April 2014 as follows: 4The culmination of the sequence of requests regarding the subject of withdrawal of the offer might well be seen as justifying reliance on s 14(1). (para 23) They [the 11+ requests] marked a clear change of direction from the barrage of requests on the previous topic. (para 25) …the fact that earlier requests may have been vexatious does not, of itself, condemn later requests on a distinct, if related topic. (para 28) 17. After the request in April 2014 there was a gap of almost 18 months before the next request that related, at least in part, to the school application. That request was made on 29 September 2015. No other requests were then made relating to the school application until the current request on 24 March 2017 – another 18- month gap. 18. In July 2018 Mr Matalia issued a claim of misfeasance in public office against certain individuals linked to the school and the school academy trust. This claim is based, in part, on the allegation that the school acted in wilful disregard of the risk of illegality or without an honest belief in the legality of their actions in withdrawing the offer and not allowing an appeal. The Council is not a defendant to this action. 19. The Particulars of Claim rely on a letter dated 14 June 2013 and an email dated 5 July 2013 from the Lead Officer, Pupil and Student Services at the Council to the Headmaster of the school. They set out the Council’s view and its recommendations on the governing body’s proposal to withdraw the offer to Mr Matalia’s son. These letters were not in Mr Matalia’s possession at the time of the request or review. He received them after the Council’s internal review of its response to a Subject Access Request made by Mr Matalia on 8 May 2017. 20. The Particulars of Claim state, at paragraph 7: The Claimant will rely on the terms of that letter (‘the letter of 14 June 2013”) in full at trial. Before trial, and for the purposes of these Particulars of Claim, it is the Claimant’s case that the letter made it clear to the Governing Body and its members… that it would be unlawful… to withdraw the Offer. 21. The Particulars of Claim then set out a number of substantial extracts from the letter of 14 June 2013 and the email of 5 July 2013. Requests, Decision Notice and appeal The Request 22. This appeal concerns the following request made on 24 March 2017: I ask the following questions under the FOIA regarding my son, [redacted], and [redacted] School due to pending litigation… There are a number of questions, 5but they are fairly simple and I believe the questions can be answered in less than an hour. 1. Is it correct that formal responsibility for determining [the school’s] student admissions in 2013 rested with the LSS’s governors? However, in discharging these responsibilities in relation to year 7 the governors had adopted the County Council’s procedure for selective admissions? (3rd paragraph of admissions code in 2013). 2. Is it correct WCC has no record of any mechanism for [the school] to take admissions back in house for 2013 as the admissions policy did not state there was? (Once published the policy cannot be changed and the school adopted the Councils procedures for selective admissions and there is no way to reverse it without permission from the secretary of state – which was not obtained). 3. According to the County Council’s procedure for selective admissions for 2013 if a future change in address is not accepted, then there was only one option – to reject the future change in address and use the original address to process the application? There was no option to reject the application (especially once it had been accepted by WCC and a place offered). If not, what were the other options and provide documentary evidence)? 4. In essence in the case of [Mr Matalia’s son], if [the school] rejected the future Rugby address all it could have done under the County Council’s procedure for selective admissions was to use the original Coventry address for admissions. If so, is it correct [Mr Matalia’s son] would have been offered a place? 5. Is it correct every school applied for accepted [Mr Matalia’s son]’s future change of address, except [the school]? 6. Is it correct that WCC refused to withdraw [Mr Matalia’s son] ‘s place on 4 occasions? If not then on how many occasions? 7. Did the Council’s procedure for selective admissions allow [Mr Matalia’s son] ‘s place to be withdrawn? 8. Did [Mr Matalia’s son] ‘s application comply with the County Council’s procedure for selective admissions? 9. Did WCC except that the application for [Mr Matalia’s son] was not fraudulent (hence accepted the application)? 10. Did WCC accept that the application for [Mr Matalia’s son] was not misleading (hence accepted the application)? 11. I understand there was a meeting between [the school] and WCC regarding [Mr Matalia’s son]’s place where WCC refused to withdraw the place. I understand John Galbraith was at the meeting for the school. Where was 6this meeting held and how many of [the school] Governors were at the school? Please name the Governors who attended. 12. Was it the legal view of WCC that withdrawal of [Mr Matalia’s son]’s place by [the school] was unlawful? 13. Did WCC inform [the school] that withdrawal of [Mr Matalia’s son]’s place was unlawful? If yes, on how many occasions? 14. Was it the view of WCC that [the school] had to offer an appeal to [Mr Matalia’s son] and could not simply refuse to offer an appeal? Did they tell this to [the school]? If so, who did they inform? 15. Was it the view of WCC that [the school] could not simply reject an application and had to process it? Did they inform [ the school]? If so, who did they inform? 16. Was it the view of WCC that the application for [Mr Matalia’s son] to [the school] was not fraudulent? Was [the school] told, if so who? 17. Was it the view of WCC that it was impossible to determine if the application for [Mr Matalia’s son ] was fraudulent until the first day of term, because only on that day could one determine whether a move had taken place. If so, did the inform [ the school ] and if so, who? 18. Was it the view of WCC that refusal to place [Mr Matalia’s son] on the [ school] waiting-list was unlawful. Did WCC tell [the school], and if so who? 19. Was WCC (Craig Pratt) provided with documentary evidence of a move to Rugby by the first day of term? 20. Please confirm the average time it had taken [the school] to process or consider an application for a place in 2013. Eg 1 day, 1 week. 21. State how long it took [the school ] to process the second application of [Mr Matalia’s son ]. 22. Who did WCC communicate with from [the school] regarding [Mr Matalia’s son] ‘s place? 23. Who was the main point of contact at [the school] for [Mr Matalia’s son]’s application? 24. Was the time period to consider [Mr Matalia’s son]’s second application significantly longer than any other child? 25. Was the school capable of processing the application immediately – stating the school was full and placing him on the waiting list? Was this what was expected under the County Council ‘s procedure for selective admissions? 726. Did Amy Taylor feel that the admissions issue may cause stress and anxiety to [Mr Matalia’s son] and his family and felt the decisions should be quick to avoid this (you may wish to check her emails). i.e. did she believe the threat of withdrawing a place would cause a reasonable person stress and anxiety? 27. On how many occasions in the last 10 years has [the school] refused to process a school application (excluding [Mr Matalia’s son])? 28. On how many occasions in the last 10 years did [the school] reject a school application (excluding [Mr Matalia’s son])? 29. On how many occasions in the last 10 years did [the school] refuse to offer an appeal (excluding all incidents of [Mr Matalia’s son])? 30. Excluding [Mr Matalia’s son ], on how many occasions in the last 10 years did [the school ] take back admissions inhouse for an individual applicant and on how many times was a place withdrawn? 31. How many families registered a change of address who were offered places at [the school] in 2013? How many of these children had their places removed? How many had their addresses questioned by [the school]? The Council’s reply 23. The Council replied by letter dated 25 April 2017 refusing to comply because it had decided the request was vexatious within s 14(1) of the FOIA. We have considered the response in detail but the salient points are as follows. 24. The letter included a timeline setting out all the previous requests submitted by Mr Matalia to the Council on the same and related matters. The Council calculated that Mr Matalia had made 28 FOI requests over a period of 5 years and 5 months. Of those requests the Council determined that 12 previous requests (plus the current request) related to the school application. As the Commissioner notes in her Decision Notice this is a miscalculation and there are in fact 11 requests. The dates are set out above. The Council determined that 15 requests related to Mr Matalia’s complaint about the Council’s testing process and/or to injunction proceedings against Mr Matalia, on the dates set out above. There was one additional request related to a different complaint dated 26 October 2012. 25. The Council considered the current request in the particular context of the 12 other requests on the same theme of the school application. It also took account of the background context of the other unrelated requests/disputes with the Council. The Council considered whether or not the request was vexatious by considering the factors in Information Commissioner v Devon County Council v Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440: 8Burden on the authority 26. The request contains 31 numbered questions which break down into 47 distinct questions. It would take a considerable time to address each one. The Council would first have to decide if the questions were requests for recorded information or requests for opinions and views. It would take significant effort to locate where the information might be contained, because the dispute happened in 2013 and some Council officers are no longer at the Council. The burden would therefore be grossly oppressive and put undue strain on the Council’s resources. Personal grudge 27. The naming of individual officers in the request in questions 11, 19 and 26 are an attempt to further a personal grudge against those people. Mr Matalia has previously threatened police action against Council employees and accused them of perjury. Unreasonable persistence 28. Mr Matalia has made 13 requests relating to the same issue. It was resolved in 2014. The Council was unaware of any legal avenue in which Mr Matalia could pursue it further and therefore concluded that the request was an attempt to reopen an issue for the sole purpose of causing disruption and annoyance to the Council. Futile requests 29. The issue about the school admission has been conclusively resolved. Serious purpose and value 30. Assuming litigation were to take place, information which showed the Council’s view on the legality of the school’s actions would not assist Mr Matalia’s case. Wider public interest 31. Most of the information obtained in previous requests has not been published on Mr Matalia’s website. If the information was provided it would not be used by Mr Matalia to assist other parents, but as part of a campaign against the Council resulting from a personal grudge. Information already in Mr Matalia’s possession 32. Questions 19 and 26 relate to information already in Mr Matalia’s possession. This is an inappropriate use of FOIA. 33. The Council considered whether it was appropriate to rely on s 40(1) but decided that it was not engaged. 34. Mr Matalia requested an internal review. He was informed on 30 August 2017 that the original decision had been upheld. The review made the following additional point about burden: while the request may not have been vexatious 9considered in isolation it becomes so in the context of Mr Matalia’s involvement with the Council and other requests on the same theme. Taken together the burden has become grossly oppressive. 35. Mr Matalia referred the matter to the Information Commissioner on 10 September 2017. The Decision Notice 36. In a decision notice dated 4 May 2018 the Commissioner decided that the Council had correctly applied s 14(1) FOIA (vexatious request). 37. The Commissioner decided as follows: 1. Approximately 18 months passed between the last request in this category and this request, so it did not form part of a series of frequent requests. The circumstances had changed. It was not ‘more of the same’. It would not be grossly excessive or burdensome to deal with the current request in isolation. 2. The request was not a deliberate attempt to further any personal grudges or cause distress to Council officers. 3. The request did not have serious value and purpose. There was no evidence to suggest that the information requested would be of value to any other parents or third parties. It was difficult to identify what further information could be provided that would be of any further value in litigation or otherwise. The Court in any future litigation can ask questions and compel a third party to answer. 4. The past dealings and contact with the Council do have some relevance. 5. A significant part of the request asked for the Council’s view or opinion and the Commissioner doubted that the Council held information which would answer many of the questions. 6. There was a realistic possibility that Mr Matalia will continue to ask questions. 7. In conclusion, the Council had demonstrated that a point had been reached where it was no longer reasonable for it to expend further resources dealing with requests made by Mr Matalia which have no serious purpose or value either to Mr Matalia or the wider public. Notice of Appeal 38. Mr Matalia appealed against the Commissioner’s decision notice. In summary, the relevant parts of the notice of appeal challenge the Commissioner’s decision notice on the grounds that: 1. The information requested has serious purpose or value. It is relevant to a claim for misfeasance in public office, an important aspect of which is the Council’s stance and what it explained to the school. He would not 10necessarily be able to obtain the information during the court proceedings. 2. Answering the request would finally resolve the matter. Many of the questions could be answered with a yes or no answer. 3. The burden of answering the request was not excessive. Many questions could easily have been answered by providing a copy of the letter of 14 June 2013. Overall the request could have been dealt with in less than an hour. 4. The request would not cause a reasonable person distress. Officers were named to be helpful. 5. Previous information has been put on Mr Matalia’s websites. 6. A question has been repeated because data may have been created since it was first asked. 39. Mr Matalia also makes arguments about s 40(1), but as this is not not relied on by the Council, we do not have to resolve the issue. The ICO’s response 40. The tribunal has considered the response in its entirety but the salient points are as follows. Exposure of misfeasance in public office is of value to the public but there is no evidence of misfeasance. Further: ‘public interest cannot act as a trump card so as to tip the balance against a finding of vexatiousness.’ (CP v Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 0427 (AAC). At [45]). 41. The request and litigation are connected to Mr Matalia’s personal dispute against the school and the Council and the wider course of dealing between the parties. 42. The questions are an attempt to compel the Council to provide opinions and statements for use in Court proceedings rather than recorded information, indicating an inappropriate use of the FOIA. The Court claim is the appropriate means of addressing his allegations. 43. The aggregated burden of dealing with requests related to the school application is oppressive. As a whole Mr Matalia’s conduct presents a picture of unreasonable persistence and obsessive conduct. One of the requests is a repeat request, Mr Matalia has persisted with this appeal despite having received the letter of June 2013 and his concerns have already been addressed by the LGO and the IAP. Responding to this request will likely generate further correspondence and requests. The Public Authority’s response to the appeal (28 June 2018) 44. The tribunal has taken into account the response in its entirety but considers the salient points to be as follows. 1145. Locating the letter of June 2013 in response to this request would have taken an excessive amount of time. If the Council had not relied on s 14 it would have considered applying s 12. The request is not relevant to the misfeasance proceedings. Distress has been caused to Council staff through previous allegations of untruthfulness, racism, corruption, perjury and misfeasance. The current request is therefore likely to cause cause distress. Mr Matalia’s replies 46. The tribunal also notes the points made in Mr Matalia’s replies, and has taken account of them where relevant. Issue 47. The issue we have to determine is whether the Commissioner erred in finding that the CCG was entitled to rely on s 14(1) FOIA. Legal framework S 14(1) Vexatious Request 48. Guidance on applying s 14 is given in the decisions of the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in Dransfield ([2012] UKUT 440 (AAC) and [2015] EWCA Civ 454). The tribunal has adapted the following summary of the principles in Dransfield from the judgment of the Upper Tribunal in CP v Information Commissioner [2016] UKUT 427 (AAC): 49. The Upper Tribunal held that the purpose of section 14 must be to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA (para 10). That formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal subject to the qualification that this was an aim which could only be realised if ‘the high standard set by vexatiousness is satisfied’ (para 72 of the CA judgment). 50. The test under section 14 is whether the request is vexatious not whether the requester is vexatious (para 19). The term ‘vexatious’ in section 14 should carry its ordinary, natural meaning within the particular statutory context of FOIA (para 24). As a starting point, a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may be vexatious but that is not a rule. Annoying or irritating requests are not necessarily vexatious given that one of the main purposes of FOIA is to provide citizens with a qualified right of access to official documentation and thereby a means of holding public authorities to account (para 25). The IC’s guidance that the key question is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation without any proper or justified cause was a useful starting point as long as the emphasis was on the issue of justification (or not). An important part of the balancing exercise may involve consideration of 12whether or not there is an adequate or proper justification for the request (para 26). 51. Four broad issues or themes were identified by the Upper Tribunal as of relevance when deciding whether a request is vexatious. These were: (a) the burden (on the public authority and its staff); (b) the motive (of the requester); (c) the value or serious purpose (of the request); and (d) any harassment or distress (of and to staff). These considerations are not exhaustive and are not intended to create a formulaic check-list. 52. Guidance about the motive of the requester, the value or purpose of the request and harassment of or distress to staff is set out in paragraphs 34-39 of the Upper Tribunal’s decision. 53. As to burden, the context and history of the particular request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether the request is properly to be described as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor [para 29]. Thus, the greater the number of previous FOIA requests that the individual has made to the public authority concerned, the more likely it may be that a further request may properly be found to be vexatious. A requester who consistently submits multiple FOIA requests or associated correspondence within days of each other or who relentlessly bombards the public authority with email traffic is more likely to be found to have made a vexatious request [para 32]. 54. Ultimately the question was whether a request was a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA. Answering that question required a broad, holistic approach which emphasised the attributes of manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there was a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterises vexatious requests [paras 43 and 45]. 55. In the Court of Appeal in Dransfield Arden LJ gave some additional guidance in paragraph 68: ‘In my judgment the Upper Tribunal was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is 13vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the request was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available...’ 56. Nothing in the above paragraph is inconsistent with the Upper Tribunal’s decision which similarly emphasised (a) the need to ensure a holistic approach was taken and (b) that the value of the request was an important but not the only factor. 57. The lack of a reasonable foundation to a request was only the starting point to an analysis which must consider all the relevant circumstances. Public interest cannot act as a ‘trump card’. Rather, the public interest in the subject matter of a request is a consideration that itself needs to be balanced against the resource implications of the request, and any other relevant factors, in a holistic determination of whether a request is vexatious. The role of the tribunal 58. The tribunal’s remit is governed by s.58 FOIA. This requires the tribunal to consider whether the decision made by the Commissioner is in accordance with the law or, where the Commissioner’s decision involved exercising discretion, whether he should have exercised it differently. The Tribunal may receive evidence that was not before the Commissioner, and may make different findings of fact from the Commissioner. Discussion and conclusions Value and purpose of request and motive 59. The Tribunal considers the four factors identified by the Upper Tribunal to be a helpful framework to structure its consideration of whether the request was vexatious but has had regard to the fact that it is not intended to be an exhaustive definition or a checklist for determination of this issue and that a holistic approach must be taken, with no one factor acting as a trump card. 60. We accept that the purpose of the request was to obtain information to support a proposed claim of misfeasance in public office. As set out above at paras 18 and following, the particulars of claim rely heavily on information contained in the letter of 14 June 2013 and the email of 5 July 2013, which we find would have answered a large part of Mr Matalia’s request. This is a separate and additional 14legal challenge to the other avenues pursued in 2014, with the potential for Mr Matalia to receive compensation. It is not a case of Mr Matalia simply trying to revive issues that have already been dealt with. 61. The questions are not simply asking for the Council’s opinion on the legality of the school’s actions, which, it is acknowledged, would not assist a Court. They are intended to elicit the disclosure of recorded information showing the communication of the Council’s opinion on the legality of the school’s proposed actions at the relevant time and the communication of that opinion to the school. The Particulars of Claim show the relevance of this to establishing misfeasance. 62. We do not think that the fact that Mr Matalia might have been able to obtain some or all of the information he has requested by applying to a Court for disclosure makes this an inappropriate use of the FOIA. Mr Matalia has used the information in the letters to draft his initial particulars of claim. We are not in a position to judge whether an application for pre-action disclosure against a non-party would have been successful. 63. We acknowledge that the request is not explicit in asking for recorded information. Some of the request, at first glance, appears to be simply asking for the Council’s opinion. However, Ms Hiller knew that there had been a difference in view between the Council and the school as to the legality of the school’s actions, and she stated that she would have expected there to be correspondence between the Council on the School recording that. The request must be seen in the light of the fact that the Council was aware that there was likely to be a written record of the Council’s opinions at the time in correspondence to the school. We note also the use of the past tense (‘Did WC accept….’ ‘Was it the view of…’) and the repeated references to whether or not the school was informed. Taking all this into account we find that an objective reading of the request in the light of the relevant background information known to the Council would lead to a conclusion that Mr Matalia was, in the main, seeking recorded information of the Council’s view in 2013/2014, and recorded information that showed communication of that view to the school. 64. The request is of clear value to Mr Matalia and we find that his motive in pursuing it was not vengeance or because of a personal grudge. Further we find that the exposure of potential misfeasance in public office is a matter of objective public interest. So too, is the exposure of a school as an admissions authority acting in the face of clear contradictory advice from the Council. We find that the request had an adequate and proper justification. 65. One of the questions is repeated from a previous request. We accept Mr Matalia’s submission that the situation may have changed. The Council could easily indicate if this information is still not held. Two of the questions may relate to information already in Mr Matalia’s possession. This can be stated in 15any response. We do not think that these are significant indicators of this request being vexatious or, taken as a whole, an inappropriate use of FOIA. Harassment and distress 66. We accept that Mr Matalia’s requests cause some stress and annoyance to Council staff. This is not only through the volume of the requests over the entire course of dealings, but also because of Mr Matalia’s tendency to be quick to make allegations of untruthfulness or make threats of police action against individuals. We do not accept that the mentioning of individuals in this request could cause harassment or distress. The request does not use intemperate language, or make allegations of criminal behaviour. Nor could it be described as offensive. We do not find that this request would cause harassment or distress to staff. Burden 67. Although the 11+ requests are on a different topic, we have taken into account the volume and frequency of the 11+ requests, which will necessarily place a burden on the Council’s resources. However, we echo the findings of the previous tribunal in relation to the purpose and public interest in the 11+ information. We accept Mr Matalia’s evidence that some of the information obtained has been published on websites intended to assist parents whose children are sitting the 11+. We have not seen the 11+ requests, but from the very brief summary provided by the Council of each request, there is no evidence before us to suggest that these are anything other than proper requests for information relevant to Mr Matalia’s role as publisher of these websites. 68. In relation to the requests relating to the school admission, we note that what the first-tier tribunal described as a ’barrage’ of requests took place during the period before the matter was heard by the IAP. Thereafter there was a significant period of time (nearly 18 months) before a single request was made on this topic, and then another similar gap before the current request. This is a very different picture to the one before the previous First Tier Tribunal. 69. In relation to the burden of this particular request, we find that many of the answers are contained either in the letter dated 14 June 2013 and email dated 5 July 2013. We heard evidence from Miss Hiller that she would have expected the answers to some of the questions to have been contained in correspondence between the Council and the school. She said that she would have asked the relevant department and they are likely to have given her the hard copy file within which these letters were obtained. She stated that she would also have had to ask officers to carry out email searches to locate relevant information. Whilst we find that the Mr Matalia is unrealistic in expecting the current request to be possible to resolve in less than an hour, we do not think that responding to this request in isolation would have been disproportionately burdensome. 1670. In the light of the history of requests, the Tribunal acknowledges that there is a risk that further FOI requests will be made to the Council by Mr Matalia. We note, however, that Mr Matalia has not been making repeated requests on the school application issue, that this particular request came after an 18 months gap and that it was focussed on information needed to support a particular claim rather than simply reopening the previous issues. This does not suggest a lack of proportionality in relation to this issue. 71. Taken together, we accept that the entire course of dealings with Mr Matalia since 2013 has put a significant burden on the Council. Conclusion 72. Taking all the above into account, we have asked ourselves whether the request was vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of the FOIA. We have taken a holistic and broad approach and have looked at the entire course of dealings. We have considered the number and pattern of requests made on this particular issue, but have also taken account of the burden on the Council from all the requests made by Mr Matalia. We do not think that this is a request that has no reasonable foundation. It is not simply a request for the Council’s opinion. The information requested has value for Mr Matalia and objective public interest. We do not see this as a ‘trump card’, but have balanced it against the resource implications of the request and all the other relevant factors. Taking all this into account, and our detailed findings in the preceding paragraphs, we conclude that the request is not vexatious.

"511","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0069 Decided without a hearing Before JUDGE CARTER ALISON LOWTON ANDREW WHETNALL Between PAMELA LANG Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent and COMPANIES HOUSE Second Respondent DECISION AND REASONS1. This is an appeal by Pamela Lang (“the Appellant”) under s.57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) against the Information Commissioner’s (“the Commissioner”) Decision Notice dated 20 March 2018 (“the DN”). The Appellant had requested information under FOIA from Companies House, the Second Respondent. 2. This appeal is not upheld for the reasons set out in this decision. Background 3. The Appellant is a Director of a leasehold Management Company (""the Company""), a limited company registered at Companies House. The Company was formed by the residents of flats in West London. Until 2012, there were five Directors who were also residents. The Appellant was the Company Secretary. 4. In July 2012, forms were filed electronically at Companies House notifying changes to the personnel of the Company: four of the Directors (including the Appellant) were removed, leaving a single Director, and the Appellant was removed as Company Secretary. All Directors were in fact reinstated a few months later. 5. The Appellant made a request for information. At that point, the Appellant was not formally making a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Thus, on 3 May 2017, the Appellant requested information from Companies House in the following terms: “This is a matter of some importance and full details of who actually submitted the information on both occasions in 2012 is required by the Company, please could you therefore advise which email address was used to electronically file the details. If at all possible, it would be of further help to know a) when the application was first made to register our Company for electronic filing and b) what email address was used when the application was made.” 6. On 16 May 2018 Companies House confirmed that it did not hold the information requested in part (a) and this remains unchallenged. Companies House confirmed, treating this as a request under FOIA, that it held the relevant e-mail address but was withholding it in reliance on s.40(2) FOIA (third party personal data) and s.41 FOIA (information provided in confidence).7. Correspondence followed in which the Appellant continued to seek information otherwise than under FOIA. Companies House explained that as the information requested was not in the public domain, and the Appellant was not entitled to it on any other basis, her request fell to be considered under FOIA. The Tribunal acknowledged that it might have been argued that there was some uncertainty over the scope of the request in that the correspondence gave the impression that she was seeking to ascertain not only the email address and date of application but also the identity of the person who had made the application. The Tribunal’s view was that it should approach the request on the basis that the plain English used which was to the effect that only the email and date were sought. The Appellant’s appeal form only sought the remedy of provision of the email address. 8. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner and, after an investigation, on 28 March 2018, the Commissioner issued the DN, upholding the reliance by Companies House on s.40(2) FOIA. The Commissioner did not go on to consider s.41 FOIA. 9. The Appellant appealed against the DN. The ground of appeal was that that the person who filed the relevant forms did so in the capacity of an officer of the Company, not as a private person, and that this should have a bearing on the correctness of the decision not to disclose. The Law 10. The general right of access to information held by a public authority provided under FOIA is subject to a number of exemptions contained in Part II of FOIA. The s.40(2) exemption is a so-called absolute exemption and applies where disclosure would breach any of the Data Protection Principles (“DPP”) (see below). 11. Section 40 provides an exemption for personal data: “40 Personal information [¦¦] (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and(b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (2) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ""data"" in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. [...]” 12. 'Personal data' is defined in s.l of the Data Protection Act 1998 (""DPA"") as follows: “1 Basic interpretative provisions ""personal data"" means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller [...]” 13. The effect of s.40(2) and (3) FOIA is that personal data will be absolutely exempt where its disclosure would breach any of the DPPs found in Schedule 1 to the DPA. In the present case, the relevant principle is DPP1, which requires that: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met [...]”14. The approach of this Tribunal was to consider whether disclosure of the information requested meets one of the conditions in Schedule 2 and then whether disclosure would be unfair, in terms of the general requirement as to fairness inDPP1. 15. The only relevant condition in Schedule 2 was determined by the Tribunal to be paragraph 6(1): “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 16. In Goldsmith International Business School v IC and Home Office (GIA/1643/2014), the Upper Tribunal endorsed an approach to this condition, which in essence requires three questions to be asked (and a series of propositions which it is not necessary to set out here): (i) Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? (ii) Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? (iii) Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? 17. In deciding whether disclosure of personal data would be unfair in terms of the general requirement as to fairness in DPP1, relevant considerations include the reasonable expectations of the individual as to the ways in which his or her personal data will be processed. This in turn will involve a consideration of what they have been told will happen to their data and their general expectation of privacy, the nature or content of the information itself, the established custom or practice within the public authority and the consequences of disclosing the information (i.e. damage or distress, would the individual suffer if the information was disclosed?). 18. Having assessed the data subjects’ reasonable expectations or any damage or distress caused by disclosure, it may still be fair to disclose the requested information if it can be argued that there is a more compelling legitimate interest in disclosure into the publicdomain (FOIA being disclosure to the world). These interests can include broad general principles of accountability and transparency for their own sake, as well as the legitimate interests pursued by the requester. In balancing these legitimate interests with the rights of the data subject, the public authority, the Commissioner and Tribunal in turn is bound to take a proportionate approach. The Appellant’s evidence and submissions 19. The Appellant argues that the actions of the person who emailed Companies House were fraudulent and thus she and the Company have a strong interest in disclosure. Without the requested information, that is the email address of the person who made the application, she states, the truth will be allowed to remain buried, with the other three directors, new to the Management Company, kept in the dark about the previous irregularities involved in the running of the Company. She has indicated that she is, in addition, seeking the information in order to clear her own name as there is some suggestion that she herself sought the removal. She has tried to obtain the information through seeking her rights as a Company Director and was told by Companies House that these did not apply in these circumstances and nor was this her personal data to which she had a right of access. 20. The Appellant argues that since the individual who emailed Companies House was acting in a professional capacity, this diminishes his expectation of privacy. The Tribunal is invited to conclude that given this the section 40(2) exemption does not apply. 21. The Appellant provided evidence consisting of various Company returns and forms and correspondence between the Appellant, Companies House and the Appellant’s solicitors. Companies House’s evidence and submissions 22.The evidence of Companies House to the Tribunal was to the effect that: a. It is primarily a registry of company information, maintained under provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (""the 2006 Act""). The Registrar of Companies (""the Registrar"") does not conclude on disputes as to factand moreover has no investigative powers under the 2006 Act. b. The 2006 Act requires companies to keep registers of certain information, including the names of Directors and, where appropriate, Secretaries. Any changes to the register must be notified to Companies House using an appropriate form, although the change takes legal effect when made to the company's register, not when notified to Companies House; c. Forms may be filed by a person authorised by the relevant company to do so. An authentication code is sent to the e-mail address of the authorised person, and anyone with access to the e-mail address and the authentication code is then able to file forms on the company's behalf. There is in addition a security password. d. Documents filed using the Companies House electronic filing system are in the public domain, but the e-mail address used to file them is not. It was argued that disclosure of such e-mail addresses is prohibited by s.1087(1) of the 2006 Act, which provides that: “1087 Material not available for public inspection (3) The following material must not be made available by the Registrar for public inspection: (i) any e-mail address, identification code or password deriving from a document delivered for the purpose of authorising or facilitating electronic filing procedures or providing information by telephone [...]”. 23. Companies House argue that disclosure of the requested information would breach DPP1, it not being within the reasonable expectation of the sender of the email that their personal data would be disclosed further to this FOIA request and that there is a risk of identity fraud if such information were to be given out. In these circumstances, and given that the Appellant has not, it is argued, substantiated the offence of fraud, the absolute exemption in section 40(2) applies.The Commissioner’s submissions 24. Although the Appellant does not spell out the legal consequences of the ground of appeal, the Commissioner, in its submissions to the Tribunal, considered two possibilities: a. That the information is not personal data at all; alternatively b. Although the information is personal data, the data subject's legitimate expectations of privacy are much lower than if s/he had been acting in a private capacity, and are outweighed by the Appellant's legitimate interests in knowing the information. 25. The Commissioner invites the Tribunal to find that the individual who filed the relevant forms can be identified from the e-mail address, both by Companies House and by the Appellant herself, by combining it with other information that they hold about the data subject. That brings it within the definition of personal data given in s.l DPA (see above), which does not expressly differentiate between information relating to an individual's official or public roles, and the individual's private life. 26. The capacity in which the individual is acting is relevant only to the strength of the interests for and against disclosure. Whilst as a general principle, individuals will have a less strong expectation of privacy in relation to information arising from their professional lives than they do about information relating to their private lives, this does not mean that information about professional activities will always fall to be disclosed. Thus, here, where the activity is on behalf of a private company with a direct link to the data subject’s residency, there may still be a significant expectation of privacy. Thus, even if the filing of the forms was technically carried out on behalf of a corporate entity, it was an action that was very closely linked to the individual's private life. 27. The Commissioner argued that it would be unfair to the data subject to disclose the e-mail address, in particular given that: a. It is clear to any user of Companies House register that the identity of the person providing information to the Registrar does not form part of the public record; b. The statutory provision expressly prohibiting the Registrar from making this information available for inspection should form part of the reasonable expectation of the data subject;c. Any user of a Government service would have a strong expectation that none of the information used to log in to that service would be disclosed to the world at large under FOIA; there are obvious security reasons not to disclose even partial log-in credentials; and d. Disclosure would in fact put the data subject at risk of identity fraud and hacking. Decision 28. The Tribunal was satisfied that the requested information was the personal data of the person who made the application for the removal of the Directors including the Appellant from the register. It allowed for identification of the data subject both by Companies House and by the Appellant herself, by combining it with other information that they hold about the data subject. 29. The ground of appeal was essentially that in considering whether there would be a breach of the DPPs, the Tribunal should give considerable weight to the fact that the data subject was purporting to act on behalf of the Company and therefore not in a private capacity. The Tribunal was of the view that the Company being a leasehold company meant that, whilst the sender of the email was indeed acting in a business related capacity, there was a strong link to his private life, through his private residence. As such, taken alongside the fact that users of the secure Companies House system would assume (particularly given the statutory provision in the 2006 Act and the use of the authentication code) that this would not routinely be disclosed, the Tribunal was satisfied that, on the assumption that the changes in registration were honestly made, it would have been the data subject’s reasonable expectation that there would not be disclosure. Given the lack of evidence from sources other than the Appellant and Companies House, and a lack of evidence as to dishonest intent, the Tribunal was unable to form any view as to the motives of the person requesting the changes. As such, it did not consider it appropriate to proceed on any basis other than that that person was acting honestly. The Tribunal also took into account the potential implications for misuse of private information were such email addresses to be routinely disclosed. 30. The Tribunal accepted that the Appellant had a legitimate interest in receiving the email address of the person who had applied to Companies House to have her and the other Directors removed from the register. This amounted to an amendment to her own personal data as held by Companies House. That said, the Appellant had not produced evidence of certain elements of the offence of fraud having been committed (that offence including as it does an element of intent to cause gain or loss and knowledge that a representation is or maybe untrue or misleading). Whilst it was clear that the Directors hadbeen removed (and she had been removed as Company Secretary), the Tribunal was not in a position to ascertain whether this had been further to a dishonest act. It accepted moreover that it was not Companies House role to investigate and determine private disputes. 31. Nevertheless, the Tribunal acknowledged that the Appellant clearly considered there to have been an irregularity and that this had given rise to difficulties in relation to the operation of the company. As such, she had sought disclosure of the identity of the person seeking removal from Companies House register further to her rights as a director. Companies House had refused this and also refuted the idea that this information was the Appellant’s personal data. As such, the Tribunal further accepted that insofar as the Appellant had a legitimate interest in this information it was also necessary for her to seek disclosure further to FOIA. It did not appear that there was any other clear route for her to take, Companies House in fact insisting that her request had to be dealt with under FOIA. Thus, the first two limbs of the test for paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 DPA were met (see paragraph 16 above). This led then to the balancing of the Appellant’s legitimate interest as against those of the data subject, and only in circumstances in which the former outweighed any prejudice to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, would disclosure be lawful. 32. In this appeal, the balancing act for both the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 and the general requirements as to fairness in DPP1 required the same considerations. The Tribunal carefully considered this equation as it recognised that the Appellant (as noted above) needed to pursue this avenue if she was to obtain proof as to the identity of the person who had sought the changes the register and this clearly had been of material concern to her. If there had been conclusive evidence of the changes to the register having been made with dishonest intent, this would have increased the legitimate interests of the Appellant. However, neither the Tribunal nor the Commissioner were in a position to investigate or make a determination on this issue, as this went beyond the jurisdiction of FOIA. There did not appear to be any wider public interest in disclosure beyond the general interests of accountability and transparency. 33. The Tribunal ultimately decided that the interests of the Appellant and those in favour of disclosure, viewed in this way, were outweighed by the potential prejudice to the data subject (the person identified in the requested email address) in the context in which it was clear that that person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy. There was potential prejudice that could arise from disclosure given the indications of an underlying dispute and also the wider risk of identity theft if email addresses connected with companieswere to be disclosed. Unlike the application of the other exemptions under FOIA, in relation to section 40 there was no presumption in favour of disclosure, precisely because of the public interest accorded to the protection of the privacy of individual data subjects. In these circumstances, the Tribunal was satisfied that disclosure would be in breach of DPP1 in terms of the general requirement as to fairness and also in that no condition under Schedule 2 was met. As such, Companies House and the Commissioner in turn had been correct in concluding that the exemption in section 40(2) applied. 34. Finally, whilst it was not clear that for Companies House to disclose the requested information would be a breach of section 1087 (see above), as that related to the contents of Companies House register itself, the Tribunal could appreciate that it was important for Companies House to remain neutral in the absence of some compelling evidence of fraud or where it was subject to a legal compulsion to disclose. Companies House had sought to suggest that by reason of a potential breach of section 1087, section 44 FOIA would have applied. Given however the Tribunal’s view that section 40(2) did mean that the information should not be disclosed, it did not come to a view on this matter. Nor did the Tribunal consider the application of section 41 FOIA in relation to this matter, as it had concluded that the exemption at section 40(2) did apply. 35. For the reasons above, the Tribunal unanimously dismissed the Appeal. Signed Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 19 October 2018 Promulgation date: 22 October 2018"
"571","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0070 Before Judge Stephen Cragg Q.C. Tribunal Members Mr Gareth Jones and Mr Paul Taylor Between Steven Singleton Appellant And The Information Commissioner Respondent Sitting at Nottingham Civil Justice Centre on 24 August 2018 Representation: The Appellant appeared in person The Commissioner was not represented 1DECISION AND REASONS BACKGROUND 1. The Appellant requested information from the Two Counties Trust (the Trust) on 7 September 2017, which materially read as follows:- “…. According to the Academies Financial Handbook 2017, issued by the Education & Skills Funding Agency, ‘special payments’ are transactions that fall outside of the The Two Counties Trusts’ [the Trust] planned range of activities. They are either non-statutory or non-contractual and so are subject to greater control than other payments. In particular I am interested in those special payments that specifically fall into a number of defined categories which have been made by [the Trust] relating to the Manor Academy…during the period 1st October 2016- 31st August 2017 (inclusive). 2. In an appendix the Appellant listed the categories he was interested in, and these all included payments to staff during this period: redundancy payments, compensation payments, ex gratia, voluntary exit and severance payments, discretionary payments ‘to buy out actuarial reductions in staff pensions’, and payments made in lieu of notice. He also sought the ‘grand total’ of special payments in this period. In each category he sought the total number of employees in receipt of a special payment by type, the total value of employee special payments by type, and the total number of such special payments approved by the Education & Skills Funding agency/HM Treasury (because delegated levels had been exceeded). 3. Most of the information was provided by the Trust on 8 September 2017, but it declined to provide the number and value of ex gratia, voluntary exit and special severance payments and payments in lieu of service. 2Following a review, the Trust upheld its decision and confirmed that the withheld information related to one individual and relied on s40(2) FOIA as the reason for withholding the information. 4. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who issued a decision notice dated 27 March 2018, which upheld the reliance on section 40(2) FOIA. In the Commissioner’s view, the information requested is personal data, despite being anonymised, as it could lead to the individual being identified, and it would not be fair to disclose the information as the individual has not consented to its release, and would have a reasonable expectation that the information would not be released. The Commissioner recognised that there may be concerns about the special payments made by the Trust, and how it is categorised the payments in audited accounts, but these do not outweigh the legitimate interests of the individual. 5. The Appellant filed an appeal dated 2 April 2018. He explains that he seeks the information requested because of his concerns about the number of payments made by the Trust at the Manor Academy school ‘designed to circumvent a number of conduct, capability and staff grievance issues’. He is particularly interested in ‘a large payout of public money’ to one senior member of staff. He points out that the Academies Financial Handbook 2017 (the financial handbook) issued by the Education & Skills Funding Agency (the Agency) in July 2017 has provisions which state that ‘Staff severance payments should not be made where they could be seen as a reward for failure’ (see para 3.7.5 of the financial handbook). 6. He notes that the financial handbook states that academy trusts ‘must disclose aggregate figures for transactions of any amount, and separate disclosure for individual transactions above £5,000, in their audited accounts’ for a list of transactions which include ‘special payments - compensation’ and ‘special payments – ex gratia’ (para 3.1.8) and that para 33.1.9 of the financial handbook states that ‘special payments – staff severance’ must be disclosed in total and individually. He says that the information should have been disclosed in published accounts (but it has not been so published) and therefore he is simply requesting information that should have been published elsewhere. He disagrees with the Trust’s submission to the Commissioner that any information published in accounts would have been presented in a way that would not have revealed the identity of the individual. On this basis he argues that the public interest in disclosure should outweigh the interests of a senior member of staff. He makes it clear that he is seeking the disclosure of the value of the ex gratia payment made to the senior member of staff. 7. In the hearing, the Appellant emphasised these points about the accountancy shortcomings of the Trust and the importance of having all the requested information to reveal what has happened. We can see the force in what he says, and note that in the decision notice the Commissioner has recorded that the Trust ‘considered that its auditors may have made an error in not reporting the ‘special payments’ in the year, in the last set out accounts’ (paragraph 46). The Commissioner thought it unlikely that, if and when the information is published, this will be in such a way as to reveal any individual’s personal data. The Commissioner also revealed in the decision notice at paragraph 54 that the payment about which information has been withheld is to only one person and is ‘well below the £50,000 authorisation threshold for severance and compensation payments’ (paragraph 54). LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND APPLICATION 8. Section 40 FOIA reads, materially, as follows:- 440.— Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or (ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (4) The second condition is that by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(c) of that Act (data subject's right of access to personal data). 9. The Appellant has not disputed that the payment amounts that have been withheld are ‘personal information’ on the basis that the one individual to whom the payments relate would be likely to be identifiable if the amounts are disclosed. 10. Consideration has to be given under s40(3)(a)(i) and (ii) as to whether that personal data can be disclosed without contravention of data protection principles. 11. Materially, for the purposes of s40(3)(a)(i), the first data protection principle requires that personal data is processed (which includes 5disclosure) fairly. Section 10 of the DPA 1998 (as referred to in s40(3)(a)(ii)) refers to damage or distress caused by disclosure. 12. In relation to interpreting the first principle, the disclosure must also not breach the material conditions in Sch 2 to the DPA 1998 ‘relevant for purposes of the first principle’. Processing is permitted if the data subject has consented to it (Sch 2, first condition), but if not then for the purposes of the sixth condition in Sch 2 it must be established that the disclosure is necessary in order to meet the legitimate interests of the appellant. 13. Further for the purposes of the sixth condition, there is an exception to disclosure even where disclosure has been established as for the purposes of the appellant’s legitimate interests. Thus, the exception covers a situation where the processing (disclosure) is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. DISCUSSION AND DECISION 14. Distilling the requirements of s40 FOIA, in deciding whether disclosure is fair, the Commissioner has noted the following in her Response: (a) the reasonable expectation of the data subject in relation to disclosure will be considered along with any consequences of disclosure; (b) whether there is a legitimate public interest in disclosure notwithstanding the two considerations in (a). 15. We understand (as did the Commissioner) why the appellant says he has a legitimate interest in the disclosure of these payment amounts. It is important that public authorities comply with guidance in relation to their accounts and it appears, by their own admission to the Commissioner, that the Trust in this instance may not have complied with the guidance. 6However, the individual concerned (even though a senior member of staff) would have a strong expectation that details of payments would not have been disclosed, and this expectation must continue. If there is disclosure then it is accepted that it will be possible to calculate the amount paid to the individual which is bound to cause distress to the individual if this is reported, either widely or locally. 16. The Appellant is concerned about ‘a large payout of public money’, but in fact he now knows that the amount involved was ‘well below £50,000’ (see above). The Appellant also accepted that he had other avenues through which he could pursue the alleged financial irregularities and his appeal form states that he is ‘seeking referral to the regulatory bodies that oversee Academy Trust sector (The Department for Education and the Charity Commission)’. It seems to us that the regulatory bodies are likely to be the appropriate route for the Appellant to pursue these issues further. 17. Therefore we find:- (a) The payment amount figures sought (and the grand total amount which would enable the Appellant to calculate these figures) are personal data. (b) There is a legitimate interest in having the full picture of the amounts paid, given the concerns that errors have been made in reporting ‘special payments’. (c) But disclosure is not necessary for the purposes of those legitimate interests, because the disclosure is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights of the data subject as described above. (d) Processing the information by way of disclosure would not meet the requirement of fairness. 7CONCLUSION 18. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that that Trust were entitled to rely on s40(2) FOIA to withhold the information and the appeal is dismissed. 19. This decision is unanimous.

"62","EIR","First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2018/0028 Decided without a hearing On 10 July 2018 Before JUDGE HAZEL OLIVER MRS SUZANNE COSGRAVE MS ALISON LOWTON Between MR ROD COOKE Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION The appeal is dismissed. REASONS Background to Appeal 1. This appeal is against a decision of the Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) dated 8 February 2018. It concerns information sought in relation to meeting minutes of Kirby Cane & Ellingham Parish Council (the “Council”). 2. The parties opted for paper determination of the appeal. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended).3. The appellant has an ongoing dispute with the Council about the ownership of certain land which was given to the community prior to 1894 for the relief of the poor. This land is managed by groups of volunteer resident trustees and is vested in the Charity Commission. The appellant contends that the land is actually owned by the Council, and that land is being held and managed improperly. 4. On 9 February 2017 the appellant made two separate requests for information from the Council, in relation to item 18 of the minutes of its meeting on 15 November 2016. Item 18 was about consideration of correspondence relating to local charities, and set out a summary of advice received from a solicitor about ownership of the land and the handling of further correspondence on the matter. a. “I am now asking via the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of the correspondence, email or otherwise, between the Clerk, Chair and other councillors concerning Item 18 from below the minutes of the November 15th 2016 meeting. I am also asking for full details of councillors present for Item 18, those who took part in discussions, what dispensations were asked for and given and what interests were declared”. b. “Owing to the absurdity of the above statements, I am now asking via the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of the correspondence, email or otherwise, between the Clerk, Chair and the NP Law solicitor; or, copies of minutes taken, or notes made, during face to face meetings, or telephone conversations with the NP Law solicitor. Also copies of any memos, emails, or other communications between the Clerk and the Chair, other councillors. I also wish to have the reference from NP Law so that I, or my legal representative, can contact them”. 5. The Council responded to these requests on 8 March 2017. They refused to provide the information in reliance on section 14 of FOIA, on the grounds that “these items are vexatious and are substantially repeat requests as they relate to issues which have frequently been dealt with by [the Council] in the past”. 6. The appellant requested an independent internal review of this decision on 20 March 2017. The Council provided its review decision on 19 April 2017, and upheld the original decision to withhold the information. The appellant made a complaint to the Commissioner on 24 April 2017. 7. The Commissioner issued her Decision Notice on 8 February 2018. The Commissioner decided that section 14(1) (vexatious requests) was engaged in relation to both of the requests. The Council would be placed under an unjustified and disproportionate burden if it had to respond to the requests. The Appeal 8. The appellant appealed against the Commissioner’s decision on 16 February 2018. The appeal is put on the basis that the requests cannot be regarded as “vexatious” as they were only made after the November 2016 meeting, and councillors could be seen as trying to mislead the public and protect themselves from being reported by withholding the information. In relation to the first request, the appellant says it is illegal for councillors not to declare an interest. In relation to the second request, the appellant says he has provided conclusive evidence that theCouncil did own the relevant land and has asked for the legal advice to be made public. He alleges that the Council should not be allowed to continue what looks like an attempt to cover up wrongdoings. He also takes issue with the accuracy of much of the information provided by the Council to the Commissioner. 9. The Commissioner’s response maintains that the requests are vexatious, adopting a holistic approach and considering the motive, value, burden and previous course of dealings between the appellant and the Council. The appellant has provided a response to this document which explains his disagreement with the points relied on by the Commissioner, and a final submission relating to caselaw on ownership of land. Applicable law 10. The relevant provisions of FOIA are as follows. 1 General right of access to information held by public authorities. (1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled— (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. …… 14 Vexatious or repeated requests. (1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious. 11. There is no further guidance on the meaning of “vexatious” in the legislation. The leading guidance is contained in the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) decision in Information Commissioner v Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC), as upheld and clarified in the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in Dransfield v Information Commissioner and another & Craven v Information Commissioner and another [2015] EWCA Civ 454 (CA). 12. As noted by Arden LJ in her judgment in the CA in Dransfield, the hurdle of showing a request is vexatious is a high one: “…the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious.” (para 68). 13. Judge Wikeley’s decision in the UT Dransfield sets out more detailed guidance that was not challenged in the CA. The ultimate question is, “is the request vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA?” (para 43). It is important to adopt a “holistic and broad” approach, emphasising “manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there is a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterise vexatious requests.” (para 45). Arden LJ in the CA also emphasised that a “rounded approach” is required (para 69), and all evidence which may shed light on whether a request is vexatious should be considered.14. The UT set out four non-exhaustive broad issues which can be helpful in assessing whether a request is vexatious: a. The burden imposed on the public authority by the request. This may be inextricably linked with the previous course of dealings between the parties. “…the context and history of the previous request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor.” (para 29). b. The motive of the requester. Although FOIA is motive-blind, “what may seem like an entirely reasonable and benign request may be found to be vexatious in the wider context of the course of dealings between the individual and the relevant public authority.” (para 34). c. The value or serious purpose. Lack of objective value cannot provide a basis for refusal on its own, but is part of the balancing exercise – “does the request have a value or serious purpose in terms of the objective public interest in the information sought?” (para 38). d. Any harassment of, or distress caused to, the public authority’s staff. This is not necessary in order for a request to be vexatious, but “vexatiousness may be evidenced by obsessive conduct that harasses or distresses staff, uses intemperate language, makes side-ranging and unsubstantiated allegations of criminal behaviour or is in any other respects extremely offensive.” (para 39). 15. Overall, the purpose of section 14 is to “protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA.” (UT para 10), subject always to the high standard of vexatiousness being met. Evidence and submissions 16. We had an agreed bundle of open documents, including the final response and submissions from the appellant, which we read. We have taken all of this material into account in making our decision. Discussion and Conclusions 17. We have considered whether these requests were vexatious in accordance with the broad headings set out by the UT in Dransfield. 18. The burden imposed on the public authority by the request. The appellant makes the point that the burden of his request is minimal, as all the information is easily at hand for the clerk. However, this must be considered in the context of the previous course of dealings between the parties. A simple request may nevertheless be vexatious when considered in the round.19. The appellant’s requests are clearly very closely connected with a long-running dispute between him and the Council about ownership of certain land, going back over six years. This has generated considerable correspondence, to be dealt with by a single part-time clerk and eight volunteer parish councillors. The Council has said to the Commissioner that the appellant sent 215 emails to the present clerk between 2014 and October 2017, and it can take up to five hours a month to deal with the correspondence. The appellant says there is “no evidence” for the number of emails, but does not deny that this has been a long-running matter. This has included a standards and conduct investigation in 2013 in relation to complaints about the appellant’s conduct, and an investigation by the auditors Mazars LLP in December 2014 following the appellant’s objection to the Council’s accounts. The ongoing dispute and volume of correspondence also indicates that a response to the current requests is very likely to generate further correspondence. 20. Taking into account the history of this matter, including the small size of the Council which is run by part-time volunteers, we find that a significant burden would be imposed on the public authority by the requests. 21. The motive of the requester. The appellant says that his motives are to ensure that the Council complies with the law in relation to provision of information in the public domain and the Nolan Principles. He says that the Council should not be allowed to continue with what looks like an attempt to cover up wrong-doings. In relation to his request about the legal advice, he says that he has provided conclusive evidence that the Council does own the lands in question. 22. Again, this must be looked at in the wider context of the course of dealings between the parties. It is clear that both of the requests are very closely connected with the dispute about ownership of land. The request about legal advice is self-evidently about this issue. The request about item 18 in the minutes is put by the appellant as a concern about wrongdoing, but again this directly concerns a discussion item about the land ownership. In context, we find that the motive of the appellant in making these requests was primarily connected with this ongoing dispute rather than for any wider purpose in the public interest. 23. The value or serious purpose of the requests. As already noted above, the appellant says these relate to very serious concerns that the council has not complied with the law. The legal advice in question relates to land and assets approaching one million pounds, so the public are entitled to see exactly what the solicitor did or did not say. The appellant also disputes a number of the matters relied on by the Commissioner, including that the Charity Commission will not correspond with him and that he made a complaint to the police. 24. We do accept that transparency in the operation of parish councils is an important principle in the public interest, as is ensuring that such councils operate within the law. We are also not in a position to make a finding on the factual points disputed by the appellant, and it is not our role to make a finding on whether the legal advice received by the Council was correct. However, as noted above, this is a long-running matter which has already been considered in detail between the parties over a number of years. 25. We agree with the Commissioner that the minutes already set out a summary of the Council’s position regarding the legal advice on land ownership, which provides the public with some information and reduces the value in disclosure of the information requested. In addition, in December 2014 there was a letter to the appellant from the auditors Mazars LLP which hadalready considered the appellant’s complaints about the Council’s approach to the relevant charities, and found no failure of governance or other concerns that would justify issuing a report in the public interest – including a finding that it was not unreasonable for the Council to make no further enquiries to assert tittle to assets. We also note that the appellant has not provided any evidence to support his allegations of wrongdoing. His assertions that the Council’s position on the land ownership is incorrect does not indicate wrongdoing – this is a disagreement between the parties. These factors limit the value and serious purpose of the request. 26. Any harassment of, or distress caused to, the public authority’s staff. We do not find that the appellant has deliberately harassed or caused distress to the Council members or clerk. Nonetheless, we note that there has been a considerable volume of correspondence over a number of years directed at a single issue. In the context of a small council run by volunteers and a part time clerk, we find that the burden of dealing with this matter would potentially cause a feeling of harassment and distress to the individuals involved. 27. Considering all of the above matters, we find that these requests do reach the high standard of vexatiousness. We have considered the purpose of section 14 as being to protect the resources of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA. These requests were directly connected with a long-running dispute between the appellant and the Council, which the Council had already spent very considerable time and resources on dealing with. There is no reason to think that a response to these requests would have been the end of the matter, and in fact were likely to generate further correspondence or requests. Looked at in the round, it would be disproportionate to require the Council to respond to these requests and we find that they are vexatious. 28. We uphold the decision of the Information Commissioner and dismiss the appeal. Signed: Hazel Oliver Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 20 July 2018 Promulgation date: 23 July 2018"
"66","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0158 Heard at Cardiff Civil and Family Justice Centre On 9 March 2017 Before CHRIS RYAN JUDGE SUZANNE COSGRAVE PAUL TAYLOR TRIBUNAL MEMBERS Between ANDREW HOVORD Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS Attendances: The Appellant attended the hearing The Information Commissioner did not attend and was not representedIN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2017/0158 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeal is dismissed REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. We have decided that the Information Commissioner was correct in concluding that Cardiff Council (“the Council”) would have been entitled to neither confirm nor deny that it held certain information requested by the Appellant. The basis of that decision is that any other response breached the data protection principles, as they apply to the individual to which the information referred. The request for information 2. On 9 September 2016 the Appellant sent the Council a request for information in the following terms: “Under the Freedom of Information Act could you supply me with the number of tickets that have been issued to the vehicle registration numbers below from the 01/01/16 please?” Two registration numbers then followed. One was for a van and the other a car. 3. FOIA section 1 imposes on the public authorities to whom it applies an obligation to inform a person requesting information whether it holds the requested information. If it does, then it should communicate the information to him or her unless certain conditions apply or the information is exempt from disclosure. The relevant part of section 1 reads: “(1) Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled- (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. … (6) In this Act, the duty of a public authority to comply with subsection (1)(a) is referred to as ‘the duty to confirm or deny’” 4. The Council refused to disclose the requested information on the basis that doing so would involve the disclosure of the personal data of the registered keeper of eachvehicle and it was therefore exempt information under FOIA section 40(2). The Council maintained that stance during the initial stage of an investigation carried out by the Information Commissioner at the request of the Appellant. However, it ultimately discovered that the owner of the van was not an individual but a company. No question of personal data could therefore arise in relation to it and that part of the requested information was immediately disclosed to the Appellant. The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice 5. At the end of her investigation into the Council’s treatment of the rest of the information request, the Information Commissioner issued a decision notice (FS50651941 of 22 June 2017) in which she determined that the Council had been entitled to refuse to disclose the information requested. However, she went further and ruled that the Council should, in fact, not even have indicated whether or not it held any relevant information. It should have exercised its right to “neither confirm nor deny”. Conceding that it held information within the scope of the information request had the effect of disclosing that the registered owner had received one or more penalty tickets in respect of the vehicle. That fact was part of that individual’s personal data. 6. The relevant part of FOIA section 40 reads: “40 Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a)it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b)either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a)in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i)any of the data protection principles, or (ii)section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b )in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded.(4)The second condition is that by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(c) of that Act (data subject’s right of access to personal data). (5)The duty to confirm or deny— (a)does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b)does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 or would do so if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of that Act were disregarded, or (ii) by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(a) of that Act (data subject’s right to be informed whether personal data being processed). 7. The Information Commissioner decided, first, that it was possible to identify an individual from a registered vehicle’s number plate. This was based on the definition of “personal data” set out in section 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). It provides: “’personal data’ means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified- (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller” 8. Information that a penalty notice had been issued against an individual’s vehicle was taken to be information that related to that individual. The test then applied by the Information Commissioner, in order to determine whether the individual would be identifiable, was to ask whether a member of the public, provided with the requested information and applying a degree of determination, could have established who had been penalised. If the chance of that happening was, in the words of the Information Commissioner, “above a hypothetical possibility” in the circumstances under consideration, then that would be sufficient to establish that the requested information did constitute personal data. 9. The second part of the test that the Information Commissioner set was whether confirming or denying that the information was held would breach the data protection principles (as set out in Schedule 2 to the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”)). She focused on the first principle which reads: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully, and in particular shall not be processed unless-(a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met …” It is common ground on this Appeal that the relevant Schedule 2 condition is paragraph 6 which reads, in relevant part: “6(1). The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” 10. The Information Commissioner decided that confirming or denying the information request would not be “fair”. The registered keeper would have been entitled to expect privacy in respect of his or her ownership of the vehicle and whether any penalty tickets had been issued in respect of it. They would have a reasonable expectation that they would not be exposed to a “name and shame” disclosure. Those factors outweighed the public interest in transparency and accountability of public sector organisations, such as the Council, in the performance of its enforcement activities. 11. The Information Commissioner concluded her decision in these terms: “In light of the nature of the information, the reasonable expectations of the data subject and the consequences of disclosure, the Commissioner is satisfied that confirming or denying if the requested information is held could potentially cause unnecessary and unjustified distress to the data subject. She considers that these arguments outweigh any legitimate interest in disclosure. She has therefore decided that confirmation or denial in this case would breach the first data protection principle and finds the exemption at section 40(5) is engaged and the duty to confirm or deny does not arise” The Appeal to this Tribunal 12. On 31 July 2017 the Appellant submitted an appeal against the decision notice to this Tribunal. It was out of time but an extension of time was granted. 13. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, she ought to have exercised her discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 14. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal included several complaints about the way in which the Information Commissioner had conducted her investigation, but the principle grounds were based on two arguments. First, the Appellant challenged the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that personal data was involved. He argued that it was not possible to identify any individual from information about the number of times penalty tickets had been issued in respect of an inanimate object. Secondly, the Appellant argued that, as the vehicle owner had committed an offence (by parking illegally on, the Appellant said, “over 100 occasions”), the data protection principles ought not to protect them, in any event, from disclosure of that fact. His legitimate interest in knowing whether traffic wardens in the area had been doing their job or just ignoring his complaints should have prevailed.15. The Information Commissioner filed a Response to the Appeal. She argued that confirmation or denial would reveal to the World (not just the Appellant) that one or more penalty tickets had been issued against the individual who was registered as the keeper of the vehicle in question. And if one or more members of the public were able then to identify that individual they would have come into possession of his or her personal data. As to the Appellant’s second argument, the Information Commissioner argued that she had been correct to conclude in her Decision Notice that the registered keeper had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in respect of any parking fines issued against him or her. The Appellant’s concerns about illegal parking and the Council’s reaction to it did not give rise to a public interest in disclosure that carried sufficient weight to justify overriding that expectation. 16. The Appellant asked that his appeal be determined following a hearing, as he was entitled to do. However, the Information Commissioner indicated that she did not intend to be represented at the hearing. We have therefore reached our decision on the basis of the Appellant’s oral submissions at the hearing, considered alongside the parties’ written submissions and an agreed bundle of relevant materials. Our determination 17. The fact that an individual has had one or more penalty tickets issued against a vehicle of which he or she is the registered keeper constitutes that individual’s personal data. It is biographical information about him or her. As to the Appellant’s argument that the withheld information related only to an inanimate object, not an individual, there is a strong likelihood that members of the public, if informed that parking tickets had been issued in respect of a particular vehicle would, immediately or with minimum further enquiry, complete the connection with the registered keeper. We therefore reject the Appellant’s first argument. 18. As indicated above the Information Commissioner approached the Appellant’s second argument by assessing whether disclosure would be fair. Having decided that it would not she did not consider whether or not disclosure would have satisfied the relevant Schedule 2 test – as set out in paragraph 9 above. 19. We prefer to adopt the approach, approved by the Upper Tribunal in Farrand v Information Commissioner and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority [2014] UKUT 0310 (AAC), of considering, first, whether disclosure would satisfy the test set out in Schedule 2. 20. Guidance on the proper approach to adopt in relation to paragraph 6(1) of that Schedule is to be found in the Upper Tribunal decision in Information Commissioner v (1) CF and (2) Nursing and Midwifery Council [2015] UKUT 449 (AAC). At paragraph 19 of that decision Judge Jacob said: “19. The application of paragraph 6(1) is often referred to as involving a balance. I prefer not to use that language, as it is potentially misleading. Any balance involved is different from the balance that has to be applied under, for example, section 2(1)(b) of FOIA. As I said of paragraph 6(1) in Farrand v the Information Commissioner and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority [2014] UKUT 310 (AAC):29. … It contains a condition that must be satisfied – that processing is necessary – to which there is an exception – prejudice to the data subject. … … Applying paragraph 6(1) may involve up to three stages: · The first stage is to consider whether the processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data would be disclosed. If not, it is not necessary to proceed to the other stages. That is what I decided in Farrand at [29]. · The second stage only arises if the consideration passes the first stage. It is then necessary to identify the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. If there are none, it is not necessary to proceed to the third stage. · The third stage only arises if the consideration passes the first and second stages. It is then necessary to consider whether the processing is unwarranted, or overridden, in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the data subject’s rights, freedoms or legitimate interests.” 21. In the present case the Appellant explained to us during the hearing his concern, both personally and as a member of the public paying council tax, about what he saw as lax enforcement by the Council of its own rules on illegal parking. Without entering a debate as to whether the “legitimate interest” under the first stage of the analysis must be a private or a public interest, we are satisfied that the Appellant did have a legitimate interest in pursuing his information request. 22. Turning to Upper Tribunal Judge Jacob’s second stage, we consider that the Information Commissioner was right to conclude that confirmation or denial would interfere with the rights and freedoms of the registered keeper of the vehicle in question. He or she would have a reasonable expectation that the receipt of one or more parking tickets would remain private, just as a private citizen would in respect of a failure to pay council tax – see the Upper Tribunal decision of DH v (1) Information Commissioner, (2) Bolton Council1. Upper Tribunal Judge Marcus made it clear in that case that it was only the role of the data subject as a local councillor which justified disclosure. 23. The Bolton Council decision also provides valuable guidance for the third stage of our analysis, in that it makes it clear that the element of disapproval that may attach to an individual’s failure to comply with elements of his or her obligations to fellow citizens does not, on its own, justify the relevant data processing – it will remain an “unwarranted” interference with privacy unless outweighed by one or more other factors that make the interference “necessary” to serve an identified interest. We do not consider that the Appellant’s concerns, understandable and genuinely felt as they clearly are, carry sufficient weight to tip the balance in favour of the degree of disclosure that would follow a confirmation or denial of the existence of the requested information. 24. In these circumstances we consider that the Information Commissioner was correct to conclude that the Council should have issued a “neither confirm nor deny” response to the information request, although we reach that conclusion by a slightly different route. 25. Our decision is unanimous. 1 [2016] UKUT 0139 (AAC) at paragraphs 39 and 40Signed Judge Chris Ryan Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date: 11 July 2018"
"70","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0271 Decided without a hearing on 2nd June 2018 Before KAREN BOOTH JUDGE PAUL TAYLOR and JEAN NELSON TRIBUNAL MEMBER(S) Between EWA SYGULSKA Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS 1DECISION 1. The appeal is allowed in part. The Respondent’s decision notice dated 19 October 2017 is not fully in accordance with the law. The Tribunal substitutes the following decision notice in its place: I. Other than as specified in paragraph II, the MOD has correctly applied section 40(2) to the information in the service record of the individual to whom the request for information applied. II. Section 40(2) of FOIA does not apply to the following information: i. The information in the communication dated 14 July 1947 at page 3 of the closed bundle of documents (other than all information relating to the recipient of that communication, which must be redacted). ii. The information in the communication dated 20 September 1948 at page 5 of the closed bundle (other than the two words immediately following the word “commission” [sic] in the first paragraph of that communication, which must be redacted). That information must be disclosed to the Appellant within 35 days. 2. For the avoidance of doubt, the information to be disclosed (with the required redactions) is appended to Annex 2 to this decision, which is closed (pursuant to rule 14(6) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009) pending any application for permission to appeal and, if such application is received, until any application and resultant proceedings have concluded. REASONS The background 3. The Appellant is the niece of a Polish national (“JB”), who was commissioned in the Polish Resettlement Corps and served as a Captain in the British army from 1943. The Appellant has produced evidence that indicates that JB took leave of absence from the army in May 1947, when he returned to Poland with the intention of rescuing his fiancée and cousin from Poland and bringing them to the West. The plan went awry and JB was arrested close to the Polish/German border. The Polish authorities maintain that he was released from temporary arrest in August 1947. The family maintain that he was not heard from again and they believe that he was either unlawfully killed or that he died in a prison or a camp. They do not believe that he returned to the UK. In the absence of a death certificate, the Appellant is unable to prove that he is no longer living. His date of birth was 9/11/1915 and, therefore, if he is alive today he will be 102 years old. 4. The family made enquiries with the Ministry of Defence (“MoD”). On 24/8/2016, the MoD (APC Disclosures 5 Polish) sent the email at page 63 of the bundle of evidence to the Appellant’s son-in-law. They confirmed that they hold the 2service records for JB but could not release them without his consent (or an authority from his official next of kin). They did, however disclose some information from his index card, the most relevant of which reads as follows: “ …………..Via Gibraltar, he moved to the United Kingdom and posted to 1 Grenadier Division on 10.08.1943. Served in the United Kingdom. Due to a gradual demobilisation of the Polish Forces under British command, he was commissioned in the Polish Resettlement Corps, served in the United Kingdom until finally relinquished his commission on 16/08/1948.” The same MOD officer subsequently wrote (page 64 of the bundle): “… [JB] must have lived on 16.08.1948 when he was released from the Polish Resettlement Corps (PKPR). On that day his service in the Polish Armed Services in the West under the British Command finished.” The request for information 5. On 24/4/2017, the Appellant wrote a 4 page letter to the MoD requesting information from JB’s service record. The Respondent has summarised the request for information in her decision notice. We noted that her request concludes as follows: “Conclussion [sic] • please, disclose the personal file of my uncle captain [JB] • if you cannot disclose the whole contents of that, please reveal at least the confirmation if my uncle still lived in 1948 • if also this was not possible, please read and check carefully the information from the personal file of captain [JB] related to 16.08.1948 and confirm in writing and give the reasons that captain [JB] really still lived in 1948” 6. The MoD responded on 28/7/2017, confirming that the service record was held but would not be disclosed in reliance on section 40(2) (personal information) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). They explained that, in the absence of proof of death, they were relying on their established policy of assuming that the person is not deceased until a period of 116 years has passed since their date of birth. The complaint to the Respondent 7. On 5/8/2017 the Appellant complained to the Respondent about the MOD’s refusal to provide the information requested. On 19/10/2017 the Commissioner issued her decision notice (Reference: FS50695574). She decided that the MoD was entitled to rely on section 40(2) to withhold the information and was not required to take any steps. 3The appeal 8. On 7/11/2017 the Appellant appealed to the First-tier tribunal against the Respondent’s decision. 9. The Appellant’s appeal grounds are set out on pages 10 to 14 of the bundle of evidence. They included some points that were outside our remit. The Appellant asserted, for example, that the MOD keeps the records of Polish soldiers illegally. We did not accept that, but it was not an issue that we have the power to consider. We are only concerned about information that is held by a public authority and whether the law requires it to be disclosed, and not why it is held in the first place. She also speculates about the nature of the information held, suggesting that it is not “top secret” or sensitive, when it is the laws referred to below that determine the protection that is given to personal information of whatever nature. 10. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising some 152 pages, including submissions made by both parties, which were helpful and thorough. The law and the issues we had to decide 11. Our task is set out in section 58 of FOIA: 58 Determination of appeals (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers— (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 12. Section 40(2) of FOIA is set out in full in Annex 1 to this decision. 13. The first issue we had to decide was whether the data held by the MoD and falling within the scope of the request constituted “personal data” (within the meaning of section 1(1) of the DPA) relating to JB. “personal data” means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified— 4(a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual; 14. If it did not constitute his personal data, section 40(2) could not be relied on to withhold the information. If it did, section 40(2) could only be relied on to withhold the information if its disclosure to a member of the public, other than under FOIA, would contravene any of the data protection principles. 15. Greater protection is given to “sensitive personal data”, defined in section 2 of the DPA as follows: In this Act “sensitive personal data” means personal data consisting of information as to— (a) the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject, (b) his political opinions, (c) his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, (d) whether he is a member of a trade union (within the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, (e) his physical or mental health or condition, (f) his sexual life, (g) the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or (h) any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. 16. It was clear that only section 40(3)(a)(i) was of potential relevance here. The evidence 17. The evidence before us consisted of an open bundle of evidence comprising 152 pages of evidence. We were unable to consider some of the evidence provided by the Appellant as it was in Polish. 18. We decided that we needed to see some of the information held by the MOD in order to decide whether its disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles. On 7/3/2018 we issued directions in the following terms. “2. The MoD is directed to provide copies of the following information to the Tribunal and to the Respondent only within 14 days: 5Any information which is held by the MoD relating to [JB] and which relates to the time period 1 January 1947 to the date when the MoD received the Appellant’s information request sent on 24/4/2017. 3. The Tribunal will treat any information received pursuant to paragraph 2 above as closed material, which will not be disclosed to the Appellant unless and until the Tribunal’s final decision is to order disclosure of some or all of that material. 4. If, following receipt of any information referred to in paragraph 2 above, the Respondent wishes to make any written representations as to whether she still considers that all or any of that information is exempt from disclosure in reliance on section 40(2) of FOIA, she may do so within 21 days. The Respondent must ensure that a copy of any such representations is provided to the MOD, even though the MOD is not a party to the appeal. 5. The MOD may send a written response to any such representations to the Tribunal within 21 days of their receipt. So far as possible, any such representations must be open and copies should be provided to both parties. If the MOD consider that all or part of their response should not be disclosed to another party, the MOD may apply to the Tribunal to be added as a party and for a direction to be given by the Tribunal that the information concerned will not be disclosed to specified other persons.” 19. On 16/3/2018, the MoD provided the Tribunal and the Respondent with the information sought (which from now on is referred to as “the closed material”). This consists of 17 pages of information, only 5 of which consist of, or include, information in the English language (the remainder is in Polish). Some of that information includes sensitive personal data. We were unable to consider the information that was in the Polish language. Our decision and the reasons for it Is the information sought personal data? 20. We were satisfied that the information sought constitutes “personal data” relating to JB. It is not known whether he is alive now or at the time of the request for information and there is no death certificate. On the face of it, the MoD’s policy of assuming that, in the absence of a death certificate, a person is assumed to be living until they would have reached 116 years of age seemed to us to be surprisingly cautious. However, in view of the substantial amount of personnel records that they hold, the importance of protecting the privacy of the individuals to whom they relate and the apparent acceptance by the Respondent of this policy, we considered this approach to be reasonable. And in any event, JB would have been 102 years of age at the time of the request if he was still living at that time, which falls considerably short of the cut-off age of 116. So, to be clear, we agreed that the MOD was right to treat him as a living individual in the absence of any formal proof to the contrary. Would its disclosure to a member of the public contravene any of the data protection principles? 21. The data protection principles are set out in Schedule 1 to the DPA. For the purposes of disclosure under FOIA, only the first data protection principle is of likely relevance: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— 6(a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met. 22. The issues we had to decide, in this order, were: • Whether disclosure of all or any of the closed material would be fair. • If so, would at least one Schedule 2 condition be met (and, in the case of any sensitive personal data, would at least one Schedule 3 condition be met). • If so, would the disclosure be lawful. Fairness 23. Our starting point was that, in the absence of any overriding factors, it would not be fair to disclose under FOIA (which is effectively a disclosure to the public at large) information from an individual’s service record. Only very exceptionally could this be said to be a reasonable expectation of the individual concerned. We decided, however, that this was one of those exceptional cases where it would be fair to disclose some information (but not any sensitive personal data) from that record. Our reasons were as follows. 24. The MOD has already disclosed to another (more distant) member of the Appellant’s family, without any restriction on the subsequent use of that information, some information from JB’s records indicating that he continued to serve in the United Kingdom until he relinquished his commission on 16/8/1948. The indications were that the MOD would have provided that information to any member of the general public and we therefore regarded it as being effectively in the public domain. 25. Given the background to this request and the other evidence before us, it seemed to us that there is a strong and legitimate interest in the Appellant and the public having access to information that confirms or, as the case may be, contradicts the information already provided by the MoD. In view of the disclosure that has already been made and the very long passage of time between the events in question and the date of the information request, we considered it unlikely that there could be any adverse consequences for JB of a further disclosure of information that could confirm or contradict the information that MoD has effectively placed in the public domain. 26. We considered that the balance between JB’s rights and freedoms on the one hand and the legitimate interests of the Appellant and the public in trying to ascertain the fate of a serving British soldier in the circumstances prevailing at that time was weighted in favour of disclosure of some of the closed material. Schedule 2 27. As we had decided that it would not be fair to disclose any sensitive personal data, it was only necessary for us to identify an applicable Schedule 2 condition. In the absence of the consent of the data subject, the only condition of potential relevance is condition 6(1): 76(1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 28. The leading case law on condition 6(1)1 has established that it requires the following three questions to be answered: a. Is the data controller or the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? b. Is the processing involved necessary for the purposes of those interests? c. Is the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? 29. We considered limbs a and c as part of the fairness test. We were satisfied that the Appellant is pursuing a legitimate interest and we did not consider that the disclosure of some of the withheld information would be unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of JB. As regards b, case law has established that “necessary” in this limb means “reasonably necessary” and not absolutely or strictly necessary and also that necessity requires the minimum interference with privacy rights. Against the background described by the Appellant, the MOD has asserted that JB was alive in August 1948. The disclosure of any information that confirms or undermines that assertion was in our judgement necessary for the purposes of the interests she is pursuing. Lawfulness 30. There are no specific statutory prohibitions of which we are aware that would make the disclosure of any of the withheld information unlawful. It is unlikely, given our decision on the question of fairness and condition 6(1) of Schedule 2, that a limited disclosure could contravene the Human Rights Act 1998. There are no obvious common law restrictions. We concluded that a limited disclosure of information would not be unlawful. 1 Goldsmith International Business School v Information Commissioner and Home Office [2014] UKUT 563 (AAC) at [35] - [42]. 8Conclusion 31. For the reasons given above, we decided that section 40(2) of FOIA did not apply to the entirety of JB’s service record and that the Respondent’s decision notice is not, therefore, fully in accordance with the law. The appeal is allowed in part and our substituted decision notice is set out in paragraph 1 above.

"721","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal Reference: EA/2017/0044 Decided without a hearing On 17/11/2017 Before JUDGE MISS FIONA HENDERSON TRIBUNAL MEMBERS DR MALCOLM CLARKE MR MICHAEL HAKE Between MR GERRY MURPHY (OBO IRISH NATIONAL TEACHERS ORGANISATION Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS Introduction 1. This is an appeal against decision notice FS506205526 dated 16th February 2016 in which the Information Commissioner upheld the Department of Education Northern Ireland’s (DENI) decision refusing to disclose the withheld information pursuant to s33 FOIA and s40(2) FOIA. The Appeal is allowed in part. Background 2. The Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) is a unitary inspectorate and part of DENI, providing independent inspection services and policy advice for DENI1. As such it was responsible for the inspection of St John the Baptist primary school between 23rd and 25th March 2015. This was a school with 417 enrolled pupils all of whom come from the surrounding area. An acting principal and acting vice principal were in post. 1 Insofar as it is relevant to this appeal 13. The focus of the inspection as set out in the final report was: 1. the children’s achievements and standards in literacy and numeracy, in particular, how the school is addressing low attainment and underachievement where applicable; 2. the quality of provision in the school and 3. the quality of leadership and management. 4. At the conclusion of the inspection the ETI inspectors informed the school management verbally that almost all of the teaching and learning in the school was good or very good with some outstanding. They were also told that the leadership and management since September (a time when the acting principal had taken over) was working well and addressing many issues. The verbal feedback was that the school was “good” for achievement and standards and provisions for learning and “satisfactory” for leadership and management and overall performance. 5. When the final written report was issued the outcome had been revised and the school’s overall performance levels was Inadequate: <U+F0B7> Achievements and standards Good <U+F0B7> Provision Good <U+F0B7> Leadership and Management Inadequate 6. The school was placed in the formal intervention process. This is not a punitive process but provides a framework for external support to raised standards, in this case provided by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. A school in formal intervention is subject to further monitoring by ETI inspections. The Appellant’s concern is that the verbal outcome was revised by the Assistant Chief Inspector and the Chief Inspector who had not attended the school as part of the inspection. 7. The final report was published in May 2015. Its comments on leadership and management were set out in 11 paragraphs at section 7 of the report and whilst praising aspects of the efforts by senior leadership team and governors for their efforts addressing issues arising out of sensitive and complex matters within the school, there remained concerns that documentation was not complete, reforms were in an early stage and not yet embedded in school policy, half of the school building was not in use and that this was a health and safety concern. In arriving at the overall performance level of inadequate, the report took into account their concerns relating to leadership and management, accommodation and health and safety which they listed in 4 areas to address and an appendix of health and safety concerns. Information Request 8. The appellant wrote to DENI on 12th October 2015 asking for the following information: 1. “Every iteration of the written inspection report from first draft through to final written report published on the ETI website in May of 2015. 2. All notes, written and electronic, prepared by all inspectors involved directly or indirectly, before, during and after the inspection in St John the Baptist PS relating to the completion of the final written report. 23. All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the Reporting Inspector and Deputy Reporting Inspector for this inspection and the Deputy Chief Inspector with responsibility for inspections in the primary sector and the Chief Inspector concerning this inspection and production of the final written report in May of 2015. 4. All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the Chief Inspector and the Deputy Chief Inspector with responsibility for inspections in the primary sector relating to this inspection and the Deputy Permanent Secretaries and Permanent Secretary in the Department of Education from the completion of the inspection in March 2015 up to and following the publication of the final written report in May of 2015. 5. All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the ETI and parents of children attending St John the Baptist PS, the Board of Governors of St John the Baptist PS, third parties such as the CCMS, community or political representatives, trade unions other than INTO and members of the public relating to the inspection in St John the Baptist PS completed in March 2015. 6. Any other document held by the ETI pertinent to this inspection.” 9. DENI refused to disclose the information requested in parts 1-4 relying upon s33(1)(b) FOIA by virtue of s33(2) FOIA. They also relied upon s 40(2) FOIA in relation to part 52 and some of part 6. However, they disclosed some information in relation to part 6. This refusal was upheld upon internal review on 20th January 20163. Complaint to the Commissioner 10. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 11.03.16 disputing that s33 FOIA was engaged and arguing that the public interest favoured disclosure. The Commissioner upheld the reliance upon s33 FOIA in relation to most of the information that had been withheld, she found that it did not apply to the final inspection report published on the ETI’s website in May 20154. Appeal 11. The Appellant appealed on 16th March 2017. His grounds can be summarised as arguing that in relation to s33 FOIA: i. The exemption was not engaged as: a) disclosure would not be premature as the information was not requested until after the conclusion of the final report, b) The Commissioner had misapplied the concept of “safe space” which was necessary whilst coming to a conclusion; however, once the conclusion was formed the process at which it was arrived should be disclosed. ii. The Commissioner misjudged the balance of public interest and had given insufficient weight to: a) The prejudice to teachers, pupils and parents of such a finding. 2 Before the Commissioner DENI and ICO were in agreement that in fact the material in part 5 fell within s33 FOIA as it formed part of the inspection materials. 3 The reviewer also applied s41 FOIA to part 5. In light of her findings the Commissioner did not go on to consider s41 in the decision notice and it is not material to our findings upon appeal. 4 Before the Commissioner DENI noted that it had erroneously included this report in the withheld information when it was in fact already available on the website, and the Appellant should have been directed there. 3b) the fact that the conclusion had been changed after the evidence gathering had taken place and by someone who had not themselves attended the school inspection. c) The need for transparency in these circumstances. d) The report is internally inconsistent and the evidence is necessary to evaluate the conclusions. e) The report took into account matters relating to the previous principal which was outside the scope of the inspection and unfair to the school. The withheld material is necessary to understand the impact of this on the decision. f) The Commissioner’s decision was too general and had not looked at the detail and different categories of the withheld material. 12. In relation to information withheld under s40 FOIA disclosure would not be unfair or unwarranted: a) There was no expectation of confidentiality on the letters sent to those who provided information to the inspection. b) If necessary parent/pupil/staff/governor identities could be redacted. c) Those inspecting the school are public servants who should expect scrutiny and to stand by the work they have done. 13. All parties have consented to the case being determined upon the papers and the Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing pursuant to rule 32(1) (Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (GRC Rules), being in receipt of an open bundle of documents comprising some 94 pages and a closed bundle containing the withheld material divided into 6 tabs corresponding to the limbs of the information request. In proceeding without an oral hearing the Tribunal has had regard to the overriding objective as set out in rule 2 GRC rules and has had regard to costs, proportionality and the narrow issues in this case. It has had regard to all the documentary evidence before it, even where not mentioned directly in this decision. 14. The Tribunal has set out its general reasoning with as much detail as it is able in the open decision; it has prepared a closed annex which sets out in more detail with specific reference to the information withheld its reasons for withholding the information. The Tribunal has concluded that some further information should be disclosed but with redactions, this is detailed within the closed annex. Upon confirmation that DENI have complied with the Tribunal’s decision to disclose the documents as specified, a proportion of the closed annex can be made open and promulgated upon the order of the Tribunal. Ground 15. S33 FOIA provides that: (1)This section applies to any public authority which has functions in relation to— … (b)the examination of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which other public authorities use their resources in discharging their functions. 4(2)Information held by a public authority to which this section applies is exempt information if its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the exercise of any of the authority’s functions in relation to any of the matters referred to in subsection (1). S33 FOIA is a qualified exemption and is therefore subject to the public interest test as set out in s2(2)(b) FOIA. Whether Exemption is engaged 16. The first issue for the Tribunal is whether DENI has the required audit functions provided for in s33 (1)(b). This is not disputed in the grounds of appeal and the Tribunal adopts the Commissioner’s reasoning at paragraphs 19-21 of the decision Notice in concluding that DENI do have the required audit functions. 17. The next issue is whether disclosure would 5 have a prejudicial effect on the functions performed by the ETI. We are satisfied that “would” in this context means a strong likelihood prejudice which equates to more than a 50% chance. We accept the evidence as set out in DENI’s representations to the Commissioner DENI that its functions include making evidence based judgments from an audit point of view as well as providing evidence based policy advice, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of key policies in practice and making evaluative comment on the quality of education being provided system -wide. It depends upon inspection evidence to fulfil these functions. 18. The Tribunal is satisfied that if disclosure were to undermine the quality of the evidence gathered or the decision making process followed or if it were to undermine the findings; then that would be prejudice such that the exemption would be engaged. 19. DENI argued before the Commissioner that Inspectors would be slower and more cautious over the recording of their notes, thus reducing the amount of information recorded and diminishing the inspection evidence base. This would also delay the timely production of inspection reports within agreed deadlines. This contention is not accepted by the Appellant and was rejected by the ICO. The Tribunal also rejects this argument. The subtext of this argument (were it to be accepted) is that in the absence of this level of scrutiny Inspectors rush their work which they do not complete with care. We take into account that Inspectors are bound by a statutory duty with an obligation of professionalism and that they can be expected to know that their records fall within the ambit of FOIA. 20. In her decision notice the Commissioner considered whether premature disclosure could affect the behaviour of the organisation being inspected. The Appellant argues that this is misconceived as by the time of his request the report was finalised and published. We understand the Commissioner to mean by “premature” the disclosure of information prior to its final state (ie when incomplete) however, we accept the Appellant’s argument in relation to this inspection but take the impact of “premature” disclosure into account in relation to its impact on future inspections (in relation to this and other organisations). 5 DENI have relied upon this limb 521. The Commissioner also raised the issue of a general prejudice from disclosure revealing specific audit/inspection techniques that were not already known to the public. The Tribunal has had regard to the transparency surrounding the inspection process including the involvement of a representative, the information in letters to those involved, information online and from the final reports itself. We have also had regard to the material in the closed bundle and we are not satisfied that this is applicable on the facts of this case. Similarly, before the Commissioner, DENI argued that during inspection there is triangulation, new lines of enquiry emerge as evidence is shared between team members during meetings. It was not apparent to the Tribunal that “new lines of enquiry” emerged in these documents on the facts of this case, but we accept that it is likely that the focus of e.g. subsequent observations has been informed by the feedback of other members of the team. 22. The Commissioner argued that disclosure would: i. undermine the collection of information and evidence by creating a chilling effect whereby people would fear that their contributions would be made public, discouraging co-operation with the inspector in the future. ii. undermine ETI’s assessment and analysis of the evidence, with inspectors fearing that their early thoughts, assumptions or conclusions will be held against them or their later findings. They are entitled to “space” to consider evidence and reach fully formed decisions taking into account all material available. Disclosure of the record of this would impair decision making and have a detrimental impact on the quality of the final report. iii. Undermine the ETI’s function to make evidence-based evaluations if findings could be readily undermined or called into question by the disclosure of earlier reporting that does not accurately represent the ETI’s fully developed views. 23. The Appellant disagrees; he argues that there was no promise or expectation of confidentiality in relation to the consultees. He maintains that the function of the inspectors is to be free and frank, this is their role. He argues that disclosure would not undermine ability to make evidence based evaluations, but it would facilitate engagement and understanding of the final decision. 24. We have had regard to the process that is undertaken at achieving the final report. The inspectors observed teaching and learning, scrutinised documentation and the children’s written work and held formal and informal discussions with children, teachers and staff. They met representatives from the governors, met with groups of children and gave parents, teaching and support staff the opportunity to complete a questionnaire6. In recording this information the individual inspectors deploy their professional judgment. There is then a moderation process and a final moderation process. The report goes out in the name of the Chief Inspector who must therefore approve the report. Advice can be sought from within EDI. The report is drafted, with the opportunity to suggest corrections from specified consultees until a pre-publication copy of the report is issued followed by the final report. 6 Final inspection report p1 at p 29 OB 625. The process requires that the evidence collected provides sufficient information to create an audit trail to assess consistency with evidence for findings and final conclusions. We accept that for the inspection process to be effective it is necessary that honest and candid views are received, both from the school community and the inspectors undertaking the inspection process. We set out below in detail our findings relating to expectation, redaction and the identifiability of those involved and are satisfied that the school community would be less frank if they thought that their views would be made public. Similarly we are satisfied that inspectors would be less forthright if they believed information could be disclosed that showed their evolving thought processes. We accept the need to retain some degree of private thinking space while decisions are being made and whilst the totality of information is being gathered and analysed. Members of the inspection team and ETI’s senior management should be expected to draw on the experience of each other, to discuss issues openly, frankly and robustly without the need to defend views that were not fully formed or that they no longer hold. This flow of information would be jeopardised by disclosure. We are also satisfied that it would undermine the authority of the final report which will have been arrived at following a process of development. We are therefore satisfied that the exemption is engaged. Public interest. 26. We now go on to consider the public interest. In favour of disclosure: i. Society places a high value on education and effective oversight is therefore very important, disclosure would add transparency and enable scrutiny of that process. ii. Disclosure would enable the public to trust in the ability of the ETI to carry out fair and thorough inspections of schools iii. Disclosure would add to the public understanding of the apparent contradiction between the verbal outcome and the final outcome which if left unexplained could undermine public trust. iv. A better understanding of the reasons for the eventual outcome would be important in a community which we accept has been demoralised by the report’s conclusions. 27. In favour of maintaining the exemption we take into account: i. The importance of the role of ETI to evaluate standards and identify where improvements are needed (as evidenced by statutory powers granted it) in support of the contention that anything which hinders or degrades functions will be contrary to the public interest. ii. Anything which undermines the quality of evidence received, the quality of the internal debate, assessment and scrutiny of evidence by the decision makers and the quality of the reasoning and decision making is not in the public interest. iii. Drafts undermine the considered concluded view by diluting the final position and highlighting areas of nuance and fine judgment. iv. Final conclusions can be undermined relying upon records of incomplete thinking. v. There was significant public concern of some duration around management and leadership. Disclosure in response to the request would seriously 7risk undermining acceptance and the success of the report’s proposals to address these issues. 28. When balancing these considerations we give significant weight to the need for free space away from external scrutiny to debate and reach conclusions. Similarly, those thinking of passing on information voluntarily will want to know it can be kept secure. We have given weight to the transparency already provided by the publication of the final report and the methodology of the inspection. We accept that ETI hold numerous events to explain to stakeholders how inspection works in practice, guidance for Principals is available on the ETI website, a senior member of staff is involved in all the inspection meetings and the moderation meeting where the acting principal heard the evidence used to reach a conclusion as well as the publication of all reports (including the report in this case) on the website7. 29. We are satisfied that the value of transparency is less strong where information is incomplete and does not represent a final position. Having had regard to the withheld information we are not satisfied that the majority of the information would further the stated public interests in disclosure as set out more specifically below and in the closed annex. However, where the withheld information adds transparency to the process of reviewing and ultimately changing the report’s conclusion we are satisfied that the public interest favours disclosure. Request 1 “Every iteration of the written inspection report from first draft through to final written report published on the ETI website in May of 2015.” 30. DENI has described this aspect of the withheld material (tab 1) as being draft versions subject to editing and moderation as part of the robust quality assurance process8. 31. The Appellant seemed to suggest that he was not seeking the drafts9 but as this is explicitly requested in part 1 of the request the Tribunal has nevertheless considered it in scope. Having reviewed the documents we take into consideration that by this stage what is in issue is version control and fine tuning, the decision already having been arrived at in substance. The process followed ensures that the reports are fair and accurate and balanced. It is an opportunity to correct perceived factual errors and emphasis. The drafts are distributed to a range of people with the opportunity to comment. The list of consultees is already public as part of the inspection framework. The drafts do not shed light on the reasons for the change from the verbal to the final conclusion identified by the Appellant. They drafts are not public at that time and as such we are satisfied that those commenting would expect their input to remain confidential. 32. From the comments it can be seen what each particular individual’s concerns are and the extent to which their views have been adopted. Where a comment has not been adopted this can be expected to have professional implications in terms of other’s perception of their priorities and authority. We are satisfied that disclosure 7 P90 OB letter from DENI to Commissioner July 2016 8 P88 OB letter to ICO July 2016 9 P21 OB 8would inhibit future comment with consultees being more cautious in their engagement in this process. Were the comments to be disclosed the reasons for the agreement or failure to adopt the proposed changes would be in debate and would undermine the authority of the final report. Request 2 All notes, written and electronic, prepared by all inspectors involved directly or indirectly, before, during and after the inspection in St John the Baptist PS relating to the completion of the final written report. 33. From DENI’s letter to the ICO July 201610 they argue that these notes inform the evaluation of an organisation’s provision but also emerging and summary evaluations at any given point in time and could be subject to misrepresentation when taken in isolation. It is only through the moderation process and final moderation meeting that the final evaluations are arrived at. 34. The Record of Inspection Booklets contains the majority of the inspection evidence including contemporaneous inspectors’ notes relating to the lessons observed for individual teachers. Notes are personal and identifiable as they relate to interviews, lesson observations, meetings with staff members in an organisation. Additionally, they argue that disclosure would be a breach of DPA. 35. Having viewed the information the Tribunal accepts that this includes the raw material from which the conclusions are drawn. They are the inspector’s personal data indicating their own individual preliminary views which have not yet taken the entirety of the evidence and views of others fully into account. The conclusions have been evidenced and reasons given in the final decision of the report, the raw material is not inconsistent with the facts as set out in the final report however, disclosure of the raw material would undermine the final report as it would invite others to form their own view from notes which we are satisfied are not the complete evidence being by their nature a synopsis/aide memoire to assist in the process of reaching a collective view. 36. We take into consideration that transparency is already provided through the process of feedback given to participants during the inspection process. We are also satisfied that from the framework of the inspection and the publication of other reports; participants in the meetings and the subjects (both staff and pupils) of the lesson observations would not expect details of their individual performance to be made public. Even if the name of the teacher were to be removed the lesson would still be identifiable by the subject and curriculum followed which would designate the year group. The children would be able to identify the lesson and their own participation from the content. We take into consideration the small pool of individuals in a primary school in concluding that individual contribution would be identifiable and in our judgment exposure of this level of detail is not in the public interest. Request 3 All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the Reporting Inspector and Deputy Reporting Inspector for this inspection and the 10 P88 onwards 9Deputy Chief Inspector with responsibility for inspections in the primary sector and the Chief Inspector concerning this inspection and production of the final written report in May of 2015. 37. DENI argue that this information forms part of the moderation and quality assurance process and represents private thinking space. 38. In assessing the public interest, the Tribunal is satisfied that some of this information (as set out in the closed schedule) should be disclosed. The Tribunal takes into consideration that the staff and parents and local community have been given conflicting information by the inspection team; there having been a fundamental change between the verbal feedback and the written report. DENI argue that this was always only a provisional view and the quality assurance process prior to the publication of the final report meant that there was always the potential that this could change. However, we take into account that this is not a change in nuance but a different conclusion arrived at taking into account the same facts. As such the Tribunal is satisfied that for these pieces of information the “safe thinking space” carries less weight. Disclosure would not reveal a half- formed view that they would have to defend. The provisional view has already been disclosed and the ETI are being asked to justify why it has changed and to defend their final decision (in the context of information that they have made public). 39. The Tribunal takes into consideration the impact on morale and confidence that the final decision has had in the continuing operation of the school as set out in the Appellant’s submissions. Although reasons are given in the report for the current conclusion it does not explain why this conclusion is different from that of the inspection “team on the ground” and why the results in teaching and lesson provision were “outweighed” by the administrative ones. Whilst the report goes out in the name of the Chief Inspector who can be expected to be part of the decision making process; the purpose of having a “team on the ground” is likely to be viewed as the opportunity for the inspectors to form a view based on observation and first hand evidence. If that is rejected or overturned reasons for this ought to be transparent as should the process followed. The Tribunal is satisfied that the current position has not explained adequately the reasoning behind the change of view which from the material before us we accept is undermining acceptance of the report as stakeholders appear to have concluded that the final decision may have been made without due rigour, and suspect that outside influences have been at play or irrelevant material has been taken into account. 40. It is DENI policy that all personal details from below Grade 5 should be redacted when information is being disclosed, however the grades of those at the ETI identified in the material concerned, are not known to the Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is satisfied from their job descriptions and role as evidenced within the closed material that they are of sufficient seniority and forward facing that disclosure of their involvement in this professional process would not be unfair or unwarranted neither would it breach the DPA for the reasons set out below. 41. The Tribunal is satisfied that correspondence within this section which does not shed light on the reasons for or process of changing the final decision or which 10relates to the period after the decision had been changed should not be disclosed as it is not in the public interest. The Tribunal also relies upon the expectation of confidentiality from stakeholders, as set out in the closed schedule. Request 4 All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the Chief Inspector and the Deputy Chief Inspector with responsibility for inspections in the primary sector relating to this inspection and the Deputy Permanent Secretaries and Permanent Secretary in the Department of Education from the completion of the inspection in March 2015 up to and following the publication of the final written report in May of 2015. 42. DENI’s case is that this material informs the moderation and quality assurance process11. The Tribunal has had regard to this information and is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to disclose it. The Tribunal has considered the date and content of any correspondence. We are satisfied that it does not inform the process followed or the reasons for the change in the final decision. To the extent that the content of correspondence refers to the input from stakeholders we repeat our findings relating to their expectation of confidentiality as set out elsewhere in this decision. Request 5 All communications of a written and electronic nature between and amongst the ETI and parents of children attending St John the Baptist PS, the Board of Governors of St John the Baptist PS, third parties such as the CCMS, community or political representatives, trade unions other than INTO and members of the public relating to the inspection in St John the Baptist PS completed in March 2015. 43. This includes the detailed data breakdown and comments from the questionnaires. The general statistics are set out in the report which we are satisfied provided transparency. The Tribunal takes into account the very small numbers involved in assessing the identifiability of the respondents even if anonymised. We are satisfied that there was an explicit expectation of confidentiality as evidenced by the information provided to consultees.12 The Appellant argues that the statistical groupings within the final report are misleading and inconsistent. His case is that the statement that a “significant minority (defined as 30-49%) of parents raised concerns” cannot be right as only 6% of parents responded. The report makes it plain 13 that it is referring to those who responded not the general population of parents at the school and from the sentence structure it is also apparent that this is an amalgamated figure for all the categories of respondees rather than an assertion as to the individual categories. We therefore do not accept that the synopsis provided is misleading or ambiguous and that the raw data should be disclosed to provide clarification. Additionally, where material is similar to that appearing in earlier categories it is withheld for the same reasons. 44. We are however satisfied that some additional disclosure from this part of the disputed information should be provided. To the extent that any person outside of ETI is identified for the reasons set out under personal data we consider that this can be redacted. This is information which gives further detail of ETI’s reasoning 11 P88 OB et seq 12 E.g p47 OB and p43 OB 13 P32 OB 11for the change of decision. Although not in the public domain we have taken into consideration the extent to which it has been made known to those outside of ETI in concluding that any “chilling effect” on ETI inspectors in future inspections is likely to be minimal. Request 6 Any other document held by the ETI pertinent to this inspection. 45. Much of this information is a duplication of information considered above. The Tribunal has had regard to the content and the date of the information, in determining that it is not in the public interest to disclose this information as it does not add to the transparency of the process and relates to correspondence from individuals who would not expect their correspondence to be public in these circumstances. Personal Data 46. There is an overlap between the public interest in disclosure and whether disclosure would breach the data protection principles as provided for by s40 FOIA which states: —(1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied…. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, … (7) In this section— “the data protection principles” means the principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998, as read subject to Part II of that Schedule and section 27(1) of that Act; “data subject” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act; “personal data” has the same meaning as in section 1(1) of that Act. 47. The Appellant does not dispute that the data is personal data and we adopt the Commissioner’s reasons set out in the Commissioner’s decision at paragraph 47. 1248. The first data protection principle provides that: Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless— (a)at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, … 49. Part II of Schedule I provides: 1)In determining for the purposes of the first principle whether personal data are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed. 50. Information from those who completed questionnaires. In concluding that it would not be fair to disclose this information we take into account that in the final report14 the questionnaires were stated to be confidential, this is consistent with the assertion of confidentiality to consultees which formed part of the instructions for participation15. We are satisfied that the participants had no expectation that their identity would become known to the inspection team let alone the general public: “Please note while all questionnaire submissions are confidential they are not anonymous… [name/teacher reference number] will not be passed on to the inspection team”16. Whilst the raw data is therefore not named, disclosure is to the public and as set out below we are satisfied that this information would not be anonymous in the public domain. 51. We have taken into consideration the personal nature of the information gathered (e.g. satisfaction, complaint or praise for individuals, whether a child is safe or thriving etc.) in concluding that disclosure would be distressing, unwarranted and therefore unfair. We have considered whether this information could be redacted and are satisfied that it could not. We take into account the small pool of participants (a school roll of 471, only 6% parents responding) and the likelihood that even if anonymised identifying factors such as gender, age, subject and educational attainment would become evident. We are satisfied that the same considerations apply in relation to those who were interviewed and spoke directly to the inspectors. 52. Personal data from a review of work and lesson observations. We are satisfied that this encompasses both the personal data of the teacher and the pupils. The pupils would be at risk of unwarranted peer scrutiny as well as self-identification. The nature of the observation is to form a judgment which can be critical or positive and could include an assessment that a child is underachieving, or disruptive or writes messily etc. That would be damaging and distressing for them (or their family) to have vented publicly. In relation to teachers we are satisfied that in light of the historic appearance of ETI reports when published there would be no 14 P1 of the report at p 29 OB 15 P43 and 47 OB 16 Eg from Completing the online Teacher/support staff questionnaire 13expectation that they or their competency would be identifiable in such an inspection report and that this would also be distressing with the potential for professional ramifications. We are satisfied that this information cannot be anonymised due to the small number of those involved and the distinguishing features of each lesson (by way of content, curriculum and teacher approach). 53. 3rd parties not directly involved in the inspection process or involved subsequently. We are satisfied that they would not have the expectation that their personal data or involvement would be made public and that disclosure would be unfair particularly in circumstances where they were not able to comment or where the consequences of their identification would have negative professional consequences for them. 54. Personal data of the school inspection team. We are satisfied that it is not customary for their notes to be disclosed but we are satisfied that they would know that they fall within FOIA and that as such they are capable of disclosure. However, we are satisfied that it would be unfair to disclose the work done prior to the verbal feedback as this would expose them to unwarranted scrutiny in relation to the record of their developing thought processes and evaluation of incomplete evidence. 55. In relation to the work post the verbal feedback; ordinarily this would continue to be a refinement of the conclusions reached and communicated verbally which could expect to be disclosed when fully formed in the final report. On the facts of this case we are satisfied that in light of the significant change in conclusion after the physical inspection phase had finished, there would be an expectation that this would need to be explained in greater detail. As set out above we are satisfied that to the extent that disclosure would confirm that the proper processes were being followed there would be no unwarranted distress in disclosure and that all of those whose input would be revealed would be of sufficient seniority in terms of their role in this inspection that they would expect to be professionally accountable to the public in concluding that disclosure in this regard would not be unfair. 56. In relation to the personal data disclosable in the documents identified by the Tribunal which we have determined would not be unfair we have gone on to consider the schedule 2 conditions. Schedule 2 condition 6 provides: 6(1)The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 57. We have applied the approach as set out in Goldsmith International Business School v the Information Commissioner and the Home Office 2014 UK UT 0563 (AAC). As such we are satisfied that the Appellant (and the wider public) do have a legitimate interest in the data identified. The ETI having given what appear to be 2 different conclusions based upon the same evidence, in circumstances where there is confusion and dismay on the part of the stakeholders with the outcome and insufficient clarity of the circumstances and considerations that have led to this outcome. We are satisfied that the data is necessary for the purposes of those 14interests17. Although we accept that there is considerable contact with some of the stakeholders the wider community who are invested in the success of the school as parents, staff or pupils have not been given clarity, and this is all the more important in light of the publicity that this decision is likely to have had locally. 58. The Tribunal has considered redacting the information so that those whose actions and views are described in the withheld information would not be disclosed. In light of the hierarchy and structure of the organisation concerned we are satisfied that removing the name would not anonymise the information as it would be easily attributable. 59. We have then considered whether the processing is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject? We are satisfied that it is not. Those involved have public facing roles and responsibility within the organisation; this is a professional matter which does not impinge on their private life. All those involved can be expected to know that they are subject to FOIA and that they should be accountable for and able to justify their decisions especially in circumstances where the course of the inspection appears to have departed from the expected pattern. In our judgment disclosure of the information identified in the closed schedule does not fall within the s40 FOIA exemption. Conclusion 60.

"79","EIR","First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) Information Rights Appeal References: EA/2017/0036, 0074 and 0075 Decided without a hearing Before CHRIS RYAN JUDGE Between PHILIP THORNEWELL Appellant and THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION AND REASONS Subject matter: FOIA: Whether information held s.1IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2017/0036, 0074 and 0075 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The appeals are dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. Under a Case Management Direction dated 19 April 2017 it was directed that these Appeals should be considered together. All three arose from requests made by the Appellant to Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council (“the Council”) and arose from the Appellant’s concerns about various aspects of the Council’s March 2016 publication entitled “Rotherham Local Plan Submission Sites & Policies Consultation Statement” and planning processes related to that document. 2. The Chambers President has directed that the appeals are suitable to be decided by a Judge alone and the Appellant has opted to have that decision made on the basis of the papers, without an oral hearing. I am satisfied that these were both appropriate procedures to adopt for the determination of these particular appeals. 3. Despite the connection between all three appeals I propose to deal with each in turn. APPEAL FROM DECISION NOTICE FS50657166 OF 8 FEBRUARY 2017 (EA/2017/0036) 4. This arose from the Appellant’s concern that the Council had established a predominantly internet-based process for planning purposes and that the effect was to “disenfranchise” those who did not have access to the internet, including older residents. 5. A lengthy information request submitted on 20 August 2016 was intended assist the Appellant to investigate that concern. However, it was refused by the Council and, after an internal review of that decision had produced the same result, the Appellant submitted a complaint to the Information Commissioner which, it was agreed, should be treated as an invitation to the Information Commissioner to investigate the Council’s rejection of the following requests: “How did [the Council] decide that a predominantly internet/database based process did not disadvantage/disenfranchise older residents or other minority groups? Given the size and complexity of the database and documents, what was done to optimise these for devices other than PCs (eg tablets, phones)?”.6. The Council’s position at that stage was that it did not hold any information that fell within the scope of either part of the request. Accordingly, it argued, its rejection of the information request did not breach its obligation, under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), to make information it held available to anyone who requested it. 7. As to the first part of the information request the Council wrote to the Information Commissioner with the following explanation: “The Council does not hold the information requested. There is no information relating to any decision as to whether the Council considered its web-based approach for Local Plan consultation disenfranchised any groups. Government regulations set out how the Council must publicise its Local Plan …As the Council was following the regulations it had to meet in publicising the Local Plan, the question of whether this was an appropriate approach id not arise …” 8. In respect of the second part of the information request the Council pointed out that its website was optimised for mobile and tablet device access. There was therefore no need to take any steps to improve the situation and none was taken. No information was therefore held about that, non-existent, activity. 9. The Information Commissioner accepted both of the Council’s submissions and therefore concluded that the Council had been right to say that, on the balance of probabilities, it did not hold any information falling within the scope of the information request. 10. The Appellant appealed the Information Commissioner’s decision notice to this Tribunal but his Grounds of Appeal contained no mention of the rejection of the second part of the information request. As to the first part he argued, simply, that the Council had been under an obligation to ensure that developments in digital publishing and interaction with the public did not leave behind those who were unable or unwilling to adapt to modern online systems. He argued that it was “utterly incredible” in those circumstances that the Council had no information on how well the system would meet the needs of that group. He added: “If it is confirmed that there is no information, then I probably need to pursue that via the National Audit Office” 11. I have approached the issue on the basis that I must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Council did not hold the relevant information at the time of the information request. I should consider the way the Council approached that request, the focus and care of the search made for any relevant information and the credibility of the result that ensued from those processes. 12. I do not accept that the Appellant’s case is supported by the fact that there is a general approach, across all governing bodies, of introducing digitisation in a way that does not leave behind those without the necessary equipment or inclination to use it. The Appellant has certainly not established that the existence of that policy undermines the credibility of the Council’s statement that it did not feel the need to make a specific decision on the point in relation to the relevant part of its planning processes. The fact that it did not is supported by the fact that (as the Appellant was told by the Council when rejecting the information request on internal review) it did not rely on the internet alone but made copies of consultation documents available in its libraries and provided other means for the public to participate.13. The regime established by the FOIA does not authorise this Tribunal to determine whether a public body should have created a record of information in particular circumstances. Its jurisdiction is limited to determining whether it did in fact hold such a record at the time when it received an information request. The Appellant’s comments on how the Council should have behaved therefore have limited relevance. 14. I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities the Council did not hold the information requested in either part of the information request in this case. The Decision Notice is therefore correct and the Appeal should be refused. APPEAL FROM DECISION NOTICE FS50657153 OF 14 MARCH 2017 (EA/2017/0074) 15. The Appellant believes that the March 2016 consultation document contained an error. It described a particular site as being in a place called Dinnington, when he believed it was in fact in a place called Todwick. 16. The relevant request for the purpose of this Appeal was sent to the Council on 21 August 2016 and was in these terms: “Could I please have a copy of all information, including meeting minutes and email exchanges relating to how [the Council] reacted to the information that site LD830 was in Todwick, what was considered, how and why it decided to continue to refer to the site as in Dinnington, and what efforts were made to ensure that Todwick residents and others were not confused by the continued use of geographically inaccurate labelling…….” 17. I have some sympathy with the Council in determining how to respond to a communication in that form, which appears to have been designed to make a point of criticism rather than to operate as a genuine request for information. The Council’s initial responses were muddled, but it settled on a “not held” response during the Information Commissioner’s investigation of the Appellant’s complaint over the response he had received. 18. The essence of the Council’s argument, which it maintained during this Appeal, was that: a. The description of the site’s location was based on the geography of the area rather than strict compliance with parish boundaries. b. It had never considered that residents and others would be confused by the location description and had not therefore held any meetings on the subject or debated it in email correspondence. c. The Council had nevertheless consulted with senior officials in its Planning Department in an effort to trace any recorded information that did exist. None had been located. 19. The Information Commissioner concluded, following careful analysis of the facts and arguments, that the Council had contacted the relevant parties to consider whether any relevant information was held. She was satisfied, on the basis of the reported outcome of those enquires, that none was. 20. In lengthy grounds of appeal to support his appeal to this Tribunal the Appellant provided detail on his concerns about the Council’s planning processes and hisvarious communications with the Council on the subject. In particular, he criticised the Council for the way that it had described the location of the piece of land under consideration and explained why he thought this disadvantaged those wishing to be involved in the planning debate encouraged by the March 2016 consultation document. Although the Appellant said that he accepted that it was not the role of the Information Commissioner to involver herself in those issues, it seemed to me that his case was based on the argument that the Council should have agreed with his view on how the land should have been described and that it was absurd that it had not held discussions on the point and recorded the outcome of those discussions. 21. In a written Response to the Appeal the Information Commissioner acknowledged that the Appellant may believe that the requested information should be held by the Council, but argued that this was irrelevant and that the Decision Notice was correct in considering whether or not it in fact did hold it. 22. I approach this Appeal on the same basis as set out in paragraph 11 above. The Council made an appropriate search and the fact that this produced no information within the scope of the information request was entirely to be expected, given the Council’s explanation of the approach that, rightly or wrongly, it took to the way in which the land in question had been described. 23. Once again, therefore, I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities the Council did not hold the information requested the information request in this case. The Decision Notice is therefore correct and the Appeal should be refused. APPEAL FROM DECISION NOTICE FS50657154 OF 14 MARCH 2017 (EA/2017/0075) 24. The Decision Notice from which this Appeal arises was limited to one aspect of a lengthy information request submitted to the Council by the Appellant on 21 August 2016. The Council had said that it did not hold a list of requests for meetings or a list of meetings held in respect of certain planning issues, even though it had stated publicly that such meetings had taken place with members of the public who wished to engage with a planning officer outside more open forum discussions. 25. The Decision Notice recorded the questions the Information Commissioner had put to the Council about the nature and extent of the search for information that had been made. The Council’s response was that no relevant information had been found even though it had consulted the two senior officers who had dealt with the preparation of the local plan since its inception in 2006. The Information Commissioner was told that, whereas careful records were kept of public meetings, drop in sessions and organised workshops held as part of the consultation on the local plan, no equivalent records had been kept of less formal interchanges. 26. The Information Commissioner concluded that, while she appreciated the Appellant’s frustration that the Council did not hold the specific information he sought, the test to be applied, again, was not whether such information ought to have been recorded and retained, but whether it had in fact been so recorded and retained. She was satisfied on the basis of the evidence provided to her that, on the balance of probabilities, no relevant information was held.27. In his Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant again raised a number of wider issues, with which I need not concern myself. He criticised the Information Commissioner for having accepted that a statement by the Council that it did not hold a “list” of meetings was an adequate response to the information request because, the Appellant argued, there could be other information which would have gone to answer the questions he had posed. However, the main point of the Grounds of Appeal was that it was not credible that the Council could have managed a process of receiving and responding to requests for meetings without having maintained at least some records. 28. The Information Commissioner’s written Response to the Appeal argued that the Council’s response to the information request had been carefully explained – enquiries made of the two officers with relevant knowledge had not brought any information to light and there was no evidence to contradict that explanation. 29. I have sympathy with the Appellant on two aspects of the Council’s behaviour in relation to the subject matter of this information request. It does seem strange that no relevant information exists in circumstances where any member of the public was able to ask for a meeting and, I assume, the Council was interested in the views expressed at such meetings. I also think that the initial response from the Council was a little ambiguous in that it focused on the existence of a “list” of meetings and appeared not to consider other forms in which information about such meetings may have been recorded. 30. However, during the Information Commissioner’s investigation a fuller explanation was given of the enquiries the Council made and I have decided that this provided a credible explanation for why no relevant information was uncovered. On balance, therefore (and based again on the approach described in paragraph 11 above) I have decided that the Information Commissioner was correct to have concluded that the Council did not hold any information falling within the scope of the information request. 31. In this case also, therefore, I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities the Council did not hold the information requested. The Decision Notice is therefore correct and the Appeal should be refused. Chris Ryan Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Date of Decision: 17 January 2018 Promulgated: 17 January 2018"

We have decided that the Information Commissioner was right to conclude, in her Decision Notice dated 1 December 2016 (FS50639686), that the Second Respondent did not hold the information requested by the Appellant at the time of the request and that the Appeal should therefore be dismissed. The Appellant’s information request and the Decision Notice 2. On 18 April 2016, the Appellant wrote to the Department for Trade and Industry (now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and referred to in this decision as “the Department”), asking it to disclose a report on an investigation by the Companies Investigation Branch into allegations that British American Tobacco had been involved in cigarette smuggling (“the Report”). 3. Under section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), the Department, as a public authority, is obliged to disclose requested information unless certain conditions apply or the information falls within one of a number of exemptions set out in FOIA. 4. On 23 May 2016, the Department wrote to the Appellant to inform him that it had searched its records in both electronic and hard copy format and did not hold the requested information. That position was maintained following an internal review carried out at the Appellant’s request, leading to the Appellant complaining to the Information Commissioner about the way his information request had been handled. 5. The Information Commissioner, having investigated the matter, issued the Decision Notice, in which she decided that, on the balance of probabilities the Department did not hold the requested information at the time when it received the information request. She expressed herself satisfied, on the basis of information and explanations provided by the Department, that it had conducted a thorough search, based on a set of search terms that were appropriate in the circumstances, and had not succeeded in locating a copy of the report. 6. The Department’s explanations, on which this assessment was based, had been set out in a single letter, written to the Information Commissioner on 24 October 2016 and responding to a number of questions which the Information Commissioner had posed. In answer to a question as to what searches had been carried out the Department stated: “Searches were conducted across [the Department’s] paper records, across the Department’s electronic records management system, Alfresco, and older legacy electronic records. The Department’s Records Management (RM) team also searched listings of SECRET and TOP SECRET records – these records are not held in Alfresco, which holds information classified below SECRET.“[The Department] underwent a major IT transformation between 2012 and 2015. All of the shared drives across the department were closed and information was transferred into Alfresco, our new RM system, as were records from Matrix, the electronic RM system previously used by the Department. If the information was held electronically, it would now be held in Alfresco or as a legacy record.” The same letter set out the search terms that had been used to: (a) search metadata relating to paper files - the metadata was said to be held on Alfresco “alongside fully electronic records”; (b) SECRET and TOP SECRET records; and (c) The electronic records held on Alfresco. 7. The Department’s letter went on to explain that the searches had led to the location of 5 paper files, which were searched manually without finding the withheld information. It also explained, in answer to a question by the Information Commissioner about its document retention policy and records, in the following terms: “[The Department] reviewed records in accordance with the Public Records Act (1958), using the Grigg methodology (i.e. reviewing records manually at 8 and 18 years) to identify records for transfer to The National Archives (TNA) under the 20 year rule. [The Department] reviewers completed reports on sets of files to be transferred to TNA and those decisions are verified and approved by TNA. Record review reports are stored in our electronic records management system and relevant information would have been identified by the searches described above had it existed.” 8. The Information Commissioner accepted those explanations without challenge and proceeded to record her decision. The Appeal to this Tribunal Written submissions and the first scheduled hearing 9. On 23 December 2016, the Appellant filed an Appeal against the Decision Notice with this Tribunal. 10. Appeals to this Tribunal are governed by FOIA section 58. Under that section we are required to consider whether a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner is in accordance with the law. We may also consider whether, to the extent that the Decision Notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Information Commissioner, she ought to have exercised his discretion differently. We may, in the process, review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based. 11. The Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal challenged the Information Commissioner’s finding. He suggested that, as newspapers had reported in 2004 that the Government of the day had decided that the report should at that stage remain confidential and not be published, it must have existed and must remain in existence. He also stated that the report was important, had cost the tax payer substantial sums to produce andthe investigation behind it had taken 4 years to complete. In those circumstances, he said, it was not open to the Department simply to claim that it could not find it. 12. The Information Commissioner submitted a written Response to the Appeal in which she said that the Grounds of Appeal did not set out any grounds for saying that the Decision Notice was not in accordance with the law. She argued that she had assessed the quality of the Department’s initial analysis of the information request, the scope of the search that it made on the basis of that analysis and the rigour and efficiency with which the search had then been conducted. 13. The Appellant opted to have the Appeal heard at a hearing rather than on the papers, which he was entitled to do. However, the Information Commissioner, as the Respondent, decided not to attend, but to rely on the terms of her written Response. 14. In the event, the Appellant was unwell on the day of the hearing and did not attend. However, we took the opportunity to discuss a number of concerns arising from our pre-reading of the agreed bundle of relevant documents that had been supplied. We were surprised that a document as important as a report on serious allegations levelled at a major corporation should have apparently simply been lost or destroyed without any record of its fate having been retained. This led us to look again at the Department’s explanation of the efforts made to locate the requested information and to conclude that, even had the Appellant been available, we would not have felt able to determine the Appeal without further information. Accordingly we adjourned the hearing and directed that the Department be joined as a party and should file evidence to explain the Department’s policy on the archiving and destruction of documents. The Case Management Directions that included those provisions were made on 19 April 2017. It recorded the concerns we had about the Department’s explanations (as summarised in paragraphs 6 and 7 above) in the following terms: “4. The points arising are as follows: 4.1 The Department has stated that its ""Alfresco"" records management system was interrogated in an attempt to locate the report referred to in the information request, but that this would not include any document marked ""secret"" or ""top secret"". The Department informed the Information Commissioner that it ""searched listings of SECRET and TOP SECRET records"". However, it is not clear to the Tribunal what form those ""listings"" took, in particular whether they were in paper or electronic form. Nor is it clear to us how the search of those materials was structured and performed. 4.2 The emphasis of the explanation provided to the Information Commissioner was on structured electronic searches of the ""Alfresco"" system, based on a number of keywords. A significantly less detailed explanation was provided of: 4.2.1. what the ""legacy electronic records"" consisted of or how they were searched; and 4.2.2. the ""paper records"" that were searched. 4.3 It is not clear to us whether any attempt was made, particularly in relation to the search in paper records, to: 4.3.1. identify, by inquiry of relevant staff members, whether the material was likely to be under the control of any particular group or individual (such as the individuals involved in the investigation); or4.3.2. focus the search (either as the result of such inquiries or otherwise) on the section of the Department responsible for Company Investigations or any members of staff known to have worked in that section at the time. 4.4 The Tribunal would like to know whether, at the relevant time, the Department operated a system under which any file or document that acquired prominence (because, for example, it had been mentioned on the floor of the House of Commons or in Committee) should be marked in any way to alert archivists and others to that status. In this case, of course, the investigation appears to have led to at least two requests for information under the Code of Practice that preceded the FOIA and at least one under FOIA itself, as well as having attracted considerable media attention. If any such ""marking"" was generally applied at the time, the Tribunal would like to have as much information as is still available about the system deployed and the impact it would be likely to have had on those considering retention of the BAT Report under the Public Records Act 1958. 4.5 It would assist the Tribunal to have more information on: 4.5.1. what is meant by the ""Grigg methodology"" apparently applied when considering documents under the Public Records Act; 4.5.2. the date on which the requested material was, or would have been, assessed; 4.5.3. what policy or general practice existed at the relevant time regarding the retention of section 447 reports generally; 4.5.4. what record was made, or would normally have been made, when a document as important as a Company Investigation Report was assessed for archiving or destruction; 4.5.5. the criteria applied when that assessment was carried out. 4.6 Would the possible need for information about a Company Investigation (which may presumably include the Report itself) to be made available to regulators and other, pursuant to section 449 of the Companies Act and the schedules referred to in it, have been taken into account on the occasion when archiving or destruction was under consideration and, if so, what is known about the impact of those criteria in this case? 4.7 Would it be normal for an Investigation Report involving a company of the size of BAT and allegations of criminality, which achieved some notoriety at the time (including potential impact on the selection of a Political Party leader), to be retained under the Public Records Act 1958 and, if so, can any explanation be provided for it having apparently disappeared in this case, with no record retained of its fate? 5. The Department should not feel itself constrained by the issues mentioned, but should review and expand on the information it provided to the Information Commissioner as it sees fit with a view to providing the Tribunal with the fullest explanation to enable it to determine the issue arising on this Appeal.” The joinder of the Department and the filing of evidence 15. After the Department had been joined as a party it arranged for two witness statements to be filed, one by Mr Paul Welch, the Department’s Records Officer and another by Mr Jonathan McGurk, the Head of the Technical Team within the Investigation and Enforcement Services division of the Insolvency Service.16. Mr Welch explained that in 2006 responsibility for Companies Investigation was transferred to the Insolvency Service. Although the Insolvency Service is an Executive Agency of the Department it has its own information and communication technology systems that are not accessible by officials in the Department who are not part of the Insolvency Service. These facts had been overlooked when the Appellant submitted his information request, with the result that no search was carried out in the records of the Insolvency Service at that time. However, after the Department heard that an appeal to this Tribunal had been launched, it decided, in January 2017, to establish whether it was possible that relevant information was held by the Insolvency Service. The enquiries nevertheless appear to have progressed at a leisurely pace, because the Department had not informed the Information Commissioner or the Appellant of the inadequacy of its original research by the date of the first scheduled hearing of the Appeal or the issuing of the Tribunals Case Management Directions. Nor had the Department disclosed that it had by that time established that in the past the Insolvency Service had held 53 boxes of physical case records which appeared to have had some relevance to the Report, but that they had been destroyed in stages from 2007 onwards. 17. Mr Welch also described the steps taken by the Department to investigate the transfer to the Insolvency Service and/or destruction of all 53 boxes. Neither the Department nor the Insolvency Service had been able to confirm whether the requested information was contained within the boxes. Mr Welch also clarified the searches it had conducted in order to locate the requested information, in response to the issues raised by us in the Case Management Directions. However, it is apparent that the searches were bound to have ended in failure, given what is now known about the location of any relevant information within the records held by the Insolvency Service. 18. Mr McGurk described the records management system maintained by the Insolvency Service since the boxes referred to above were first archived in 2005. It recorded the archiving of the boxes, the fact that the Report was contained in them, their periodic review for destruction and final destruction some years before the Appellant submitted his information request. Mr McGurk also explained that none of the individuals who conducted the investigation into BAT were still employed within the Insolvency Service and therefore available to throw any further light on the possible retention of any copies of the Report outside the official records management system. He did, however, provide explanations in response to the points raised in paragraphs 4.3 to 4.6 of the Case Management Directions. The Appellant raised no more objection or challenge to those explanations than he did to any other element of the either witness statement. In light of the clear explanation given about the fate of all 53 boxes, we accept Mr McGurk’s evidence on those points also. The Second Hearing 19. The Department was represented at the re-convened hearing on 26 September 2017 by Jennifer Thelen of counsel. Mr Khosravi represented himself and both he and members of the panel were provided with the opportunity to ask the witnesses questions. As mentioned, Mr Khosravi did not challenge the veracity of what either witness said in either his questioning or his oral submissions during the hearing. Instead, he simply explained his belief that he had been a victim of corruption in respect of BAT’s activities and stressed the importance of the Report being madepublic. He did not wish to make any point about the manner in which searches had been carried out but simply reiterated that, against the background of corrupt practice it should not be permissible for the government to claim that no copy of the Report could be found. He believed that it still existed. 20. Ms Thelen for the Department argued that a fair review of the steps taken to locate a copy of the Report should lead us to conclude that, on the balance of probabilities the Department no longer held a copy of it. There was, she said, no evidence pointing the other way and the evidence on the attempts to locate the Report was clear, consistent and unchallenged. Our Decision 21. We share the Appellant’s surprise that no copy of a document, having the importance and notoriety of the Report, should have been retained. It was for this reason that we made arrangements to be provided with more information than the one letter of explanation on which the Information Commissioner relied. In the event, we have been provided with a considerable body of evidence which demonstrates the shallowness of the information set out in that letter. However, the evidence also demonstrates that a thorough and properly targeted search was conducted, once it had become apparent that it was the Insolvency Service and not the Department that was likely to hold the information. The evidence also demonstrates to our satisfaction that no copy of the Report was located. This leads us to conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, the Department did not hold a copy of the Report at the date when the Appellant submitted his request for information. 22. It follows that the Information Commissioner was entitled to conclude as she did in her Decision Notice, (even though it is now apparent that she reached her decision on the basis of inaccurate and incomplete evidence) and that the Appeal should therefore be dismissed. 23. Our decision is unanimous. Signed Judge Chris Ryan Date: 08 January 2018"

SUBSTITUTE DECISION NOTICE Public Authority: West London Mental Health NHS Trust Complainant: Christopher Phillips The Substitute Decision For the reasons set out below the Public Authority did not deal with the Complainant’s request for information dated 5 December 2015 in accordance with Part I of the FOIA in that they ought to have confirmed or denied in writing to the Complainant whether they held any information about the death of Tahir Gass. Action Required The Public Authority must so confirm or deny by 25 August 2017. HH Judge Shanks 28 July 2017 2Appeal No: EA/2017/0003 REASONS FOR DECISION 1. On 9 November 1954 Tahir Gass, a Somali sailor born in 1920, was found guilty of murder but insane and sent to Broadmoor. He was discharged and repatriated to British Somaliland a year later, leaving Southampton on a boat bound for Aden on 11 October 1955. These are matters of public record. 2. In 1998 another Somali sailor, Mahmood Mattan, who had been hanged for murder in 1952, had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal. There was reference to Mr Gass’s case in press coverage of Mr Mattan’s. The press recorded that it was not known if Mr Gass was still alive. 3. On 5 December 2015 the Appellant, Dr Phillips, made a request under FOIA addressed to the West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which is responsible for Broadmoor, asking for information about Mr Gass. Dr Phillips acknowledged that normally in the absence of any other information it would be assumed that Mr Gass was still alive until 100 years after his birth and he asked, among other things, for “any information held about [Mr Gass’s] death”. In subsequent correspondence he confined his request to that information alone. The Trust has refused to say whether or not they hold any such information, relying on section 40(5)(b)(i) of FOIA, and the Information Commissioner has upheld that position in her decision notice dated 14 December 2016. 4. Dr Phillips has appealed against the decision notice. The parties agreed to the appeal being determined without a hearing and we consider that we can properly determine the issues in that way. 5. It is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions. Section 1(1) of FOIA, which is subject to section 2 among others, provides: Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled- (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and 3Appeal No: EA/2017/0003 (b) if that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. Section 2 provides: (1) Where any provision … states that the duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to any information, the effect of the provision is that where either- (a) the provision confers absolute exemption or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information section 1(1)(a) does not apply. … (3) For the purposes of this section, the following provisions … (and no others) are to be regarded as conferring absolute exemption: … (f) in section 40- (i) subsection (1) (ii) subsection (2) [in certain cases which are immaterial] (g) section 41 … Section 40(5) provides as far as relevant: (5) The duty to confirm or deny – (b) does not arise in relation to … information if or to the extent that … (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles … Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 defines “personal data” as data which relate to an identifiable “living individual”. The data protection principles are set out in Schedule 1 to the Act and define the circumstances in which personal data can be disclosed or otherwise processed. 6. Dr Phillips’s case is disarmingly simple. He says that if the answer to his request is that the Trust do hold information about Mr Gass’s death, any such information will 4Appeal No: EA/2017/0003 by definition not be “personal data” and no question of a contravention of the data protection principles will be involved in the confirmation that they hold the information (or indeed in the disclosure of the information itself). If, on the other hand, they do not hold such information, confirmation that that is the case will disclose nothing about Mr Gass and therefore not amount to his personal data and not be capable of involving a contravention of the data protection principles. 7. The Respondents answer this by saying in effect that to engage with the request at all by giving a confirmation or denial would imply that Mr Gass had been under the care of the Trust at some time. That in itself would be his “personal data”, indeed his “sensitive personal data”, since the fact that an individual has been under the care of a Mental Health NHS Trust is clearly information “as to his mental health” (see section 2 of Data Protection Act 1998). The disclosure of such personal data would inevitably involve a contravention of the first data protection principle, which requires, apart from anything else, that one of the conditions in Schedule 3 to the Data Protection Act is met. 8. This is a nice intellectual conundrum in a notoriously difficult area, namely the interaction between FOIA and the Data Protection Act. On consideration we have come down in favour of the Appellant’s argument. It seems to us that for section 40(5)(b) to bite either confirmation or denial has to involve a putative contravention of a data protection principle. In this case, confirmation clearly will not, since it is inherent in a confirmation that the putative data subject is dead, and so not a data subject at all. But a bare denial that the Trust holds any information about Mr Gass’s death does not logically tell anyone anything at all; the fact that the Trust does not have any information about his death does not in itself mean they have other information about him or that he was once a patient. As a matter of fact we know that to be the case from publicly available information but by denying holding any information about Mr Gass’s death the Trust would not be confirming that this was so. In the particular circumstances of this case we are therefore of the view that the Respondents are wrong to say that the duty to confirm or deny did not arise. 5Appeal No: EA/2017/0003 9. At the very end of her Response the Commissioner also raises the exemption at section 41(2) of FOIA as an exemption that may be engaged in this case. Section 41(2) says this: The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if … the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) constitute an actionable breach of confidence There is case law to suggest that disclosure of information about physical and mental health can be the subject of an actionable breach of confidence even when it relates to a dead person. So, confirmation that the Trust held information about Mr Gass’s death would imply that he had once been a patient and thus be a potential actionable breach of confidence which would mean that section 41(2) would be engaged even though Mr Gass was dead. However, the fact that Mr Gass was a patient of the Trust (as opposed to any of the details of his condition or treatment) is, as we have said, publicly available information and therefore not information which could in any circumstances be the subject of a breach of confidence action. For that reason we are quite satisfied that section 41(2) would not apply in this case any more than section 40(5)(b)(i). 10. For those reasons we are unanimously of the view that the Trust ought to have given the confirmation or denial required by section 1(1)(a) and we allow the appeal and issue the substitute decision notice set out above.

The Information Commissioner did not appear. Cumbria County Council was represented by Mr Ben Spencer. © CROWN COPYRIGHT 2017DECISION 1. The appeal is dismissed. 5 REASONS Background to Appeal 2. On 12 March 2016, the Appellant made a request to Cumbria County Council in the following terms: “(in relation to Hayton Woods 117000/320) 10 If counsel’s opinion is held on this issue then please supply a copy of the full opinion and of counsel’s instructions”. 3. The Council refused the information request in reliance upon s. 42 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) because it considered that the information requested attracted legal professional privilege. On internal review, it 15 considered that the applicable disclosure regime was the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“EIRs”) and confirmed that it was withholding the requested information under regulation 12 (5) (b). 4. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FER0634202 on 18 October 2016, upholding the Council’s decision. She decided that the EIRs was the 20 applicable regime for consideration of disclosure of the requested information, that regulation 12 (5) (b) was engaged, but that the balance of public interest favoured withholding the information. Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 31 October 2016 relied on grounds that 25 (a) the Decision Notice was wrong in law for having characterised the information requested as concerned with “planning” whereas it was actually concerned with the registration of a public right of way, and this subject-matter did not engage regulation 12 (5) (b) as it was not concerned with the “course of justice”, although he did not dispute that the EIRs were the applicable regime; (b) the conduct of County Council 30 officers was such that it was inappropriate for them to rely on legal professional privilege in this case; (c) that legal professional privilege had been waived by the Council; (d) the balance of public interest favours disclosure in all the circumstances. 6. By the time of the hearing, only grounds (c) and (d) were pursued by the Appellant. This was confirmed in the Appellant’s amended skeleton argument dated 35 28 March 2017. We have, accordingly, not considered grounds (a) and (b) in this Decision. 27. The Information Commissioner’s Response dated 7 December 2016 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. In response to grounds (c) and (d) relied upon by the Appellant, she submitted as follows. 8. The Decision Notice states at [23] that “the substance of the advice has not been 5 made public or lost the quality of confidentiality”. The Appellant’s argument in respect of waiver was that the terms of the Committee Report had waived privilege by stating “Expert legal advice has been sought from counsel on the matter and counsel has confirmed that this is an appropriate way to proceed”. The Information Commissioner submitted that this statement did not reveal in any meaningful way the 10 content of the underlying advice and that the Decision Notice was correct to conclude that the Council’s privilege had not been waived. 9. In respect of the public interest balancing exercise, the Information Commissioner submitted that there were no special or unusual circumstances in this case which weighed particularly strongly in favour of disclosure of otherwise 15 privileged information so as to outweigh the very considerable weight to be afforded to the inherent public interest in maintaining the system of legal professional privilege. 10. Cumbria County Council’s Response supported the Information Commissioner’s analysis. It denied that privilege had been waived by the terms of the 20 Committee Report, and submitted that the balance of public interest favoured maintaining the exception to disclosure. 11. The Tribunal conducted an oral hearing by video conference. Neither party called evidence so the matter proceeded on the basis of submissions only. There was no closed session. No authorities bundle was provided but both parties referred us to 25 legal authorities (see Submissions below). The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence, including submissions and skeleton arguments made by both the parties appearing before us. The Tribunal also considered a closed bundle which contained Counsel’s Advice obtained by the Council but did not contain (for reasons which were unclear) the instructions to counsel. 30 The Law 12. The EIRs define “environmental information” as follows: “..any information in written...form on – (a) The state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites… 35 (b) Factors such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste,…emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); (c) Measures (including administrative measures) such as policies, 40 legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities 3affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b)as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements; …” 13. The EIRs set out exceptions to the duty to disclose environmental information 5 as follows: “12 (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information requested if – (a) an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in 10 maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. 12 (2) A public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure.” 14. The category of exception relied upon in this case is regulation 12 (5) (b) which 15 provides that: “for the purposes of paragraph 1 (a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect – (b)the course of justice…..” 15. The phrase “the course of justice” has been held to provide an exception which 20 is broadly similar in scope to the exemption provided by s. 42 FOIA, which protects from disclosure information subject to legal professional privilege. We consider the case law in relation to the parties’ submissions below. Powers of the Tribunal 16. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of 25 FOIA (as applied by regulation 18 EIRs), as follows: “If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers - (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or 30 (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal 35 shall dismiss the appeal. On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.” 417. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. 5 Submissions 18. Mr Holmes and Mr Spencer both very fairly accepted that they were unfamiliar with the system of precedent in tribunals, with the effect that they had not appreciated that this Tribunal is bound by decisions of the Upper Tribunal but not by decisions of the First-tier Tribunal, which turn on their own facts and do not create precedent. 10 19. Nevertheless, on the question of waiver of privilege, Mr Holmes relied on the decision of a First-tier Tribunal in Kirkaldie v Information Commissioner and Thanet District Council EA/2006/001, in which the Tribunal concluded at [41]: “The Tribunal has compared Councillor Kirby’s reply with the full text of Counsel’s Advice provided to the Tribunal in confidence. The Tribunal finds 15 that the basis on which the advice had been sought and the main opinion given in that advice were mentioned by Councillor Kirby at the public meeting”. He submitted that the terms in which Counsel’s Advice had been mentioned in the Committee Report in this case (see paragraph 8 above) had similarly waived legal professional privilege by revealing the main opinion given. Mr Spencer, on behalf of 20 the Council, denied that the terms of the Committee Report in this case created a waiver and noted that the Councillor in the Kirkaldie case went significantly further than in this case. 20. Both parties referred us to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in GW v The Information Commissioner, The Local Government Ombudsman and Sandwell 25 Metropolitan Borough Council [2014] UKUT 0130, in which Judge Turnbull had considered whether legal professional privilege had been waived in different circumstances but decided that the terms of the communications between the Council and the Ombudsman had done “…no more than to summarise the effect of the Advice. They did not cross the line into setting out or summarising the contents of all or part 30 of the Advice” and accordingly found that privilege had not been waived. Judge Turnbull decided in that case that “ ..in the light of the virtually absolute nature of LPP in English Law…the course of justice would be adversely affected by disclosure”. 21. Mr Spencer helpfully updated the Tribunal to confirm that the legal proceedings 35 which it had considered to be likely when the information request was made were now firmly on foot, with the Administrative Court having given permission for a judicial review. The advice from Counsel which comprised the withheld information was, he submitted, in these circumstances far from stale and related to live legal proceedings. He submitted that this situation strongly favoured maintaining the 40 exception and that the disclosure of advice subject to legal professional privilege would adversely affect the course of justice. 522. In respect of the balance of public interest argument, Mr Holmes made some forceful criticisms of the Council’s process in relation to the registration of the footpath. He stopped short of alleging illegality, but in writing he alleged “unorthodoxy” and in oral submissions “shameful and improper conduct” by Council 5 officers in their conduct of the administrative process leading up to the Council Members’ decision. He submitted that this conduct was such that the public interest favoured disclosure to allow certainty as to whether the assertion made in the Committee Report was true and to demonstrate whether the Council officers were acting with integrity. In answer to a question from the Tribunal, Mr Holmes stated 10 that he did not think it would be disadvantageous to the Council to release its legal advice and that the Claimant in the Judicial Review Proceedings would not be assisted by it. 23. Mr Spencer told the Tribunal that the allegations of impropriety made by Mr Holmes were rejected by the Council and that “the rights of the Council and its 15 officers arising from this public statement are reserved”. Conclusion 24. We are satisfied that the information requested was correctly considered under the EIRs as it is information “on” a measure affecting land. The request was, boldly, for disclosure of information subject to legal professional privilege. That does not 20 serve automatically to engage the exception, but we note that the advice concerned was obtained in relation to a contentious decision and that, at the time of the request, judicial review proceedings were considered likely. Those proceedings are now in train so the advice remains of value. We acknowledge the strength of the arguments for obtaining and holding confidential legal advice in such circumstances and we are 25 satisfied that the information requested in this case touches on “the course of justice” so as to engage regulation 12 (5) (b) EIRs. 25. Turning first to the Appellant’s submission that the Council had waived its privilege by the manner in which the legal advice it had obtained was referred to in the Committee Report, we agree with the Appellant that this is a question of fact to be 30 determined on the evidence before us. Following the approach of the First-tier Tribunal in Kirkaldie (see paragraph 19 above) we have read the withheld material contained in our Closed Bundle and we are satisfied that the very brief reference to the effect of Counsel’s Advice in the Committee report cannot be described as a summary of the totality of advice given by Counsel. In the circumstances, we agree 35 with the Decision Notice that the substance of the advice has not been made public or lost the quality of confidentiality and we have no hesitation in upholding the Decision Notice to the extent of rejecting the Appellant’s case that the Council waived its privilege. 26. With regard to the balance of public interest which falls to be applied under 40 regulation 12 (1) (b) EIRs, we agree with the Decision Notice’s assessment at paragraphs 27 to 34 of the factors to be taken into account on both sides of the balancing exercise. The presumption of disclosure in the EIRs means that we do not start with the scales weighted evenly but with some weight on the side of disclosure. 627. The Appellant’s case is that the weight in favour of disclosure is to be increased by the impropriety of Council officers. He has undertaken a forensic analysis of the Committee Reports and has been able to point to several inadequacies of evidence and inconsistencies of approach. He appears to rely on an allegation of bias but his 5 allegations relate to the Council officers only and not to the Council Members who took the relevant decision. 28. Whilst we agree with the Appellant that a case involving corruption or serious impropriety would give added weight to the case for disclosure, we note that there is no evidence before us of a complaint being made to the relevant authorities, nor of 10 any on-going criminal or disciplinary proceedings, nor of any relevant findings of impropriety in relation to the conduct the Appellant relies on. Our assessment is that the evidence of alleged impropriety in this case consists entirely of the Appellant’s bare assertions. We note that he did not seek to give sworn evidence and he did not file a witness statement containing a statement of truth, but merely made submissions. 15 We remind ourselves that the Appellant bears the burden of proof to satisfy us on the balance of probabilities of his case and we conclude that we are not satisfied on the evidence before us and to the relevant standard of proof that there is a serious cause for concern here which deserves to be considered in the public interest balancing exercise. 20 29. On the side of maintaining the exception is the considerable weight of the decision of a Three Judge Panel of the Upper Tribunal, chaired by the then-Senior President of Tribunals, in DCLG v Information Commissioner & WR [2012] UKUT 103 (AAC) (referred to at paragraph 24 of the Decision Notice), underlining the importance of the system of legal professional privilege to a fair and proper judicial 25 process. Mr Holmes’ submission that there would be no injustice to the Council in releasing its legal advice to the world at large (which would be the effect of disclosure under FOIA or EIRs) was, we found, a surprising one for a retired solicitor. The Upper Tribunal considered in DCLG that weight should be attributed not only to the need to maintain legal professional privilege in that case (where Judicial review 30 proceedings had also been threatened) but also to the more generalised risk that disclosure would weaken the confidence of public bodies and their advisers in the efficacy of the system of legal professional privilege. 30. We agree with the Decision Notice that, in the circumstances of this case, the course of justice would be adversely affected by the disclosure of the Council’s legal 35 advice because it would place the Council at a disadvantage in legal proceedings which were reasonably anticipated at the time of the request and have since come to pass. We also find that the public interest generally favours maintaining the exception so as to withhold from disclosure information subject to legal professional privilege. There may be exceptions to that approach, but we are not satisfied that this is such a 40 case. 31. For the above reasons, we discern no error of law in the Decision Notice and this appeal is dismissed. 7(Signed) ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 9 May 2017 5 PRINCIPAL JUDGE 8"

The appeal is allowed. The Decision Notice is set aside and substituted by this 5 Decision. The steps in paragraph 2 below are to be taken by the Cabinet Office. 2. The Cabinet Office is required to release a redacted copy of the withheld minutes to the Appellant, so that only item 3, paragraph 4 headed “National Defence Medal” may be read. REASONS 10 Background to Appeal 3. The Appellant is involved with a campaign for the Government to create a National Defence Medal (“NDM”), to honour veterans who did not participate in a specific conflict but who stood ready to do so as members of the Armed Forces. This would include those who were conscripted into the Armed Forces after the Second 15 World War. Other Commonwealth countries, such as New Zealand and Australia confer such a medal for service of three and four years respectively. United States veterans are awarded a similar medal after three years’ service. In the United Kingdom, length of service is recognised only after fifteen years. 4. The Honours and Decorations Committee (“HDC”) is the permanent standing 20 committee of the Cabinet Office which provides advice to the Sovereign regarding honours, decorations and medals. Its terms of reference are: To consider general questions relative to the grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals; to review the scales of award, both civil and military, from time to time; to consider questions of new awards and changes in the conditions 25 governing existing awards. 5. In April 2012 the Prime Minister appointed Sir John Holmes to conduct an independent review of policy concerning medals, including consideration of the case for a National Defence Medal. Sir John recommended that the case for a NDM should ultimately be considered by the HDC, which should then make a recommendation to 30 government. Following that process, a written Ministerial Statement was issued on 29 July 2014 to the effect that the HDC “was not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time, but has advised that this issue might usefully be reconsidered in the future”. The HDC considered the matter again at a meeting in February 2015. 35 6. On 8 April 2015 the Appellant made a request to the Cabinet Office for minutes of the HDC. His request was in the following terms: Perhaps you could also pass on (under the FOI Act) a request to see the minutes of the HD Committee meeting which reached this conclusion. At least we will then be able to address the perceived weaknesses in the case, and you can stop 40 fielding the same questions. 27. The Cabinet Office refused the Appellant’s information request in reliance upon s. 37 (1) (b) and s. 35 (1) (a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). 8. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50588594 on 1 March 2016, upholding the Cabinet Office’s reliance on s. 37 (1) (b) of FOIA. The 5 Decision Notice found (at paragraph 13) that the exemption under s. 37 (1) (b) was engaged by the request and (at paragraph 25) that the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption “by a narrow margin”. The Decision Notice expressly did not consider the Cabinet Office’s reliance on s. 35 (1) (b). Appeal to the Tribunal 10 9. The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 27 March 2016 relied on grounds principally concerned with the balance of public interest test and argued strongly that the public interest favoured transparency and disclosure. He very fairly accepted that the requested minutes may need to be redacted so as not to impact on any individuals. He enclosed a report from the United Kingdom National Defence Medal Campaign 15 and a copy of its official submission to the government. 10. The Information Commissioner’s Response to the appeal dated 29 April 2016 maintained the analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. It did not refer to s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA at all. 11. The Cabinet Office’s Response dated 28 June 2016 generally supported the 20 stance taken by the Information Commissioner. It was also asserted at paragraph 18 that, even if the Tribunal were to take a different view from the Information Commissioner as to disclosure under s. 37 (1) (b) of FOIA, the information requested would still not be disclosable because s. 35 (1) (a) would apply. We consider that argument in our conclusions below. 25 12. The Appellant replied to both Responses, emphasising the public interest in transparency and disclosure in relation to the honours system, and suggesting that the HDC was not truly independent. That is not of course a matter on which the Tribunal may adjudicate. 13. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for 30 determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. 14. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising some 200 pages, including submissions made by all parties, for which we were grateful. We also considered a closed bundle, consisting of the withheld information only. 35 15. The Tribunal initially convened on 27 September 2016, but adjourned without determining the appeal and directed further submissions from the parties. The Tribunal re-convened on 10 January 2017 to consider the submissions made and reach its decision. The Legal Framework 316. The duty of a public authority to disclose requested information is set out in s.1 (1) of FOIA. The exemptions to this duty are referred to in section 2 (2) as follows: “In respect of any information which is exempt information by virtue of any provision of Part II, section 1 (1) (b) does not apply if or to the extent that – 5 (a) the information is exempt information by virtue of a provision conferring absolute exemption, or (b) in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.” 10 17. The categories of exemption which were initially relied upon under FOIA in this case are: s. 35 (1) (a) and s.37 (1) (b). These exemptions are both so-called qualified exemptions, giving rise to the public interest balancing exercise required by s. 2 (2) (b). 18. Section 35 (1) (a) FOIA provides as follows: 15 “(1) Information held by a government department…is exempt information if it relates to – (a) The formulation or development of government policy”. 19. Section 37 (1) (b) FOIA provides that: 20 “(1) Information is exempt information if it relates to – (b) the conferring by the Crown of any honour or dignity”. 20. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: “(1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal consider - 25 (a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 30 the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on 35 which the notice in question was based.” 21. The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Information Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of discretion rests with the Appellant. The standard of proof to be applied by the 40 Tribunal is the balance of probabilities. Scope of the Request 422. It seems to us that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the information request as to which HDC minutes were being requested. It is possible to read the request, in context, as being one for the minutes of the HDC which considered the matter in accordance with Sir John’s recommendations and preceded the written 5 Ministerial Statement as to its conclusions. The HDC minutes which the Information Commissioner considered and which were included in the closed bundle for the Tribunal were from a meeting which took place some months later in February 2015, after the written Ministerial Statement and at which HDC had discussed further correspondence on the subject of the NDM (open bundle page 161). 10 23. The Information Commissioner and the Cabinet Office responded to our enquiry about this by confirming that the closed material which we had before us was the correct document. Considering the ambiguity in the request and applying the balance of probabilities standard, we find this to be a reasonable understanding and we do not consider that the Decision Notice was erroneous in this regard. We note 15 that it is still open to the Appellant to make a more clearly-worded request for the minutes of the earlier HDC meeting should he choose. 24. The Decision Notice concludes at paragraph 11 that the requested minutes cover more than one issue. However, we take the view that the request (set out at paragraph 6 above) is, properly understood, much narrower in scope than the Information 20 Commissioner understood it to be. We therefore conclude that the Decision Notice was erroneous in its findings as to the scope of the Appellant’s request. 25. We understand the request to be limited to the specific section of the HDC minutes which dealt with the NDM. We take this view on a plain reading of the request, taken in the context of the exchange of correspondence on 8 April 2015 25 (pages 160 to 161 of the open bundle). The official from the Honours and Appointments Secretariat states in his letter to the Appellant that the HDC members remain unpersuaded of the case for an NDM at this time and the Appellant replies with a request for the minutes of the committee which reached this conclusion. It does not seem to us that the information request is concerned with the HDC’s wider 30 work or with the minutes of the HDC in relation to any other issue. We note that the Appellant envisaged and accepted in his Notice of Appeal that there may be other matters contained in the HDC minutes which should be redacted. 26. We conclude that the scope of the request is limited to item 3, paragraph 4 of the February HDC minutes contained in our closed bundle, headed “National Defence 35 Medal”. We have therefore considered the engagement of the exemption under s. 37 (1) (b) in respect of that paragraph alone. Engagement of s.37 (1) (b) 40 27. When we adjourned on 27 September 2016, we directed the parties to make submissions on the question of whether the s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA exemption was engaged in relation to the conferral of existing Honours and Dignities only, or 5whether its scope also extended to the creation of a new Honour or Dignity. The Information Commissioner submitted that the exemption refers to both existing and proposed Honours and Dignities, and referred us to the Commissioner’s own published guidance to that effect. The Cabinet Office submitted that the wording of s. 5 37 (1) (b) FOIA was deliberately broad and that the word “any” is all-encompassing, so that the natural reading of the section was wide enough to include “all honours, past and future”. It refers us to archived Ministry of Justice Guidance which supports this view. The Appellant submitted that an Honour or Dignity cannot be conferred by the Crown if it does not exist. 10 28. We share the Appellant’s concern as to the scope of s. 37 (1) (b). If the exemption was in respect of information that merely related to any Honour or Dignity then the creation of a new award would be caught. However, Parliament chose to use the words “conferring by the Crown” in this section of FOIA. The meaning of “conferring” is “the act of bestowing”. We appreciate the policy behind the 15 exemption and note that the public interest balancing exercise tends to refer to the need to protect confidences, and to ensure candour in the recommendation process, but such considerations do not seem to us to be relevant in relation to a medal which does not exist and so cannot be conferred. 29. The Cabinet Office submitted that, were we to take the view that s. 37 (1)(b) 20 were not engaged by information pertaining to the creation of a new medal, that this view would be inconsistent with previous decisions of the Information Commissioner and of the First-tier Tribunal. We acknowledge this to be the case, but remind the parties that differently-constituted panels of the First-tier Tribunal are not bound by each other’s decisions and are at liberty to disagree with each other and indeed with 25 the Information Commissioner. 30. The Cabinet Office and Information Commissioner also submitted that the guidance issued by ICO and the Ministry of Justice was relevant in interpreting FOIA. We found the guidance useful but we do not consider that it is strictly appropriate to rely on it in interpreting a statutory provision as it does not meet the criteria for the 30 use of extrinsic materials as an aid to interpretation set out by the House of Lords in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart [1992] UKHL 31. We note that the IC’s guidance is in itself somewhat ambiguous in referring to “new awards2”. This could be understood to refer to the conferral of a new award on an individual, rather than the creation of a new Honour. 35 31. Having considered the issue carefully, we have concluded that the exemption under s.37 (1) (b) is not engaged by information relating to a proposed new medal. We conclude that Parliament’s use of the word “conferring” in s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA is intended to relate to Honours and Dignities which already exist and so may be “conferred”. Having reached this conclusion, we have not found it necessary to go on 1 http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/3.html 2 https://ico.org.uk/media/for- organisations/documents/1194/communications_with_her_majesty_and_the_awarding_of_honours.pdf 6to consider the relevant public interest arguments. We note that the Decision Notice (paragraph 25) described that issue as “finely balanced”. Engagement of s. 35 (1) (a) 32. The Decision Notice did not reach any conclusions as to the engagement of s. 5 35 (1) (a) FOIA. The Cabinet Office has suggested that we may nevertheless decide to withhold the disputed information in reliance upon s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA. 33. We have considered carefully whether it would be within the scope of our powers under s. 58 FOIA (see paragraph 20 above) for us to determine here whether the withheld information engaged the s.35 (1) (a) exemption and, if so, whether the 10 balance of public interest favoured disclosure. We note that, despite the apparently limiting terms in which the scope of s. 58 FOIA is expressed, the nature of a First-tier Tribunal hearing has been described as de novo, so that we “stand in the shoes”3 of the Information Commissioner and can make any decision that she could have made. That would suggest that we do have power to consider at this stage the exemption on 15 which the Cabinet Office originally relied but which was not adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner. 34. We note that this is not a question of whether to allow the public authority to rely on a completely new exemption, which was the situation considered by the Court of Appeal in the context of the Environmental Information Regulations in Birkett v 20 DEFRA [2011] EWCA (Civ) 16064. In that case, the Tribunal’s own case management powers were prayed in aid in ensuring that the Appellant would not be surprised by a new argument at the last minute. In this case, the Appellant was on notice that s.35 (1) (a) FOIA was at issue when he made his complaint to the Information Commissioner, but he has understandably been left in the position of 25 considering it no longer to be relevant, due to the Information Commissioner’s non- determination of that issue. We wonder whether it is fair and just in those circumstances for the Cabinet Office to be allowed to revert to its pre-Decision Notice reliance on that exemption? We note that the Cabinet Office has not appealed against the Decision Notice on the basis that it’s initial reliance upon s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA 30 should have been adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner. It would have been open to it to do so. We are left with a situation where, as the Decision Notice did not reach a conclusion on that issue, none of the parties appear to have regarded s. 35 (1) (a) as being seriously in play in this appeal, with the effect that we have received limited argument on that issue. 3 See Guardian Newspapers Limited v IC and BBC, IT, 8 January 2007 (referred to in Coppell: Information Rights Law and Practice, Fourth Edition, 28-020; see also the discussion of the First-tier Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the Upper Tribunal’s decision in Birkett [2011] UKUT 39 AAC http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2011/39.html and in IC v Bell [2014] UKUT 0106 (AAC) at [22]. 4 http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1606.html 735. In all the circumstances, we express considerable reservations as to whether we are technically seized of the s. 35 (1) (a) issue, given that it did not feature in the Decision Notice against which we are considering an appeal. Alternatively, if we are seized of it in the exercise of our de novo jurisdiction, then we are concerned that it is 5 not fair and just to reach a determination on an issue which the Appellant was not properly fore-warned may feature in our conclusions. We regard the failure of the Decision Notice to determine a key issue between the parties as rather unsatisfactory, especially given that the Information Commissioner has concluded at least one other matter in relation to the NDM where her Decision Notice was in respect of s. 35 (1) 10 (a) FOIA5. We note that we have no power to remit the matter to the Information Commissioner for her further consideration before determining this appeal – see Information Commissioner v Bell [2014] UKUT 106 (AAC)6. 36. Notwithstanding our concern as to whether it is right to do so, we have set out below our findings in relation to s.35 (1) (a) FOIA. When considering the Cabinet 15 Office’s submission in relation to s. 35 (1) (a), we asked the parties in our adjournment directions to comment on whether government policy in relation to the NDM was still being formulated or developed at the time of the Appellant’s request. The Cabinet Office’s response to our query was that the phrase “might usefully be reconsidered in the future” contained in the Ministerial Statement meant that the 20 policy was left open and live. The Information Commissioner’s response was that the matter was unclear and that the Cabinet Office was better placed to assist the Tribunal. The Appellant submitted that the NDM is no longer under consideration and so there is no process of policy formulation to protect by withholding the requested information. 25 37. It does seem to us that, if it were the case that policy in relation to the NDM were still being formulated or developed, then s. 35 (1) (a) would be the most natural provision of FOIA to be engaged in relation to consideration of the creation of a completely new medal. We note that a differently-constituted panel of the First-tier Tribunal considered s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA in relation to the minuted discussion of the 30 NDM by HDC’s Advisory Military Sub-Committee in Halligan v IC and MOD EA/2015/0291. It was not disputed before that Tribunal that s. 35(1)(a) was engaged, although the Tribunal at paragraph [23] noted the arguments to the effect that policy development in relation to the NDM was no longer live. The Tribunal in that case decided that the public interest did not favour maintaining the exemption and directed 35 that redacted minutes should be disclosed. 38. In the evidence and submissions before us in this appeal, we note that there is evidence that policy is still being formulated or developed. This is in the form of a letter from the Cabinet Office to the Information Commissioner (see p.190 of the open bundle) where it is stated: “policy in relation to the National Defence Medal was at 40 the time of the request, and continues to be, a live issue….”. 5 DN FS50584583, appealed to the Tribunal and mentioned in paragraph 37 of this Decision. 6 IC v Bell [2014] UKUT 0106 (AAC). 839. However, we also have evidence before us which would lead us to a contrary conclusion. This is the letter from the HDC Secretariat to the Appellant (see p.161 of the open bundle) which states: “there are no plans for further work on this issue”. 40. We also have before us evidence which we regard as ambiguous, namely the 5 written Ministerial Statement (see p.202 of the open bundle) which states: “The Committee on the grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals is not persuaded that a strong enough case can be made at this time, but has advised that this issue might usefully be reconsidered in the future”. 41. Applying the balance of probabilities test to the totality of the evidence, we 10 conclude that we cannot be satisfied on the evidence before us that it is more likely than not that policy in relation to the proposed NDM was still being formulated or developed at the time of the Appellant’s request. We are not persuaded by the Cabinet Office’s submission that the terms of the Ministerial Statement left the issue open. As the Information Commissioner did not reach a conclusion on that issue, we regard the 15 Cabinet Office, in seeking to rely on s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA, as bearing an evidential burden in relation to that issue. We find that this has not been discharged to the required standard. Conclusion 42. For the above reasons, we conclude that the Decision Notice was not in 20 accordance with the law. We find that (i) the scope of the Appellant’s request was narrower than the Decision Notice found it to be; (ii) that s. 37 (1) (b) FOIA is not engaged by the information request; (iii) we express doubt that it is open to us to reach a view as to s. 35 (1) (a) FOIA when it was not adjudicated upon by the Information Commissioner, but if we may properly do so, then we find that that exemption was not 25 engaged at the time of the request. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, and the Cabinet Office is required to take the steps set out at paragraph 2 above (Signed on the original) 30 ALISON MCKENNA DATE: 16 January 2017 PRINCIPAL JUDGE 9"

The appeal is dismissed. 5 REASONS Background to Appeal 2. The Appellant made a request to the Governing Body of the University of Cambridge (“the University”) on 11 June 2015 for information about its alumni associations. This was a subject about which they had corresponded previously and 10 both the University and the Information Commissioner had concluded that the Appellant had previously made vexatious requests, within the meaning given to that term by s. 14 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). 3. The University did not respond to the Appellant’s request of 11 June 2015, or to her request for an internal review, in reliance upon s.17 (6) of the Freedom of 15 Information Act 2000. This legislative provision permits a public authority to not respond to an information request where it regards that request as vexatious and where it has given the requester notice in relation to a previous request that it regarded it as vexatious and where it would be unreasonable in all the circumstances to expect the public authority to serve a further notice in respect of the current request. 20 4. The Information Commissioner issued Decision Notice FS50601710 on 9 March 2016, upholding the University’s decision. The Information Commissioner stated that she was satisfied both from the wording of the request and from previous dealings with the Appellant (this is the fifth Decision Notice involving this Appellant and the University) that the request was vexatious, that an appropriate notice had been 25 served and that it was not reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for the University to be required to respond to the request. Appeal to the Tribunal 5. The Appellant’s (undated) Notice of Appeal raises a considerable number of issues which are beyond the remit of the Tribunal in considering an appeal against a 30 Decision Notice (see “The Legal Framework” below). In particular, it is not possible for this Tribunal to re-open issues in relation to previous Decision Notices which were not appealed at the relevant time. It is also not possible for this Tribunal to give the Appellant advice as to how best to manage any future correspondence with the University. The Appellant does not appear to dispute that s. 17 (6) was engaged, 35 although she does dispute that her previous requests were vexatious. 6. Since the filing of her Notice of Appeal the Appellant has made further submissions which we have read but we find that they do not provide us with a legal basis for disturbing the Decision Notice under appeal. 27. The Information Commissioner’s Response dated 10 May 2016 maintained her analysis as set out in the Decision Notice. She submits that the only matter for the Tribunal to consider is whether she was correct to decide that the University was entitled to rely on s. 17 (6) FOIA. 5 8. The University’s Response dated 7 June 2016 concurs with the analysis of the Information Commissioner and sets out a brief history of its long-running pattern of correspondence with the Appellant. 9. The parties and the Tribunal agreed that this matter was suitable for determination on the papers in accordance with rule 32 of The Tribunal Procedure 10 (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended. The Tribunal considered an agreed open bundle of evidence comprising some 300 pages, including submissions made by all parties, for which we were grateful. The Legal Framework 10. Section 14 (1) and (2) of FOIA provides that: 15 (1) Section 1 (1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious. (2) Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for information which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a 20 reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request. 11. Section 17(5) and (6) of FOIA provide that: (5) A public authority which, in relation to any request for information, is relying on a claim that section 12 or 14 applies must, within the tie for 25 complying with section 1 (1), give the applicant a notice stating that fact. (6) Subsection (5) does not apply where – (a) the public authority is relying on a claim that section 14 applies, (b) the authority has given the applicant a notice, in relation to a previous request for information, stating that it is relying on such a claim, and 30 (c) it would in all the circumstances be unreasonable to expect the authority to serve a further notice under subsection (5) in relation to the current request. 12. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.58 of FOIA, as follows: (1) If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal consider - 35 3(a) that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or (b) to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently, 5 the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner, and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal. (2) On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on 10 which the notice in question was based. 13. We note that the burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Commissioner’s decision was wrong in law or involved an inappropriate exercise of 15 discretion rests with the Appellant. Conclusion 14. We agree with the Information Commissioner that the only matter we can consider in this appeal is whether the University was entitled to rely on s. 17 (6). We are concerned therefore primarily with matters of procedure. It is not open to us to 20 un-pick the University’s view that a previous request was vexatious. We note however that there is not a blanket ban on all correspondence and that the University would have to be satisfied that any future request from the Appellant was vexatious within the meaning given to that term by FOIA before being able to rely on s. 17 (6) in relation to any future request. We also note here that it is the request and not the 25 requester that must satisfy the statutory criteria for vexatiousness. 15. We find that the University did regard the previous request (dated 28 October 2014) as vexatious. That judgement was upheld by the Information Commissioner in a previous complaint but was not appealed to the Tribunal. We find that the University then served a notice on the Appellant (dated 11 November 2014) under s. 30 17 (5) FOIA. In those circumstances we find that it was entitled to rely on s. 17 (6) FOIA in not responding to the request of 11 June 2015. It informed the Appellant on 19 June 2015 that the request of 11 June raised matters that it had repeatedly addressed in the past. 16. We find that the Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice was correct in its 35 findings both of fact and law and for all these reasons we now dismiss the appeal.

Dated this 3rd day of December 2016 Judge Hughes [Signed on original] 2Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. FEP Heatcare Limited, the Appellant in these proceedings (“FEP”), is a company that supplies and services gas boilers in domestic premises. In the last two years it has changed its mode of marketing and began to use telemarketing to gain sales. This has resulted in a large number of complaints to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) about unsolicited phone calls. The Respondent in these proceedings, the Information Commissioner, is the Regulator responsible for enforcing the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003/2011. On 24 March 2015 he wrote to the Company Secretary of FEP setting out his powers, (including the possibility of issuing a monetary penalty notice of up to £500,000 for breach of the Regulations) and providing a breakdown of the complaints received by between 2 February and 25 February 2015. He drew attention to the duty to ensure compliance with the regulations lay with the instigator of the calls irrespective of the assurances provided by a data supplier and he asked for evidence of consent to make the calls to certain identified numbers, an explanation for the total number of complaints, steps the company would take to reduce the number of complaints received and information about the way the company operated. The letter drew attention to guidance freely available via the ICO website. 2. Mr Craig Bonnyman (signing as a Director of FEP) replied providing the letter of assurance it had received from its data supplier DWD, explaining that the company had recently expanded in size and in its marketing efforts and asserting it had a “rigid TPS Complaints procedure, which I personally oversee”. 3. The ICO responded on 9 April pointing out that TPS had received 26 valid complaints in a short period, reminding FEP of its responsibilities and seeking specific evidence concerning relevant matters. Mr Bonnyman responded by a phone call and letter of 29 April. He re-affirmed that he had assurances from the DWD that the recipients of the calls had opted in to receiving calls, but stated that he had not seen the evidence for this. He confirmed that: “In light of the situation described above, I felt it would be prudent for my company to take the preventative measure of 3Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 ceasing to make telemarketing calls as of 30.4.15 until we have sourced a data supplier who can supply all of the details”. 4. On 1 May 2015 the ICO notified Mr Bonnyman that it would, for a three month period, monitor the number of complaints against FEP and the fact of the monitoring would be published on the ICO website. By an email of 28 July Mr Bonnyman complained about this and asserted that the majority of complaints did not relate to his company’s activities. On 30 July the ICO responded to the email confirming that of 203 complaints to TPS relating to FEP between February and June 2015 42 related to a number not associated with FEP. The ICO relied on the other complaints as being made in response to calls from FEP. In a telephone conversation of 31 July he stated that FEP had stopped telemarketing on 7 May. 5. Solicitors acting for FEP wrote to the ICO on 31 July confirming that FEP had ceased telemarketing from 7 May and asserting that information on the ICO website was misleading and asking the ICO to acknowledge that FEP had ceased telemarketing and change its website in the light of this. On 10 August, the solicitors, in the light of adverse coverage of FEP in the Sunday Mail on the previous day, wrote again to the ICO protesting at the failure to change the ICO’s webpages and expressing concern “in relation to the potential impact that the publication of the article will have on its business activities and its commercial reputation.” 6. The ICO replied to FEP’s solicitors on 10 August explaining that the outcome of the monitoring would be considered around 15 August and would draw together various sources of information, including TPS data, the ICO’s own complaints information, information from telecommunications service providers:- “and also intelligence received which alleges that your client has taken steps to avoid detection when it makes direct marketing telephone calls or uses third parties to do so on its behalf. At that point we will determine whether it is appropriate to cease monitoring, to extend monitoring for a further period of time or to prepare a report in contemplation of recommending that regulatory action should be taken. At that point your client will obviously be entitled to make representations.” 7. Using his statutory powers the ICO obtained information about FEP’s operations from its service provider and on 25 August notified the solicitor and Mr Bonnyman of 4Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 issues with respect to compliance with Regulations 19 and 24; requiring the company to provide information, providing details of complaints the ICO had received. 8. FEP changed its solicitor and on 10 September 2015 its new representative provided significant explanations and admissions to the ICO. These included that Mr Craig Bonnyman had set up a new company on 7 May “in an effort to deal with marketing as a distinct and separate activity. Marketing staff who worked for FEP were transferred via TUPE to Centura [the new company]”. Subsequently calls were made intermittently, including automated calls. Centura had no evidence that the recipients of calls listed on 25 August had consented to the calls. “Regrettably Centura cannot guarantee that some data from … DWD was not also used to make calls.” The letter acknowledged that during February FEP had contacted individuals on the TPS register blaming deficiencies in the data supplied by DWD. The letter went on to explain steps which FEP and Centura intended to take in the future to ensure compliance with PECR. In a further letter of 8 October the solicitors detailed certain of the difficulties which the company faced and stated that:- “In a desperate effort to secure some form of cash flow, Mr Bonnyman looked to telemarketing, but admittedly naively stumbled into the telemarketing arena with a poor knowledge of the rules.” The letter asserted that FEP had obtained no commercial advantage from telemarketing. 9. On 27 October an officer of the ICO prepared a detailed Regulatory Action Recommendation Report detailing the history, and finding that between 6 April and 15 July FEP instigated 2,692,217 automated calls of which 934,176 connected and 1,758,041 failed to connect. During this period there had been 25 complaints of Regulation 21 contraventions to TPS and 94 complaints of Regulation 19 contraventions to ICO. In considering whether breaches of regulations were serious it noted the large number of calls, that 94 complaints had been received “although as FEP did not identify themselves in the messages it is unsurprising that not many people complained … their actions resulted in a serious contravention affecting many people… the fact that the calls also breach Regulation 24 appears to be indicative of FEP acting in such a way as to generate leads but deliberately frustrate any attempt to identify the maker of the automated calls” . In considering whether the contraventions were deliberate the report concluded that they were; noting the conduct of telemarketing after an assurance to the ICO that the company would no 5Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 longer conduct telemarketing and the failure to provide an identifier of the messages and using another company to mask the instigator of the marketing. It noted that FEP knew there was a risk of contravention as it had been notified that monitoring was in place following concerns about breaches of PECR, reasonable steps had not been taken to avoid contravention. The report noted that FEP had not lived up to its previous statements. The report noted the financial position of FEP from Companies House information. Following consideration of the report a decision was made to issue a monetary penalty at level D – £100,001-£250,000. A notice of intent to issue a monetary penalty notice on £180,000 was served on FEP. 10. FEP’s solicitors responded on 18 January stressing the financial hardship which would be caused. FEP had made a loss of £260,000 for the six months April-October 2015. They claimed that there had been embezzlement by an employee causing a loss calculated at £300,000 and the jobs of 13 employees were at risk if the penalty were imposed. FEP had made a considerable loss during the period of non-compliance with the regulations and accordingly had made no benefit from the non-compliance. There was no chance of further non-compliance from FEP. They argued that it had been a steep learning curve for FEP, its reputation had been adversely affected which would affect future business simply due to the ICO’s actions and accordingly no monetary penalty should be imposed. Details of the FEP’s position were disclosed through the provision of accounts and a balance sheet showing an excess of liabilities over assets. FEP had negotiated time to pay its liabilities to HMRC 11. Having considered these representations the ICO decided not to change the draft notice and on 14 March 2016 the ICO issued a monetary penalty notice against FEP in the sum of £180,000 (with the offer of a discount for early payment) in respect of breach of Regulation 19 of PECR which regulates the use of automated calling systems:- “19.—(1) A person shall neither transmit, nor instigate the transmission of, communications comprising recorded matter for direct marketing purposes by means of an automated calling system except in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (2). 6Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 (2) Those circumstances are where the called line is that of a subscriber who has previously notified the caller that for the time being he consents to such communications being sent by, or at the instigation of, the caller on that line. (3) A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention of paragraph (1). (4) For the purposes of this regulation, an automated calling system is a system which is capable of— (a)automatically initiating a sequence of calls to more than one destination in accordance with instructions stored in that system; and (b)transmitting sounds which are not live speech for reception by persons at some or all of the destinations so called.” 12. The notice set out the background, the previous advice given to FEP and monitoring of its performance, the subsequent identification of complaints about automated direct marketing calls from FEP which during the period 6 April 2015 to 15 July 2015 was responsible for 2,692,217 automated calls and had no evidence of the subscribers’ consent to receive those calls. The ICO found a breach of Regulation 19(1), that this was a serious breach, that these were deliberate actions. S55A (1) of the DPA which provides:- “(1)The Commissioner may serve a data controller with a monetary penalty notice if the Commissioner is satisfied that— (a)there has been a serious contravention of section 4(4) by the data controller, (b)the contravention was of a kind likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress, and (c)subsection (2) or (3) applies. (2)This subsection applies if the contravention was deliberate. (3)This subsection applies if the data controller— (a)knew or ought to have known — (i)that there was a risk that the contravention would occur, and (ii)that such a contravention would be of a kind likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress, but 7Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 (b)failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.” 13. In fixing the amount of the penalty the ICO took account the mitigating effect of the potential for damage to FEP’s reputation, and the aggravating feature that the ICO had previously given FEP guidance on compliance, that FEP might gain an unfair advantage over its competitors through unlawful marketing activity and that there was also a breach of regulation 24 of PECR in that the it had not identified the person instigating the calls and provide a free address of telephone number for that person. 14. In its appeal FEP disputed the notice and penalty:- <U+F0B7> The number of calls made in breach of Regulation 19 and, having discounted “failed calls” asserted that its records showed 561,951 calls were made. It further claimed that there was no breach of Regulation 21 – relying on the indemnity provided to FEP by its data provider DWD. <U+F0B7> The level of fine, arguing the starting point should have been Band C - £40,001 to £100,000 which would then be reduced on account of undue hardship. <U+F0B7> The ICO had failed to take into account the financial hardship, the short period of breach, the breach had been by one employee not sanctioned by the board, FEP was a family company of modest means and had co-operated with the ICO since the end of automated calling, FEP had not made gains through its actions. <U+F0B7> The ICO had taken into account irrelevant considerations, breach of Regulations 19 and 24, both of which were disputed. <U+F0B7> The ICO had committed an error of law by finding deliberate wrongdoing <U+F0B7> The penalty was out of line with penalties for similar breaches. 15. The ICO maintained his position in resisting the appeal. In the light of a reconsideration of the category of failed calls the ICO considered that a sanction of £160,000 was the correct level. 16. The written evidence of a partner in the firm of accountants instructed by FEP to prepare its annual accounts was that the company was cash insolvent and could not absorb any monetary penalty. An exceptional item in the accounts of £467,515 for 8Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 the alleged stolen boilers reflected a figure given to the accountants by FEP and no specific work had been done to check its accuracy, however he viewed it as consistent with his understanding of the business. It would take the company almost two years to pay of the debts arising as a result of the theft. 17. Mr Alan Bonnyman and his wife own the majority of the shares in the company, the others are owned by their children. He told the tribunal that a major fraud had occurred in the company with a manager over-ordering boilers and then diverting them to his own benefit. This had been for a period of about nine months. There was no indication that the police were not proceeding with a case, however he had not been notified of any arrest. This had left the company with a debt to its main supplier of over £300,000. The commercial relationship between FEP the company and its supplier was continuing and they had agreed to repay at £18,000 a month over two years. This amount had recently been reduced to £10,000 a month. They had been given time to pay corporation tax and VAT; the total current liabilities were £402,331. In 2015 the company had acquired new premises and its old premises could be disposed of. He accepted that his son signed himself as a director and that he had been easing out of day to day control of the company for two years. He was not aware if his son had shown him correspondence from the ICO, his son had a high level of autonomy on decision- making with respect to sales and technology. He accepted that the company may have made a gain from telemarketing since the turnover had increased by £400,000 in that period, however they had made heavy losses. He hoped the sale of the surplus premises would be enough to wipe out losses. 18. He considered that the press release put out by the Respondent had harmed the reputation of the company causing a higher than usual proportion of cancellations. The company had in his view been trading honestly for 50 years and had not realised it was doing anything wrong. 19. Mr Craig Bonnyman agreed that he acted as a director of the company although he was not registered as such. In written evidence he stated that the company had a typical turnover of £1 to £1.5 million however in the last year turnover was £3.2 million with a loss of £100,000. 20. He accepted that the company had breached Regulation 21; the Regulations required a telephone caller to confirm who was calling and the company’s staff had not but had 9Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 used a generic name, however this was not, he claimed, to conceal the company’s identity and the phone line was registered to the company. He denied that the company had done this to disadvantage consumers “we didn’t purposely intend to remove a right from consumers, it was not our intention”. He acknowledged that at the time he replied to the ICO’s letter of 25 February 2015 he had not read the guidance provided. He explained that “I was listening to what I was told by the data supplier, I didn’t think he was lying”. He acknowledged that a practical way to give effect to the assurance to the ICO he gave at the start of the ICO’s investigation that “I plan on continuing to improve our standards to the satisfaction of regulators such as yourselves” would have been to read the guidance from the ICO. He did not recall the contents of the telephone conversation with the ICO’s office of 29 April (the ICO’s note of which stated that FEP “were no longer conducting Direct Marketing from Friday onwards as it hadn’t worked out for them due to the likes of us (the ICO) giving them hassle”). He did not recall any complaints before the ICO drew them to his attention. He accepted that he had not looked at the PECR before embarking on a programme of automated marketing. He had monthly reports from the manager of the team so information was not available to him that people were not happy with the phone calls. He claimed there was no benefit to the company from telemarketing. He accepted that the failure to train staff was an error of judgement. He knew that automated calling was a different kind of marketing, he did not know it was against the Regulations. He had relied on DWD for the data and another company to provide the operating software. 21. Mr Clancy, the enforcement manager for the ICO gave evidence with respect to the investigation. FEP had been placed on monitoring due concern about regulation 19, the subsequent investigation demonstrated breaches of regulations 19, 21 and 24. The creation of a separate company Centura was clearly for avoidance purposes however the issue of that avoidance had not been addressed in the monetary penalty notice. The level of penalty had been calculated on the basis of the information available. The conclusion that the appropriate level of sanction was level D was based on all the factors including the volume of calls and that such calls can only be made to consenting subscribers. 22. In his submissions for FEP Mr Massaro accepted that there had been a serious breach of the Regulations however he argued that it had been a negligent and not a deliberate 10Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 breach. A sanction of £160,000 was very large for a company with a turnover of £3.5 million. He repeated the arguments underlying the grounds of appeal. Consideration 23. The tribunal reminded itself that it conducted a full merits review of the case in the light of all the information available to it; not simply the available relied upon by the ICO. 24. There was a factual dispute between FEP and the ICO as to the number of calls relevant to the sanction. The ICO had agreed that the making of a failed call did not amount to the transmission of communication within the Regulation. However the function of the PECR was to protect personal privacy and they were engaged when a phone was connected. The service provider had confirmed that 934,176 calls were connected, at that stage the user’s phone had responded. FEP claimed that the correct figure was 561,951. Even on FEP’s own figure the number called was exceptionally large, a very large proportion of the phones in Scotland were illegitimately called, within a very short period. That was a very serious breach of PECR. Despite the non-identification of the source there were 94 recorded complaints to the ICO and some calls occasioned real distress. It was therefore proper to consider this as a case falling within Band D. 25. Contrary to the submission that Regulation 19 and 24 were irrelevant and not accepted by FEP it is clear that they form a significant background to the need for regulatory action and are relevant to the issue of the level of sanction furthermore the breaches have been accepted by FEP. The failure to have an identified originator of the call was a clear breach of Regulation 24(2). While Mr Craig Bonnyman considered this insignificant his attitude showed a clear failure to understand what the Regulations required. Since the calls were only permitted if there was consent, how could an individual called know whether the call was permitted if he did not know who was making the call? This was a separate and significant illegality and an aggravating factor in considering the Regulation 21 breach. The indemnity, such as it is, from the supplier of data does not prevent liability from attaching to FEP for its breach of Regulation 19, the more so since it is clear that even after the breach was identified FEP did not take effective steps to prevent the re-use of the data which it then knew to contained individuals who had not consented. 11Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 26. It was clear to the Tribunal that FEP was for several years a poorly controlled and badly managed company. It had embarked on a substantial growth programme expanding from a turnover of about £1 million to a turnover in excess of £3 million in a very short period. It had moved premises and had a substantial capital asset which was unused. During that period the managing director, Mr Alan Bonnyman had (in the rather apposite phrase of Counsel for the ICO) “been asleep at the wheel”. Control of some of the operations of the company had been effectively in the hands of a manager who over a period of nine months apparently made off with goods worth several hundreds of thousands of pounds. 27. In the meantime Mr Craig Bonnyman a shareholder in the family firm and the son of the director and acting as a de facto director, had unfettered control of marketing and sales activity. With a reckless abandon and frequently acting hastily and without thought he embarked on telemarketing with no knowledge of the legal framework. When the inevitable complaints reached the ICO he dissembled. He misled the ICO about ceasing telemarketing and on his instructions FEP’s solicitors wrote to the ICO a letter which was significantly misleading with respect to the recent actions and future intentions of FEP. The letter of 31 July 2015 states:- “(1) Cessation of telemarketing activity FEP has confirmed to us that it ceased from engaging in telemarketing activity from 7 May 2015” 28. While FEP in the hearing suggested that this was due to a misunderstanding and the solicitors had made an error; the Tribunal is satisfied that a reputable firm of solicitors such as Harper MacLeod could not have made such a fundamental error on a crucial issue in dealings with a Regulator on behalf of a client. It wrote the letter on the instructions of FEP, the letter was false, and in now claiming the solicitors were in error FEP confirmed its own shortcomings in the hearing in the starkest possible way. 29. Mr Craig Bonnyman set up Centura Direct Marketing partly (he claimed) to secure a larger income for himself however its foundation and operations were clearly part of the strategy of concealing FEP’s continued use of telemarketing. The tribunal found Mr Craig Bonnyman an unsatisfactory witness. In the light of these matters it is clear that the actions of the company were deliberate calculated risks – there was deliberate 12Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 wrongdoing by the company organised by the family member in day to day control of most of its operations. 30. While FEP made much play of the issue of financial hardship and the risks of the company becoming insolvent if the penalty were imposed the Tribunal was unconvinced by the evidence. It accepted the evidence of Mr McKelvie that FEP had significant difficulties with cashflow. The company has entered into arrangements with HMRC and a trade supplier to phase payment of its liabilities over time. However the company has grown substantially over the last years and there is little to indicate (from the inconsistent and unreliable financial and operational information put forward), that apart from the exceptional item of the alleged dishonesty by a staff member, the company is not able to continue to trade profitably going forward. FEP’s witnesses were inconsistent in whether or not the company had profited by its breach of PECR and the information is simply unreliable on the point. It is clear however that the company intended to, and deliberately breached the rights of hundreds of thousands of people in order to make a profit; given the scale of this clandestine operation it is clear that some additional business must have come to FEP due to this marketing activity. Although it is submitted that FEP has co-operated with the ICO since the end of automated calling, the deception prior to that, the minimisation of the wrong done and attempt to blame the previous solicitors are not consistent with a true acceptance of the misconduct. 31. The Tribunal is satisfied that the level of sanction originally imposed by the ICO was proportionate in all the circumstances and does not accept the submission that it was out of line with those imposed in cases which were properly comparable. The Tribunal noted the concession made by the ICO in the light of the changed position with respect to unsuccessful calls. The facts as established by the Tribunal would have justified a higher penalty, however in the light of the concession the Tribunal substitutes a penalty of £160,000. The original penalty notice offered a discount for prompt payment, this is no longer relevant. While the ICO may choose to come to some arrangement for the payment of the penalty by monthly payments over a 1-2 year period as HMRC and the trade creditor have done the Tribunal is satisfied that such a matter should not, in this case, be a matter for decision by the Tribunal. 32. Our decision is unanimous. 13Appeal No: EA/2016/0093 Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 3 December 2016 14"

The Appellant in these proceedings is critical of the journalistic standards of the BBC in relation to a BBC One Panorama programme broadcast in 2013 “Saving Syria’s Children” (“SSC”). | | |2. He pursued a complaint through the BBC processes and was dissatisfied with , the outcome; he told the tribunal that the BBC disagreed “without addressing many of my points”. 3. On 14 January 2016 he made a sixteen part request for information concerning the broadcast including for:- | “1. All internal BBC communications, documents and reports relating to the | commissioning, planning and production of SSC... 3, All internal BBC communications, documents and reports pertaining to complaints | made by myself and others about SSC and related BBC News reports..... | 5. All footage and still images shot by members of the SSC team..... 10 Recordings or transcripts of interviews with members of the SSC team conducted by the BBC Trust Unit's Independent Editorial Adviser (IEA) 12. All other recordings or transcripts, correspondence, documents and reports | pertaining to investigations and deliberations of Stages 1,2 and 3 of the BBC complaints process in respect of complaints made by myself and others about SSC and related BBC News reports...” | 4. The BBC replied promptly on 26 January 2016 explaining that it would not release the information:- “The information you have requested is excluded from the Act because it is held for the purposes of “journalism, art or literature”. The BBC is therefore not obliged to provide this information to you and will not be doing so on this occasion. Part VI of Schedule 1 to FOIA provides that information held by the BBC and the other public service broadcasters is only covered by the Act if it is held for “purposes other than those of Journalism, art or literature”. The BBC is not required to supply information held for the purposes of creating the BBC’s output or information that supports and is closely associated with these creative activities.” | 5. The Appellant complained to the Respondent Information Commissioner (“ICO”) on 11 February 2016 about the refusal. In that complaint he indicated that he had complained to the Metropolitan Police and he complained that the BBC had contravened Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”) which prohibits propaganda for war and advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred. 6. The ICO wrote explaining the preliminary conclusion of the investigation on | 12 March. This explained that the BBC is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature. The letter quoted from the Supreme Court decision in Sugar (Deceased) v British Broadcasting Corporation and another — [2012] UKSC4 which explained this expression (Lord Walker at para 70):- : “journalism, art or literature’ seems to be intended to cover the whole of the BBCs | output in its mission (under article 5 of its Royal Charter) to inform, educate and | entertain the public. On that comprehensive approach the purposes of journalism, art | | | |or literature would be, quite simply, the purposes of the BBC’s entire output to the public.” | 7. The Appellant repeated his claim with respect to the ICCPR and asked that the ICO proceed to a decision notice. : 8. In his decision notice the ICO re-affirmed the position he had previously indicated and the stance the BBC had taken concluding (DN para 16, 18):- “16 The Commissioner considers that the requested information is directly related to | . the BBC’s output as it relates to planning and production of a programme that was aired on the BBC in September 2013. In particular it relates to the gathering and collecting of material for broadcast and any reviews of the standards and quality of the production on the back of any complaints received. | 18 The Commissioner has therefore found that the request is for information held for the purposes of journalism and that the BBC was not obliged to comply with Parts I to V of the Act”. 9. The appeal was lodged on 26 April. It set out why the Appellant considered the broadcast was fabricated and claimed that the release would facilitate “myself and others” in pursuing “rights owed under Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” 10. The Registrar in a Case Management Note of 3 May explained the Tribunal’s power and jurisdiction which was limited to deciding whether the decision notice was in accordance with the law and the tribunal was unable to grant him a remedy with respect to his claim of breach of the ICCPR. She further explained that he had not provided grounds for appeal which explained why , he considered the ICO was “wrong in law i.e. the ICO was wrong to conclude that the information was held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature.” She directed that he provide “any reasons that he says the information he sought was/is not held by the BBC for purposes of journalism, art or literature”. Despite this clear instruction the Appellant failed to comply with this requirement. He placed the Case Management Note on the internet without permission and was directed by the Tribunal to remove it. | 11. In the reply the ICO provided a history of the Appellant’s complaints to the BBC alleging breach of BBC and OFCOM guidelines and the steps the BBC had taken to investigate, leading to the conclusion of an Independent Editorial Adviser:- “... The EIA’s conclusion, taking into account this evidence, was that the incident depicted in Panorama took place as described... | | The Adviser reviewed the authoritative body of evidence substantiating the Panorama | programme and concluded that were this complaint to proceed to appeal, Trusteeswould not be likely to uphold the allegation. She therefore did not consider the appeal had a reasonable prospect of success and did not propose to put it before Trustees”. 12. The ICO resisted the appeal and set out a detailed exposition of the law in the | light of the binding decision of the Supreme Court in Sugar. 13. In the Tribunal the Appellant agreed that he was concerned with journalistic _ standards. It was clear that he had not turned his mind to the contents of the Case Management Note directing him to explain why he said that the information was not held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, nor had he engaged with the explanations put forward successively by the BBC | and the ICO. He was unable to assist the Tribunal with any arguments why the material was not held for the purposes of journalism, merely his strongly | held belief that the material was not genuine. He was unable to grasp or explain the fundamental flaw at the heart of his appeal, that having complained about standards of journalism of the BBC (indeed articulating that concern at the start of the hearing) and pursued the BBC complaints process with respect to these standards, he now argued that a news and current affairs programme was not journalism. 14. The difficulty the Tribunal faces with that argument is that it is does not have the jurisdiction to review the standards of journalism of the BBC or consider how the BBC has handled his complaint about standards, those responsibilities lie primarily with the BBC Trust, certainly not with this Tribunal. The decision in Sugar (see paragraph 6 above) is quite clear, the exemption covers the whole of the BBC’s output, whether it is broadcast to “inform, educate and entertain” (BBC Charter) and whether it is categorised as journalism, art or literature” _ (FOIA), the Tribunal is not in a position to order its disclosure. 15. At no stage has the Appellant advanced any argument to show why the ICO was wrong in law. The law is very clear. The BBC’s status under FOIA recognises the importance of the freedom to communicate and express and receive ideas and information which is enshrined in Article 10 of the European | Convention on Human Rights and FOIA excludes such material from its regime in order to protect journalism and art from state control. The broadcast and associated material are held for the purposes of journalism. This appeal is without foundation and is dismissed. 16. Our decision is unanimous.

"108","EIR","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL EA/2016/0138 (GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER) [INFORMATION RIGHTS] ON APPEAL FROM: Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice: FS50616675 Dated: 9 May 2016 Appellant: SIMON PRICE Respondent: THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Date of hearing: 13 September 2016 Date of Decision: 19 September 2016 Date Promulgated: 21 September 2016 Before Annabel Pilling (Judge) Subject matter: FOIA – Whether information is held – s.1 Representation: For the Appellant: Simon Price For the Respondent: Louisa Smith, Elizabeth KelseyDecision For the reasons given below, the Tribunal allows the appeal. This Decision is to be treated as a substituted Decision Notice. Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This is an appeal against a Decision Notice issued by the Information Commissioner (the ‘Commissioner’) dated 9 May 2016. 2. The Decision Notice relates to a request made on 20 July 2015 by the Appellant under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ‘FOIA’) to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) for information in respect of the provision of kosher food for strictly observant Orthodox Jewish prisoners: “In June 2015 the Kitchen Manager at HMP Wakefield claims that he was advised…that any prisoner who the Ministry of Justice has agreed is a strictly observant Orthodox Jew and …must be treated as such, must nonetheless arrange for his shul to provide the appropriate kosher food as set out in paragraph 3.24 of the Catering Operation Manual? In light of the above please provide me with all available data relating to the following matters: 1. The full details of the instructions and procedure whereby any prisoner who the Ministry of Justice has agreed must be treated as a strictly observant Orthodox Jew must nonetheless arrange for his shul to provide the appropriate kosher food as set out in paragraph 3.24 of the Catering Operation Manual? 2. On what authority or in what Prison Service Instruction has any such instruction/provision been made for any prisoner to have food brought in from outside the prison?3. The relevant instructions given to Security departments in the High Security estate in order that they may comply with the practice described in (1) above 4. What provision is currently made in compliance with paragraph 3.24 of the Catering Operation Manual for strictly Orthodox Jewish prisoners to receive appropriate kosher food from the prison? 5. What arrangements are in place for a Foreign National prisoner who is a strictly Orthodox Jew to be provided with appropriate kosher food?” 3. The MOJ responded on 5 October 2015, confirming that the department holds some but not all of the information requested “as there is no requirement for this information to be centrally held” and provided information which was held relevant to the request. This pointed the Appellant to the standards of provision which establishments must meet set out in a Prison Service Instruction (2010/44) which is normally available within the prison library, and then reproducing the relevant parts of the guidance issued to prisons regarding religious diets specifically those who require a Kosher meal, that is paragraphs 3.22-3.25 of the Catering Operation Manual. 4. The Appellant requested an internal review, complaining that the response was “little more than a cut and paste extract from the Catering Operation Manual, a copy of which, as my request would clearly have indicated, I already possess.” 5. The MOJ responded on 6 January 2016, indicating that having spoken to the Head of Catering at Wakefield prison, there is no other written communication or guidance about the matter at Wakefield. 6. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner who investigated the way the request had been dealt with by the MOJ. He concluded that on the balance of probabilities the MOJ has provided all the recorded information it holds relevant to the request, where that information is not covered by section 21 as reasonably accessible to the Appellant from documents usually available in the prison library, namely thePrison Service Instruction 44/2010 (the ‘PSI’) and the Catering Operation Manual (the ‘COM’). He also found that the MOJ had breached section 17(1) of FOIA as it failed to provide its refusal to respond within 20 working days. The appeal to the Tribunal 7. The Appellant appeals against the Commissioner’s decision, maintaining that there must be further information falling within the scope of his request beyond the PSI and COM, copies of which he has had for some time in any event. 8. This is an appeal that can be heard by a Judge sitting alone under Practice Statement 11. 9. The Tribunal was provided in advance of the hearing with an agreed bundle of material, and written submissions from the parties, including submissions dated 8 September 2016 from the Commissioner. The Appellant appeared by video link. The Commissioner chose not to attend the hearing. The MOJ was not joined as a party and took no part in the appeal. The issues for the Tribunal 10. Under section 1(1) of FOIA, any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled, subject to other provisions of the Act, (a) to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds the information requested, and (b) if so, to have that information communicated to him. 11. Where an applicant complains to the Commissioner, or the Tribunal, that a public authority, here the MOJ, has wrongly determined that it does not hold any further information falling within the scope of a request for information under FOIA this raises an issue of fact for the Commissioner, or the Tribunal. The Tribunal will review the evidence and make a finding of fact on the balance of probabilities. 12. After lodging his appeal, the Appellant was provided with information pursuant to another request for information which, arguably, was for information also falling within the scope of this request. In March 2016the Appellant was provided with a copy of the advice and guidance provided by the individual named in the preamble to this request concerning the provision of kosher food to Orthodox Jewish Prisoners at Wakefield prison. It would appear from the dates of the emails in question that these post-date the request, although the Commissioner had not been provided with this information during his investigation. The MOJ maintains, by email to the Commissioner dated 12 August 2016, that the only information it holds relevant to the request is the PSI and the COM. 13. Although the MOJ maintains that its practices and procedures for the provision of kosher food to prisoners are contained exclusively in the PSI and the COM, the PSI and COM are national documents setting out general provision policy across the prison estate. I accept the unchallenged evidence of the Appellant that arrangements above and beyond those set out in the PSI and COM are in existence at HMP Wakefield in respect of another prisoner, also a strictly observant Orthodox Jew and also a Foreign National. 14. For those arrangements to exist, it would be inconceivable that authority would not be needed from a senior source, whether from a Prison Governor or elsewhere. It would be inconceivable that a decision for a prisoner to be provided with a dedicated refrigerator inside a high security prison would not have been approved without written authority. Those arrangements would likely have been the subject of advice from Jewish faith advisors and in my view it is inconceivable that this would not have been recorded. 15. Once in place, the refrigerator is used on a regular basis by the prisoner and kosher foodstuffs, beyond those provided to other strictly observant Orthodox Jewish prisoners, are brought into the prison. If these foodstuffs are not provided by the prison directly, which appears to be the case on the basis of the material before me, it follows that there must be arrangements for its delivery. If the items are provided by the prison directly, again in my view there must be some recorded decision to do so and setting out the appropriate arrangements. 16. As HMP Wakefield is a high security establishment, items from anunidentified person could not simply be left at a main gate and taken to the prisoner directly without more. At a minimum, there must exist written guidance in respect of, for example, how often items can be delivered, who by, when delivery could take place, what those items could be, how they are to be delivered, how they are to be packaged and setting out the arrangements for inspecting those items before transporting to the prisoner or the prisoner’s refrigerator. 17. At no stage does there appear to have been any enquiry made of the Prison Governor or Head of Security. I do not have any information in respect of the role or remit of the Head of Catering. I am not satisfied that the MOJ has made a reasonable search for information falling within the scope of this request. 18. On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that the MOJ must hold further information falling within the scope of the request. The Commissioner was wrong to conclude that the only information held was the PSI and the COM. It follows that the Commissioner was incorrect to conclude that the MOJ was entitled to rely on section 21 of FOIA in relation to parts 1,2, 3 and 5 of the request. The PSI and the COM may well be reasonably accessible to the Appellant and he accepts that he has his own copies in any event, but further information falling within the scope of these parts of the request must be held. 19. I cannot order any specific disclosure as the MOJ will have to consider what further information is held, whether the cost of complying would exceed the appropriate limit or whether any part 2 exemption might be applicable.

REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Mr Norman Hudson (the Appellant) wrote to the Welsh Government on 18 November 2014 asking for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 2000. 2. The information he was seeking related to a previous FOIA request he had made (Decision Notice FS50538947). The request in this appeal relates to that information and specifically …. with reference to Paragraph 11 of the Decision Notice, please let me have a copy of the Legal Advice your department now admits to having obtained after my Meeting on 13 November 2013. 3. On 17 November 2014 the Welsh Government responded, confirming that it held the information but refusing to disclose it on the basis of the FOIA exemption in section 42 (1) relating to Legal Professional Privilege. It confirmed this decision to him after an internal review in January 2015. -2-The complaint to the Information Commissioner 4. In a Decision Notice dated 15 October 2015 the Commissioner held – for reasons set out at Paragraphs 7 – 29 – that the Welsh Government had complied with its obligations under FOIA and could rely on the section 42 (1) exemption. The appeal to the Tribunal 5. In his appeal to the Tribunal dated 3 November 2015 he complained about the conduct of the Welsh Government and of the Information Commissioner in relation to his request. 6. He relied generally on the “Nolan Principles” applying to individuals occupying public office (including members of the civil service) and the “Rules of Natural Justice”. 7. Specifically, he identified the following elements, summarised below: (1) The decision had the appearance of bias and was unjust. (2) The Welsh Government had been dishonest in its dealings with the Commissioner specifically because of one Welsh Government employee’s breach of the Nolan “honesty” Principle. (3) The legal advice had not maintained its confidential status. (4) The Appellant had not been provided with an opportunity to scrutinise the Welsh Government’s evidence. (5) The information had been obtained for purposes other than the provision of legal advice and should not have been protected by LPP. 8. The Appellant set out a series of outcomes he was seeking from this appeal. These were: (1) An order that the Welsh for Adults Centres refund fees to all those taught by tutors not specifically qualified to teach Welsh. -3-(2) That Awen Penri be held account for her “flagrant breach” of the Nolan “Honesty” Principle. (3) That the Commissioner reviewed his decision notice taking into account the number of individuals taught by non-qualified teachers and the amount of fees paid by those individuals once he had ascertained such figures. 9. It should be noted here that fulfilling the outcomes in Paragraph 8 above are not within the statutory remit of the Information Rights Tribunal. The questions for the Tribunal 10. Has the exemption in section 42 (1) of FOIA been correctly applied to the information requested on the basis that it engaged and fulfilled the requirements to protect Legal Professional Privilege? Evidence 11. The Tribunal has considered the open and withheld information itself and adopted the guidance for the approach to be taken by courts and tribunals in respect of any closed material procedure set out immediately below. 12. In Bank Mellat v HMT (no.1) [2013] UKSC 38, which was not a case about FOIA, Lord Neuberger said at paragraphs 68-74 that: i) If closed material is necessary, the parties should try to minimise the extent of any closed hearing. ii) If there is a closed hearing, the lawyers representing the party relying on the closed material should give the excluded party as much information as possible about the closed documents relied on. iii) Where open and closed judgments are given, it is highly desirable that in the open judgment the judge/Tribunal (i) identifies every conclusion in the open judgment reached in whole or in part in the light of points made or evidence referred to in the closed judgment and (ii) says that this is what they have done. -4-iv) A judge/Tribunal who has relied on closed material in a closed judgment should say in the open judgment as much as can properly be said about the closed material relied on. Any party excluded from the closed hearing should know as much as possible about the court’s reasoning, and the evidence and the arguments it has received. 13. In Browning v Information Commissioner and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [2013] UKUT 0236 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal issued similar guidance about the use of closed material and hearings in FOIA cases, noting that such practices are likely to be unavoidable in resolving disputes in this context: i) FOIA appeals are unlike criminal or other civil proceedings. The Tribunal’s function is investigative, i.e. it is not concerned with the resolution of an adversarial civil case based on competing interests. ii) Closed procedures may therefore be necessary, for consideration not only of the disputed material itself, but also of supporting evidence which itself attracts similar sensitivities. iii) Parliament did not intend disproportionate satellite litigation to arise from the use of closed procedures in FOIA cases. iv) Tribunals should take into account the Practice Note on Closed Material in Information Rights Cases (issued in May 2012). They should follow it or explain why they have decided not to do so. v) Throughout the proceedings, the Tribunal must keep under review whether information about closed material should be provided to an excluded party. 14. The closed bundle in this appeal contained the information on which the exemption at section 42 (1) was claimed. It was necessary for the Tribunal to see this and consider it, when set against the Open material, before reaching its conclusions. 15. The Tribunal has considered carefully and rigorously the material in the light of the Appellant’s points and concerns already expressed in the notice of appeal. It has been able to scrutinise it to assess whether the exemption has been fairly and lawfully claimed. -5-16. The Tribunal has not felt it necessary to use a Closed Annex for its reasoning in this appeal because the reasons themselves are on the face of its Open decision. 17. To satisfy itself that the Welsh Government had approached the application of the exemption correctly the Tribunal on 23 May 2016, after initially considering the all the material in this appeal, directed the Welsh Government: (1) Provide to the Tribunal a copy of the relevant policy that was in force at the time of the request. (2) Provide a copy of the link to the Welsh Government Code of Practice. (3) Indicate whether the Appellant has ever been told that, in the view of the Welsh Government having taken legal advice, he was mistaken about the correct interpretation of the term “relevant course"" in the Regulations. 18. On 27 May 2016 the Welsh Government complied with that Direction in respect of all three points. In respect of the third one, it replied: Following receipt of legal advice, the WG can confirm that the Appellant was not told that he was mistaken about the interpretation of the term “relevant course” in the 2002 Regulations. However, policy officials only sought advice from the WG’s Legal Services Department in order to satisfy themselves that they were interpreting the 2002 Regulations correctly. The content of the legal advice did not contradict any of the views expressed by officials at the meeting on 13 November 2013. 19. If, having read the advice, the Tribunal had found evidence that the Welsh Government was misleading the public on the legal position this would have altered the public interest test balance but this was not the case. -6-Conclusion and remedy 20. The Tribunal reminded itself that the exemption within section 42 is not an absolute one but is qualified. The exemption can be overridden if, on balance, the public interest in its disclosure outweighs the public interest in the maintenance of the exemption. 21. Legal Professional Privilege has two aspects: firstly there is legal advice privilege and secondly there is litigation privilege. 22. The advice at the heart of this appeal relates to legal advice privilege. That is concerned with confidential communications between a lawyer (who can include an in-house lawyer) and the client (in this case the Welsh Government) for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice in both litigation and non-litigation scenarios. 23. The privilege in this appeal belongs to the Welsh Government. 24. The case law of the Information Rights Tribunal makes it clear that confidentiality in the information in question is not lost simply because there has been limited disclosure to individual parties or limited public references to privileged material for instance by way of a brief summary in a public report or on a website. 25. The public interest in being able to receive “disinterested and frank legal advice” in order to assist public authorities like the Welsh Government in making appropriate decisions exists – particularly in this case – to allow those giving it to do so “unfettered by concerns about disclosure”. 26. That formulation comes from the leading Tribunal case of Bellamy v IC and DTT from April 2006 and it is been followed in a long line of cases. The High Court subsequently endorsed it as the correct approach in DBERR v O’Brien and IC [2009] EWHC 164 (QB) at [48]. -7-27. The Tribunal finds that the information in question was created by an in- house lawyer at the Welsh Government and was provided to policy officials employed by the Welsh Government. This is clearly within the boundaries of a client/lawyer relationship. 28. Looking at the withheld information it is clear to the Tribunal that it is legal advice. It was provided by the in-house lawyer for the policy officials in the Welsh Government who were responsible for the Welsh Government’s Welsh for Adults. 29. It concerns the interpretation of the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (Wales) Regulations 2002. The advice relates to Regulations that are still in force and which the Welsh Government must comply with. 30. The advice itself was obtained in relation to a complaint made by the Appellant himself and the Appellant continues actively to pursue that complaint. 31. The Welsh Government’s information to the Commissioner on 10 July 2015 was that: The advice has retained its confidential status. It has not been distributed within the Welsh Government on an unrestricted basis or shared with any third parties outside the organisation. 32. The Appellant has provided no evidence that undermines this position. 33. Having considered the information in question, the Tribunal agrees that the balancing exercise in terms of the public interest was conducted correctly. Namely: (1) There is a strong public interest in public authorities providing full and frank information to their legal advisers and receiving full and -8-frank advice without fear that the information or advice in question will be disclosed without their permission. This protects the present information and also ensures that public authorities can continue to seek full and frank legal advice in the future. (2) The disclosure of the legal advice in respect of the interpretation of the Regulation could prejudice the Welsh Government’s ability to defend its legal interests and unfairly expose it to challenge. (3) While there is a public interest in transparency and accountability, because this allows individuals to enhance their understanding of the reasons for decisions taken by any public body, there is no evidence provided by the Appellant that any of the potential countervailing reasons to dis-apply the exemption are present in this appeal. 34. In dismissing the Appellant’s appeal, the Tribunal notes that, practically, it would have made sense for the Welsh Government, following receipt of the legal advice, to tell the Appellant that he was mistaken about the interpretation of the term “relevant course” in the 2002 Regulations and explain why. 35. Our decision is unanimous. 36. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 4 July 2016 -9-"

EA/2015/0132 + 0153 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Subject matter: EIR 2004 Exceptions, Regs 12 (4) and (5) - Internal communications 4 (e) DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notices dated 19 May and 24 June 2015 and dismisses the appeals. REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Four Marks is a small village with its own Parish Council in Hampshire. 2. A piece of land in the parish known as “Storey’s Sanctuary” – after a former Parish Councillor who was instrumental in having that open space land made available to the public – had been unoccupied for many years. 3. An owner of property adjacent to part of the land had obtained Possessory Title to the land.1 Fencing had been erected on other parts by adjoining landowners. The requests for information 1 Possessory Title depends on adverse possession and can be upgraded to Absolute Title after being in possession as proprietor for 12 years: Land Registration Act 2002 (s.62 (1), (4)). -2-4. Dr Stephen Whitehead (the Appellant) made two separate information requests to Four Marks Parish Council which are the subject of these two appeals. 5. In the first, dated 24 October 2014, he asked: 1. Please provide a copy of the minutes of the closed session of the Parish Council held on 17 September 2014. This was requested in my email of 7 October. 2. Please state whether the Parish Council has in fact adopted a publication scheme in accordance with section 19 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. If so, please provide a copy as requested in my email of 13 October and state on what date it was adopted and on what date it was approved by the Information Commissioner. Please also state whether and if so in what manner it has been published in accordance with section 19 (4). 3. Please provide a full copy of the standing orders applying to meetings of the Parish Council. This was requested in my email of 13 October. 6. The Parish Council, in its response of 27 November 2014, refused to provide the information requested at point 1, provided narrative information in relation to point 2 and provided a copy of the information requested at point 3. 7. In subsequent correspondence the Parish Council relied, on 12 December 2014, on its conclusion that the request for the copy of the minutes came under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. It applied the exceptions at Regulations 12 (4) (e), 12 (5) (b) and 12 (5) (d). 8. In respect of this the Information Commissioner decided that Regulation 12 (4) (e) had been correctly applied on the basis that the exception allowed public authority to refuse to disclose information in relation to internal communications. 9. In the second, dated 10 December 2014, he asked the Parish Council: Please provide a copy of the minutes of the closed session of the Parish Council held on 26 November 2014. -3-10. The Parish Council eventually responded on 23 January 2015. It refused to provide the information citing the same EIR exceptions. 11. The Information Commissioner decided, on 24 June 2015, that Regulation 12 (4) (e) had been correctly applied for the same reason as the first information request. The appeals to the Tribunal 12. The Appellant’s arguments in relation to these appeals are set out in his separate Grounds of Appeal. 13. He has amalgamated and expanded on both of these in his 13-page, 96- paragraph reply to the Information Commissioner’s Responses to each appeal. In summary he states: 1. EIR exception Regulation 12 (4) (e) was not engaged because neither document were internal communications. 2. The Information Commissioner’s findings about the balance of the public interest did not support the decisions that the exception was correctly applied. 3. The Information Commissioner had failed to consider fully all the relevant factors favouring the public interest in disclosure. 4. The Information Commissioner had given excessive weight to the “safe space” and “chilling effect” arguments in favour of applying the exception. 5. The public interest in maintaining the exception was, in fact, outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. 14. He sets out (at Paragraphs 15 – 21) what he contended was the background history about the land to which the documents he was seeking refer. In summary: 1. The withheld documents contained minutes of discussions relating to the whole or part of what was at one time a single irregularly- shaped plot of land in the village of Four Marks. The plot had no specific name and the identity of the legal owner was unknown. It was bounded on all sides by residential plots except for a short part of the southern boundary with a passageway between two gardens at the eastern end leading to the road. It was formerly in use as pasture but had been unused for many years and had become -4-overgrown with trees and scrub. It had never been in use as public open space. 2. Part of the land at the western end had been enclosed many years ago by neighbouring residents who subsequently registered possessory title and obtained outline planning permission for housing development that had not, as yet, been carried out. Another area of land towards the centre of the original plot was enclosed by another resident in approximately 1998 with the stated intention of preventing any attempt at development. 3. The name “Storey’s Sanctuary” was not in general use but was understood to be used by the Parish Council to refer to the part of the original plot excluding the enclosed portion at the western end. 4. From 2005 until 2014 there had been sporadic annexations of portions of the land with the Parish Council then removing fences. 5. The minutes of the Parish Council and its committees showed that it had also considered the possibility of mounting some form of legal challenge to the 2011 registration of possessory title. 15. The Appellant also contended that the Parish Council was under a legal obligation to make the information available for inspection by virtue of section 228 (1) of the Local Government Act 1972. The questions for the Tribunal 16. In both appeals the Tribunal must decide whether the relevant exception is properly engaged and, if so, where the balance of the public interest falls in terms of maintaining or disclosing the information requested. 17. The withheld information in both appeals was disclosed to the Tribunal as closed, confidential material. Evidence 18. The Tribunal reminded itself of the guidance for the approach to be taken by courts and tribunals in respect of any closed material procedure. -5-19. In Bank Mellat v HMT (no.1) [2013] UKSC 38, which was not a case about FOIA, Lord Neuberger said at paragraphs 68-74 that: i) If closed material is necessary, the parties should try to minimise the extent of any closed hearing. ii) If there is a closed hearing, the lawyers representing the party relying on the closed material should give the excluded party as much information as possible about the closed documents relied on. iii) Where open and closed judgments are given, it is highly desirable that in the open judgment the judge/Tribunal (i) identifies every conclusion in the open judgment reached in whole or in part in the light of points made or evidence referred to in the closed judgment and (ii) says that this is what they have done. iv) A judge/Tribunal who has relied on closed material in a closed judgment should say in the open judgment as much as can properly be said about the closed material relied on. Any party excluded from the closed hearing should know as much as possible about the court’s reasoning, and the evidence and the arguments it has received. 20. In Browning v Information Commissioner and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [2013] UKUT 0236 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal issued similar guidance about the use of closed material and hearings in FOIA cases, noting that such practices are likely to be unavoidable in resolving disputes in this context: i) FOIA appeals are unlike criminal or other civil proceedings. The Tribunal’s function is investigative, i.e. it is not concerned with the resolution of an adversarial civil case based on competing interests. ii) Closed procedures may therefore be necessary, for consideration not only of the disputed material itself, but also of supporting evidence which itself attracts similar sensitivities. iii) Parliament did not intend disproportionate satellite litigation to arise from the use of closed procedures in FOIA cases. iv) Tribunals should take into account the Practice Note on Closed Material in Information Rights Cases (issued in May 2012). They should follow it or explain why they have decided not to do so. v) Throughout the proceedings, the Tribunal must keep under review whether information about closed material should be provided to an excluded party. 21. The closed bundles in this appeal contained the disputed information. -6-22. It was necessary for the Tribunal to see this withheld information – and to consider the totality of both – in relation to the exemptions claimed. 23. The Tribunal has considered carefully and rigorously the Appellant’s points and concerns already expressed in the notices of appeal and in his other representations and submissions. 24. As a result of its conclusions and reasons, the Tribunal’s decision is an open one and there is no closed, confidential annex. Conclusion and remedy 25. The reasons which follow are common to both information requests. 26. The Tribunal is satisfied that the correct EIR exemption, Regulation 12 (4) (e), is engaged in each situation. 27. The concept of a “communication” under that Regulation clearly includes any information someone “intends to communicate to others, or places on file so that others may read it”. 28. On that basis the minutes in respect of the first request clearly constitute a “communication”. 29. The minutes in question included details of communications between the public authority and an external solicitor. It was circulated within the public authority for its own use. 30. The Information Commissioner correctly observed that it was “the form of the communication that is important, rather than the content” [Paragraph 18 DN]. 31. The minutes of the closed session were correctly characterised as an “internal communication”. -7-32. The same reasoning obtains for the second request (in relation to Minute 14.162). 33. In terms of the public interest balancing test the Tribunal observes that neither of the Decision Notices reflect fully the importance these kind of contentious local issues can have on the members of the community affected by them. 34. In a sense, the smaller the community the greater interest will be – particularly on matters relating to common land and its ownership – in knowing exactly what is being discussed and how the outcome may affect the community. 35. By the same token that increases the countervailing factors that require considerable weight to be given to the public interest in maintaining the exemptions particularly when the issue at the heart of both information requests was still live. 36. The public authority in the circumstances had a greater need for a safe space to reach decisions away from external interference and without revealing its options or intentions to other parties in a situation where legal processes could be underway because it had yet to determine “what action to take, if any, in respect of the ongoing encroachment by neighbouring landowners”. 37. The Tribunal agrees that disclosure would have inhibited free and frank discussion and potentially could have led to poorer decision-making. The Timing of the two requests were of key importance in these appeals. The requests were both made within a short time of the meetings to which they related and when the issues were still very much live and under active consideration by the Council. Had they been made after the issues had been resolved the public interest in refusing the requests is likely to have been much weaker. -8-38. The Parish Council needed the safe space, in addition, to maintain the confidentiality of legal advice and to ensure that it was not discouraged from obtaining proper legal advice in appropriate cases. 39. Disclosure of the requested information could “detrimentally affect the decision-making process” and potentially “lead to less full and frank advice being provided to the council in future”. 40. The Tribunal concludes that the “safe space” considerations clearly outweigh the important public interest in allowing the requested information to become public. 41. In so far as the “chilling effect” arguments exist they are only minor considerations in the public interest balancing exercises considered in each appeal by the Tribunal. 42. With respect to the Appellant’s arguments about the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 and the legal requirement for minutes to be open for inspection under section 228 these are misplaced and erroneous. 43. Both Schedule 12 of the Local Government Act 1972 and Regulation 9 of the Openness of Local Government Bodies Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/2095) provide a legal framework governing the publication of minutes of local authorities and with extensive provision for information contained in such minutes to be withheld on the grounds of being confidential or exempt. 44. Particularly in the circumstances of these two appeals there is nothing to prevent closed minutes of the local authority being an “internal document” for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations. 45. For these reasons, both appeals must fail. -9-46. Our decisions are unanimous. 47. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 5 January 2016 - 10 -"

REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Issues relating to the use of intercept evidence and intercepted material within the justice system in the UK – particularly in criminal trials – is a matter of high importance. 2. “Intercept material” is the conventional term for information derived from the covert interception of private communications such as a telephone -2-call, an email, text message or a private message sent via a social media platform such as Facebook. 3. Since 1985, the use of intercept material as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings has been prohibited in the UK. 4. Historically the two pieces of statutory legislation that prohibit this are section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and, subsequently, under section 17 (1) (a) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). 5. Of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe, the UK is the only country with the statutory prohibition against the use of intercept as evidence. Intercept evidence is also regularly used in criminal proceedings in other common law jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. 6. The UK’s statutory ban on the use of intercept as evidence has been repeatedly criticised by senior police officers, prosecutors, judges, NGOs and parliamentarians. In 2000, Lord Lloyd Berwick – a former Law Lord and the first independent reviewer of terrorism legislation – told Parliament: We have here a valuable source of evidence to convicted criminals. It is especially valuable for convicting terrorist offenders because in cases involving terrorist crime it is very difficult to get any other evidence which can be adduced in court, for reasons with which we are all familiar. We know who the terrorists are, but we exclude the only evidence which has any chance of getting them convicted; we are the only country in the world to do so.1 7. In November 2001, the proposal to detain suspected foreign terrorists indefinitely without charge under what became Part 4 of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 was justified by one Home Office Minister in the following terms: If we could prosecute on the basis of the available evidence in open court, we would do so. There are circumstances in which we simply 1 Hansard, HL Debates 19 June 2000, col 109 – 110). -3-cannot do that because we do not use intercept evidence in our courts.2 8. Since 2001, the difficulty of prosecuting terrorism offences has also been cited by successive governments as justification for a number of other exceptional anti-terrorism measures, including extended pre-charged detention, control orders and terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs). 9. In 2007, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights referred to Steadily mounting evidence that the prohibition on the use of intercept as evidence is widely considered to be one of the principal obstacles to bringing more successful prosecutions of people suspected of involvement with terrorism.3 10. That Joint Committee concluded: We are satisfied that the evidence of the DPP and the former Attorney General puts the matter beyond doubt: that the ability to use intercept as evidence would be of enormous benefit in bringing prosecutions against terrorists in circumstances where prosecutions cannot currently be brought, and that the current prohibition is the single biggest obstacle to bringing more prosecutions terrorism. We recommend that this be taken as premise of forthcoming review by the Privy Council. The difficult question is not whether the current ban on the evidential use of intercept should be relaxed, but how to overcome the practical obstacles to such a relaxation.4 11. In the same month as the Joint Committee reported in 2007, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a Privy Council Review To advise on whether a regime to allow the use of intercepted material in court can be devised that facilitates bringing cases to trial while meeting the overriding imperative to safeguard national security. It will consider: The benefits that might reasonably be expected to result from such use (in terms, for example, of increases in the number of successful prosecutions in serious organised crime and terrorism cases); The risks, including from exposure of interception capabilities and techniques; The resource implications of any changes in the law; The implications of new communications technology; and 2 Lord Rooker, Hansard, HL Debates 27 November 2001, col 146.) 3 Counter-Terrorism Policy and Human Rights: 28 days, intercept and post-charge questioning, HL 157/HC 394, 16 July 2007 [107]. 4 Ibid [126]. -4-The experiences of other countries and their relevance to the UK.5 12. Following the report to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary by the Privy Council Review of Intercept as Evidence,6 the Government then commissioned a programme of work to implement the recommendations of the Privy Council Review. The report had recommended, among other things, that “intercept as evidence should be introduced”.7 It also set out certain operational tests that would have to be met in order to meet the concerns of the Intelligence Services, among others. 13. The programme of work to implement these recommendations focused on model known as “Public Interest Immunity Plus”. The implementation team was led by the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism in the Home Office and was carried out under the supervision of an Advisory Group of Privy Councillors. 14. That subsequent December 2009 report, Intercept as Evidence, set out the findings and conclusions of the programme of work.8 In his Foreword to that report the Home Secretary, Alan Johnson MP, stated: ….These confirm the potential gains from a workable scheme for intercept as evidence and that, while requiring significant additional funding, the model developed would be broadly consistent with the operational requirements identified. However, it is also the case that the model would not be legally viable, in terms of ensuring continued fairness at trial. The results would not only be potential miscarriages of justice and more expensive and complex trials but also more of the guilty walking free [emphasis added]. These findings are such that no responsible government could proceed with implementation on this basis. The Advisory Group concurs with this overall judgement. At the same time, both the Government and the Advisory Group believe that the potential gains from intercept as evidence justify further work, in order to establish whether the problems identified are capable of being resolved…. The issues involved are complex and difficult, and addressing them commensurately challenging. But the importance of our interception 5 25 July 2007. 6 Report, Cmd 7324, January 2008. The report’s authors were Sir John Chilcot, Lord Archer of Sandwell, Alan Beith MP and Lord Hurd of Westwell. 7 Ibid [204]. 8 Report, Cmd 7760, December 2009. -5-capabilities to national security and public protection means that there can be no short cuts.9 15. The report stated that “the sensitivities involved mean that the full weight of supporting evidence cannot be made public”.10 It had, however, been made available to Ministers and to the Advisory Group of Privy Councillors.11 This was said to include legal advice from independent Counsel.12 The request for information 16. It was against this background that the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law (the Appellant) requested from the Home Office, on 13 November 2012, the following information: Please would you supply us with the following information: a copy of the independent legal advice referred to in the report Intercept as Evidence (Cm 7760 December 2009). 17. On 11 January 2013 the Home Office told the Appellant that the requested information was exempt from disclosure. The Home Office relied on the FOIA exemptions in section 24 (1) in relation to national security, section 31 (1) in relation to law enforcement, section 35 (1) in relation to the formulation government policy and section 42 (1) in respect of legal professional privilege. It also relied on section 23 FOIA to neither confirm nor deny whether it held information supplied by all relating to bodies dealing with security matters. 18. An internal review was requested by the Appellant on 10 March 2013. The Home Office responded on 18 June 2013 upholding its original analysis but clarifying that it was claiming that the section 42 (1) exemption applied to all of the withheld information. 9 Ibid 4. 10 Ibid 6. 11 The Advisory Group comprised of Sir John Chilcot, Lord Archer of Sandwell, Sir Alan Beith MP and Michael Howard QC MP. 12 Ibid 9. -6-The complaint to the Information Commissioner 19. The Appellant complained to the Commissioner on 18 June 2013. That complaint resulted in the Decision Notice of 24 March 2014. 20. That Decision Notice focused on the application of section 42 (1) in relation to the withheld information and did not consider any of the other exemptions claimed by the Home Office. It concluded that section 42 (1) was engaged and that the Public Interest Balancing Test (PBIT) favoured maintaining the exemption. The Decision Notice observed in particular the comments in Bellamy13 that …. there is a strong element of public interest inbuilt into the privilege itself. At least equally strong countervailing considerations would need to be adduced to override that inbuilt public interest. The appeal to the Tribunal 21. The Appellant submitted its appeal to the Tribunal on 22 April 2014. 22. In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellant conceded that section 42 (1) was engaged. It disputed that the PIBT favoured maintaining the exemption. In essence the Appellant considered that the Commissioner’s analysis of the factors to be considered in evaluating PIBT was fundamentally flawed. 23. There was then and oral hearing with no live witnesses on 10 September 2014. The Home Office had not been joined as a party to those proceedings. 24. The decision that Tribunal reached on 19 September 2014 was appealed to the Upper Tribunal (AAC). The original Tribunal result was overturned 13 Bellamy v IC v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry EA/2005/0023. -7-by Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley.14 He ordered a full oral rehearing before a new Tribunal. 25. It is that rehearing that is the subject of this decision. Evidence 26. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from Ms Katy Hancock. She adopted her Open written witness statement dated 20 October 2015 and she was cross-examined on this by Counsel for the Appellant. 27. Her written witness statement had redactions and the Tribunal heard further evidence from her in closed session in relation the information that had been redacted as well and seeing the withheld information in its entirety. 28. In her Open evidence she explained that she had worked at the Home Office for six years and within interception policy for a period of over four months. 29. Before working on interception policy she had worked as a senior analyst at the Cabinet Office. 30. She was aware of only two other cases in relation to the government where a department had been ordered to disclose section 42 legal advice on public interest grounds and, in her view, neither of those cases bore any similarity to this matter. 31. She observed that the Home Office had not originally been joined to the appeal proceedings in September 2014 because it had been decided for cost reasons that it would rely on the submissions from the Commissioner. 14 Home Office v IC and Bingham Centre for Rule of Law [2015] UKUT 0308 (AAC). -8-32. She believed the Home Office thinking had been based on observations similar to those made in Cabinet Office v IC & Aitchison where it had been observed that it was difficult to imagine anything other than the rarest case where legal professional privilege should be waived in favour of public disclosure.15 33. She stated that the legal advice in question had been commissioned by the Home Office Legal Advisers and policy officials on the understanding that it would be treated as legally privileged material. 34. In the Intercept as Evidence December 2009 report a short excerpt of the conclusions of the advice had been included. The decision to release a summary of the advice in the report had been taken because the Home Office felt that it was sensible reasonable approach that allowed the public to have some insight into the process while maintaining the confidentiality of the substance and detail of the advice itself. 35. Providing a summary or gist of the advice allowed the public to understand the basis for the government’s position, while at the same time protecting the details that required protection. The public interest, she believed, had been met by the publication of the report which identified the varying legal models for the use of intercept material as evidence and comments on the conclusions presented by the independent legal advice. 36. She maintained that the Home Office had a legitimate expectation of confidentiality in the legal advice it had sought. The government and its officials had a mandate – as well as the responsibility – to formulate, develop and put forward for consideration appropriate policies that advanced the national interest. 37. The public expected decisions taken by government to be taken on the basis of good quality legal advice and that in itself was an aspect of the public interest. That was particularly compelling in the area of law enforcement and counter terrorism. The issues were complicated, fast- 15 Cabinet Office v IC & Aitchison [2013] UKUT 26 (AAC). -9-moving and often sensitive. Government departments needed high-quality comprehensive legal advice for the effective conduct of its day-to-day business. The advice needed to be given in a timely fashion to ensure the policy developed in a fully informed way. Legal advisors needed to be able to present the full picture to their clients including not only arguments in support of their conclusions but also the potential counter-arguments, in order to assess the merits of each. 38. Legal advice obtained by government departments often set out – within its reasoning – the perceived weaknesses of the department’s position, or counter-arguments that might be made. That material helped provide the government with comprehensive legal advice. Without such comprehensive advice, the quality of the government’s decision-making would be “much reduced because it would not be fully informed”. 39. Revealing the perceived weaknesses and counter-arguments would provide a clear path the disaffected parties to mount case. That would be contrary to the public interest and was an important consideration in the issues under review in the appeal. It could also create a situation of unfairness since other parties to litigation would not be forced to reveal what legal advice they had received. 40. Disclosure of legal advice would prejudice the government’s ability to defend its legal interests because it would mean unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge thus diminishing the reliance it could place on the advice being fully considered and presented without fear or favour. Neither of those outcomes was in the public interest. The former could result in serious consequential loss – or at least in a waste of resources in defending unnecessary challenges – and the latter could result in poorer decision-making. 41. There was also a risk that lawyers and clients would avoid making a permanent record of the advice given, or make any partial record. It was in the public interest that the provision of legal advice was fully recorded in - 10 -writing. As policy developed or litigation decisions were made it would be important to be able to refer back to advice given along the way. It was in the public interest that the record described the process of decision- making accurately and fully and the legal advice should be part of that record. A worst-case scenario would be a reluctance to seek advice at all and that could lead to decisions being made that would legally flawed. 42. In this case, if the legal advice in question was disclosed in its entirety it would provide – in essence – a road map for future challenges should the government in future decide to amend the framework. The advice set out in great detail the challenges of any changes to the system. Should those be made public it would inhibit the government from future revisions to the policy on the basis that potential weaknesses had already been spelt out in detail putting the government at a decisive disadvantage in the inevitable litigation that would follow. That would not be in the public interest and – in this case – it was imperative that the legal advice was protected in order to ensure future policy development on the topic was conducted thoroughly, and that officials did not feel that they had to shy away from being as open and transparent as they could be. She believed the approach taken in this particular case struck the correct balance by being as open and transparent as possible. 43. In relation to the Security Services exemption (section 23) she stated it was possible to argue that the entirety of the disputed information might be considered exempt under section 23 (1) – on the grounds that it broadly related to the work of bodies listed at section 23 (3) – but the Home Office was relying only on that exemption only insofar as it made explicit references to capabilities or challenges faced by section 23 bodies. 44. The public association between interception and the security intelligence agencies (SIA) had been the reason behind the Home Office decision to set aside its reliance on the “neither confirm nor deny” provision in section 23 (5). - 11 -45. She added that the issue of intercept evidence was “live” and was likely to remain so. The public interest in revealing the advice was limited in that it was already known that the advice set out the difficulties in reform. 46. She stated (in Paragraphs 28 – 30) of her open witness statement: The disputed information provides advice on how different options might function. It serves to provide officials with the basis on which to take forward policy formulation, enabling informed discussion and decision-making. As with any area of life policy, what is considered one point may be revised or set aside for use at a later point. In this respect the disputed information has enduring relevance to the policy formulation. Intercept as evidence is a sensitive issue, with a great deal of public speculation on whether or and how the government might wish to adapt the legal system to accommodate material obtained through interception. More so than many other areas of current government policy there is pressure from both groups and individuals to shape the debate around this issue and in a manner that supports their own particular narrative; the intention being to exert pressure on the policy process in order to promote a particular political or ideological considerations. In the face of pressure to introduce interceptors evidence in order to increase the number of successful prosecutions in serious crime and national security cases, eight reviews have been undertaken since 1993. The most recent review published its findings in 2014. The 2014 review went further than any previous review by considering the costs and benefits of an intercept as evidence regime, even if that meant considerable operational upheaval for the intercepting agencies. The review found that the substantial costs (between £4.25 billion and £9.25 billion over 20 years) outweighed the uncertain benefits. But the very fact that such a detailed review was published in 2014 (some two years after the date of the request) indicates that, at the time of the request in this case, the issue was very much a “live” one. I do not therefore think that it would be correct to characterise intercept evidence as “not live” in that way and in this context, as has been suggested. 47. Then, at the conclusion of Ms Hancock’s closed oral evidence, Mr Pievsky as Counsel for the Home Office, summarised what had been dealt with in the following way in open court: During the Closed Session Ms Hancock (a) referred to the information in dispute in order to clarify who commissioned and made use of the legal advice; - 12 -(b) confirmed her written Closed evidence as to the paragraphs in the legal advice to which section 23 applied; and (c) confirmed her written Closed evidence that the party political detriments of disclosure were not her main concern in relation to special detriment. She added that harm could be caused by disclosure if a few defendants in criminal trials knew the content of the legal advice. Conclusion and remedy 48. The structure of the Tribunal’s reasons and conclusions in respect of this appeal follow the three areas of the FOIA exemptions relied on by the Home Office (and which are set out in the Appellant’s skeleton argument). These are section 42 (Legal Professional Privilege), section 35 (formulation of government policy, etc) and section 23 (Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters). 49. Before dealing with that, however, the Tribunal reminded itself of the recent guidance for the approach to be taken by courts and tribunals in respect of any closed material procedure. 50. In Bank Mellat v HMT (no.1) [2013] UKSC 38, which was not a case about FOIA, Lord Neuberger said at paragraphs 68-74 that: i) If closed material is necessary, the parties should try to minimise the extent of any closed hearing. ii) If there is a closed hearing, the lawyers representing the party relying on the closed material should give the excluded party as much information as possible about the closed documents relied on. iii) Where open and closed judgments are given, it is highly desirable that in the open judgment the judge/Tribunal (i) identifies every conclusion in the open judgment reached in whole or in part in the light of points made or evidence referred to in the closed judgment and (ii) says that this is what they have done. iv) A judge/Tribunal who has relied on closed material in a closed judgment should say in the open judgment as much as can properly be said about the closed material relied on. Any party excluded from the closed hearing should know as much as possible about the court’s reasoning, and the evidence and the arguments it has received. - 13 -51. In Browning v Information Commissioner and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [2013] UKUT 0236 (AAC) the Upper Tribunal issued similar guidance about the use of closed material and hearings in FOIA cases, noting that such practices are likely to be unavoidable in resolving disputes in this context: i) FOIA appeals are unlike criminal or other civil proceedings. The Tribunal’s function is investigative, i.e. it is not concerned with the resolution of an adversarial civil case based on competing interests. ii) Closed procedures may therefore be necessary, for consideration not only of the disputed material itself, but also of supporting evidence which itself attracts similar sensitivities. iii) Parliament did not intend disproportionate satellite litigation to arise from the use of closed procedures in FOIA cases. iv) Tribunals should take into account the Practice Note on Closed Material in Information Rights Cases (issued in May 2012). They should follow it or explain why they have decided not to do so. v) Throughout the proceedings, the Tribunal must keep under review whether information about closed material should be provided to an excluded party. 52. The closed bundle in this appeal contained the disputed information and the unredacted witness statement from Ms Hancock. 53. It was necessary for the Tribunal to see the disputed information – and consider the totality of it – in relation to the exemptions claimed. 54. The Tribunal has considered carefully and rigorously the Appellant’s points and concerns already expressed in the notice of appeal and in its other representations and submissions. 55. As a result of its conclusions and reasons the Tribunal’s decision is an open one with no closed, confidential annex. 56. The Tribunal does not propose to elaborate further on the information in the unredacted witness statement or – as a result of its decision generally – to give any further detail of the withheld information save that which was - 14 -in the open material. It is not possible to do so in any realistic or proportionate sense without defeating the object of maintaining the elements of the legal professional privilege. Section 42: Legal Professional Privilege LPP did not belong to the Home Office. 57. The Appellant challenged whether the advice in question was obtained for the Home Office for its own use but accepted that the section 42 (1) exemption was engaged on the basis that the information requested was independent legal advice and therefore covered by legal advice privilege. 58. The Tribunal does not consider that this was the Appellant’s strongest point either as a matter of law or fact. Having heard the evidence from Ms Hancock and considered the detailed cross-examination of her on this point the Tribunal is satisfied that it was the Home Office who procured the legal advice in question for the benefit of the Privy Council Advisory group and that – in so far as matters need to be stretched – the benefit of the Legal Professional Privilege attaches equally to the Home Office, as commissioners of the advice by and for the Privy Council. 59. The Tribunal has had the benefit of seeing and considering the written and oral evidence provided by Ms Hancock – both as open and closed material – and has also observed her evidence tested under cross examination by experienced Counsel for the Appellant. 60. The evidence she provided throughout was clear, cogent and credible. For that reason, the Tribunal accepts and attaches significant weight to the veracity of her open witness statement at Paragraph 7: The legal advice in question was commissioned by Home Office Legal Advisers and policy officials on the understanding that, as with all legal advice the Home Office commissions, it would be treated as legally privileged material. - 15 -Interests ordinarily underpinning LLP absent because of the cross-party nature of the issue. 61. To the Tribunal, this seemed a strained argument by the Appellant. Why it should lose the protection of LPP simply because – having been commissioned by the Home Office – it was being used in a cross-party sense by this Privy Council Advisory group was not clear. 62. Looking at which interests were served by the relevant legally privileged advice it seems clear to the Tribunal that this was part of an exercise where the Government needed advice – via the Privy Council Advisory group as commissioned by the Home Office – on the law and that needed that to be confidential and professional. It is hard to imagine more compelling public interest considerations operating behind such legal advice. It is legal professional advice as cogent and relevant in respect of when it was prepared and presented as it has remained with the passage of time. Disclosure of the legal advice involves no realistic possibility of prejudice to the government’s interests. 63. As stated above, the Tribunal believes it would be hard to find a more concrete example in the totality of the advice provided of something that would almost certainly prejudice the government’s interests whether at the time of the original request, now or looking forward to the future. 64. The Appellant accepts that the core justification for protecting LPP is the common law right of access to the courts and maintaining respect for the rule of law. It is settled law that that principle is necessarily subject to limitation in those circumstances where protecting LPP would otherwise undermine fundamental rights or the rule of law. 65. While Parliament, in enacting section 42 FOIA, made it a qualified rather than an absolute exemption that necessarily demonstrated that Parliament did indeed contemplate a range of potential circumstances in which the - 16 -public interest in maintaining LPP would give way to the public interest in the disclosure of legal advice. The memorable comment in relation to this is that that “Section 42 is not to be elevated ‘by the back-door’ to an absolute exemption”.16 66. However, considering Ms Hancock’s open evidence – without even praying in aid matters seen and considered in full in the withheld information – the following public interest factors she identified properly create an overwhelming weight on the nondisclosure side of the balance. These are (précised from her witness statement): (1) In the Intercept as Evidence December 2009 report a short excerpt of the conclusions of the advice had been included. This allowed the public to have some insight into the process while maintaining the confidentiality of the substance and detail of the advice itself. (2) Providing a summary or gist of the advice allowed the public to understand the basis for the government’s position, while at the same time protecting the details that required protection. (3) Publication of the report identified the varying legal models for the use of intercept material as evidence and comments on the conclusions presented by the independent legal advice. (4) The government and its officials had a mandate – as well as the responsibility – to formulate, develop and put forward for consideration appropriate policies that advanced the national interest. (5) In the area of law enforcement and counter terrorism the issues were complicated, fast-moving and often sensitive. Government departments needed high-quality comprehensive legal advice for the effective conduct of day-to-day business. The advice needed to be given in a timely fashion to ensure the policy developed in a fully informed way. Legal advisors needed to be able to present the full picture to their clients including not only arguments in support of their conclusions but also the potential counter-arguments, in order to assess the merits of each. (6) Legal advice obtained by government departments often set out – within its reasoning – the perceived weaknesses of the department’s position, or counter-arguments that might be made. That material helped provide the government with comprehensive legal advice. Without such comprehensive advice, the quality of the government’s decision-making would be “much reduced because it would not be fully informed”. 16 DBERR v O’Brien [2009] EWHC 164 (QB): Wyn Williams J [41]. - 17 -(7) Revealing the perceived weaknesses and counter-arguments would provide a clear path the disaffected parties to mount case. It could also create a situation of unfairness since other parties to litigation would not be forced to reveal what legal advice they had received. (8) Disclosure of legal advice would prejudice the government’s ability to defend its legal interests because it would mean unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge thus diminishing the reliance it could place on the advice being fully considered and presented without fear or favour. The former could result in serious consequential loss – or at least in a waste of resources in defending unnecessary challenges – and the latter could result in poorer decision-making. (9) There was also a risk that lawyers and clients would avoid making a permanent record of the advice given, or make any partial record. It was in the public interest that the provision of legal advice was fully recorded in writing. As policy developed or litigation decisions were made it would be important to be able to refer back to advice given along the way. (10) In this case, if the legal advice in question was disclosed in its entirety it would provide – in essence – a road map for future challenges should the government in future decide to amend the framework. The advice set out in great detail the challenges of any changes to the system. The “live” nature of the legal advice is a factor favouring disclosure in the present case. 67. For reasons already explained the Tribunal believes exactly the opposite applies to the withheld information. Disclosure of the legal advice would strengthen the government’s own development of its policy. 68. The Tribunal believes that, on the facts and given the nature of the withheld information in this appeal, just the opposite would obtain if the legal advice was disclosed. Disclosure of the legal advice would assist the administration of justice. 69. It is the Tribunal’s finding that disclosure of this legal advice – far from assisting in the administration of justice – would have a deleterious effect on it for reasons already explained. - 18 -70. In essence, it could provide a “road map” for future challenges should the government at another time decide to amend the framework in this delicate and sensitive area. Disclosure of the summary is not sufficient. 71. There are good reasons relating to the public interest balance why the summary is so carefully cast and why the legal advice lying behind that summary – despite being very detailed – is not elaborated on further. Section 35 (Formulation of government policy, etc) and Section 23 (Information supplied by, or relating to, bodies dealing with security matters). 72. The Tribunal has considered these exemptions. It regards them as ancillary and subsumed by its main finding. 73. That main finding that the Home Office has properly relied on section 42 FOIA, that it is fully engaged and that – when the public interest balancing test is considered and concluded in terms of the fact that it is a qualified exemption – the balance falls squarely and unequivocally in withholding the information and maintaining the legal professional privilege exemption as originally claimed. 74. Our decision is unanimous. 75. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 9 December 2015 - 19 -"
"117","EIR","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL – GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Information Rights Tribunal Reference: EA.2015.0257 Appellant: The Education Authority (Formerly the Belfast Education and Library Board) Respondent: The Information Commissioner Registrar: R Worth Decision Appeal lodged out of time 1. On 9 November 2015 the Tribunal received a notice of appeal from the Education Authority. By that notice the Education Authority sought to appeal against the conclusion(s) of a letter from the Information Commissioner’s Office dated 23 October 2014, reference RFA0549953. 2. An appeal against a decision sent to the appellant on 23 October 2014 should have been lodged with the Tribunal by 20 November 2014. This appeal was lodged almost 1 year late, clearly a very serious breach of the time limit. 3. The reason given for the breach is unpersuasive. Strength of grounds of appeal 4. Very strong grounds of appeal may mean that, despite a very serious breach of the time limit, it is in the interests of justice to admit an appeal. 5. The Education Authority’s case is that the letter of 23 October 2014 is in substance and enforcement notice under s.40(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998. 6. S.40(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 provides: 40(1) If the Commissioner is satisfied that a data controller has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection principles, the Commission may serve him with a notice (in this Act referred to as “an enforcement notice”) requiring him, for complying with the principle or principles in question, to do either or both of the following- (a) ….. 7.

Appellant: The Education Authority Date of decision: 12 November 2015 (a) a statement of the data protection principle or principles which the Commissioner is satisfied have been or are being contravened and his reasons for reaching that conclusion, and (b) particulars of the rights of appeal conferred by section 48 8. The letter dated 23 October 2014 (which does not refer to s.48) states: “It does appear that the Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB), would be likely to be in breach of the legislation, if it continues to process the personal data of ….” (my emphasis) … “Next steps / Action required We would now ask that BELB return to PSNI the documentation that it received, and to then discuss…..” 9. In my view that does not indicate that the Commissioner is satisfied that a data protection principle has been or is being contravened by the Education Authority. It is a warning that they will, in the future, be likely to be found in breach if they continue in certain actions; not a finding of wrongdoing at the present time. 10. The expression “We would now ask” is in my view very far from requiring action as is needed for s.40(1) and s.40(6)(a). 11. Failure to comply with an enforcement notice is a criminal offence punishable with an unlimited fine in the Crown Court (s.47(1) and s.60(2)). The existence of an enforcement notice would have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt if criminal proceedings were brought. 12. Quite apart from the fact that the letter is not described as an enforcement notice, I doubt that the Information Commissioner’s Office would be able to successfully argue in a criminal court that the letter was “in substance” an enforcement notice even though it does not comply with the requirements of s.40 and that therefore they can prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. 13. Facts in this Tribunal do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However without the ultimate sanction of criminal proceedings for non-compliance the document is powerless and it is difficult to see how it could be considered as “probably” an enforcement notice. Effect on Information Commissioner’s Office 14. I take account of the fact that there is little prejudice to the Information Commissioner’s Office in accepting the appeal – other than adding an additional appeal to the number of appeals they are dealing with.Direction Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: Error! Reference source not found. Appellant: The Education Authority Date of decision: 12 November 2015 Decision and reasons 15. In all the circumstances outlined above I do not believe that the Information Commissioner’s Office letter dated 23 October 2014 is an enforcement notice. If it was not an enforcement notice, there is no jurisdiction for this Tribunal to consider the appeal and, if admitted, it would have to be struck out under rule 8. 16. Overall I conclude that it is not appropriate to extend the time limit for appealing. The Education Authority’s appeal is dismissed as out of time. This decision was made by the Tribunal’s Registrar.

January, 2014 the Bracknell News apparently reported that two unnamed Bracknell Forest councillors had failed to pay the council tax due from them. It evidently added further details, which may or may not have been accurate. 2. MW is a local resident and a reader of the Bracknell News. The Request 3. On the day of the report, 2nd. January, 2014, he made the following requests to the Council - “ Under the Freedom of Information Act, please can you supply the relevant informa- tion on - (1) The two Bracknell Forest Councillors, their NAMES or their wards that they repre- sent that have failed to pay their council tax as by 2/01/2014 printed in Bracknell News. (2) Is there any liability orders been made by the council against its councilors to retrieve said monies by deduction from wages? If so can you release the information? AND (3) under the same FOI request I would also like to know has any councillor applied to the council for a tax reduction or a tax discount. If so can you please release the in- formation?” 4. On 10th. January, 2014 MW again requested - “Please provide the names of all councillors referred to in the council’s response to the request from Bracknell News in relation to Council Tax reminders.” 3Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 It is agreed that this is effectively the same request as request 1 of 2nd January, 2014. 5. The Council refused request 1 by email on 4th. February, 2014, relying on FOIA s.40(2). It maintained that position following an internal review. 6. The reply to request 2 was that there had been no liability orders. Request 3 was an- swered in the negative by the Council in an explanatory email to the ICO dated 29th July, 2014. The disputed information is therefore limited to the names and the wards of the councillors referred to as failing to pay council tax when due. 7. Before any review of the DN and the cases presented to the Tribunal it is necessary to refer to an unusual procedural complication which arose in the course of the appeal. 8. At an early stage of the oral hearing it appeared to the Tribunal that the Council may have been treating the request as referring to different councillors in a different financial year from those featured in the Bracknell News. The email of 29th. July, 2014 made clear that its refusal related to two councillors to whom reminders had been sent and who had then paid the tax due. This presumably occurred in the financial year ending 5th. April, 2014. The relevant extract of the Bracknell News had not been exhibited by any party. If the information requested did not match the information refused by the Council, hence the information considered in the DN, then the request would require fresh consideration by the Council and the appeal could not proceed. Brief considera- tion was given to the appropriate order for the Tribunal to make if that were so but we decided that further evidence should be submitted by all parties, if they chose, as to the scope of requests 1 and 2 of 2nd. January, 2014. It was contemplated that MW would serve a copy of the Bracknell News report which would probably resolve any uncer- tainty. Accordingly, directions were given as to service of evidence on this issue and a timetable was set. 4Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 9. The Council served brief evidence and MW made a short written submission which did not include the report and took the matter no further. We extended time to allow him to serve the report but it was not forthcoming. 10. The Tribunal therefore ruled as follows as to the scope of the request and the further conduct of the appeal - “Further Direction 1.1. There will be a further oral hearing, estimated length half a day, at a venue and on a date to be determined. 1.2. The Appellant having failed to produce the newspaper article to which his requests of 2nd. and 10th. January, 2014 refer, despite an extension of time granted by the Tribunal, the Tribunal rules that the scope of these requests is limited to in- formation relating to the two councillors and the year referred to by Mr. Simon Bull of Bracknell Forest Borough Council in his email to Deborah Clark of the ICO dated 29th. July, 2014 at point 1(a) and (b). The relevant passage from the email referred to in paragraph 2 identified the scope of the request as reasonably understood by the Council. It read as follows - “Point 1 a) Both councillors paid on receipt of the first reminder letter. No further re- minder letter or action was required. No court proceedings or debt recovery was neces- sary. b) Mitigating circumstances. In both cases (there) were administrative errors on the part of the councillor or their (sic) banks, which led to the reminder letter being issued. Nei- ther councillor were (sic) disbarred from voting and participating in budget matters as their errors were corrected as soon as they came to light on receipt of the first reminder letter and payment made. So this decision, like the DN, relates to information as to the names of those councillors and/or the wards that they represent. In the event, no further oral hearing took place and MW, having been reminded of his right to conclude the appeal with such a hearing, agreed that the appeal should be decided on the basis of the written submissions and other mate- rial before the Tribunal. Once the scope of the request was defined, it was indeed hard to see what further oral submissions could add to the arguments on either side. No oral evi- dence was contemplated. 5Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 The DN 11. The ICO concluded that both the names of the councillors and the wards that they rep- resented were personal data. 12. He went on to consider whether disclosure would breach any of the data protection principles set out in Schedule 1 Part II to the Data Protection Act, 1998. Focussing on the first data protection principle, he considered whether processing would be fair. He took account of the Council’s evidence as to councillors’ expectations as to publicity as a consequence of the advice which the Council gave to all councillors. Neither council- lor had made any public pronouncement on council tax issues. In both cases the need for the reminder arose from an error and the reminder was promptly heeded. He had regard to the results of comparable cases in Bolton and Cornwall. He decided that dis- closure would be unfair. 13. MW appealed. MW’s case before the Tribunal 14. MW’s case was contained in two emails to the Tribunal dated respectively 7th. August and 12th. December 2014. In the former he referred to various issues raised by the Council at an early stage of the ICO’s investigation which were not considered in the DN. His case as to the s.40(2) exemption may be summarised as this : Councillors are elected by the residents of their wards and those residents are entitled to know if their councillors break the law or fail to conduct their affairs in accordance with codes of conduct expected of those elected to serve on the Council. They should enjoy no ad- vantage by comparison with other council tax payers. The Council was providing them with unjustified protection. His purpose in making his request was not research but dis- closure of the names or wards for the reasons given. He submitted an extract from the Council’s information on late payments of Council Tax taken from its website. 6Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 The case for the ICO 15. The ICO largely adopted the DN. He referred to his decisions, in cases involving Bolton and Cornwall councils, upholding reliance on the s.40(2) exemption in similar circum- stances. In the Bolton case (Haslam v ICO and Bolton Council EA/2014/0029) the Tri- bunal had upheld his decision to dismiss the complaint. The conduct of the two council- lors in the present appeal was less blameworthy than the failings of the councillors in that case. Our reasons 16. MW’s concerns are sincere and understandable, whatever the extenuating circum- stances of this case. However, his request must fail for a reason that he identified in his email of 12th. December, 2014, regardless of other considerations of fairness. 17. He does not dispute that his request involves the personal data of the councillors. In- deed, their names are clearly personal data and the wards that they represent are data from which they could readily be identified by anyone who consulted the Council’s web- site (see DPA s.1 - definition of “personal data”) 18. FOIA s.40(2) provides that information constituting personal data other than exempted by s.40(1), hence personal data of anybody other than the requester, is exempt if “(b) either the first or second condition below is satisfied” 19. S.40(3)(a) sets out the part of the first condition relevant to this and almost every other case involving this exemption. So far as material it reads - “. . .that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public other than under this Act would contravene (i) any of the data protection principles,” 7Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 20. The second condition relates to restrictions on the data subject’s rights of access to his personal data and is therefore irrelevant to this appeal. 21. The data protection principles are set out in Schedule 1 Part 1 to the DPA. The first data principle is the first and generally, as here, the only port of call. It provides - “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless - (a) at least one of the conditions in schedule 2 is met, and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.” These are not sensitive personal data. 22. Compliance with a Schedule 2 condition is therefore an essential ingredient of fair and lawful processing, here disclosure to the public. 23. Condition 6(1) of Schedule 2, to which MW evidently referred in his December email requires that “The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.” None of conditions 1 - 5 in Schedule 2 could possibly apply. 24. Condition 6(1) is intended to cater for persons conducting a course of research for whom access to the data is essential, though it is qualified by consideration of the inter- ests of the data subject. “Interests pursued” plainly imports a requirement for a continu- 8Appeal Number: EA/2014/0201 ing course of study or inquiry, not, as MW frankly acknowledges in his email, the oppor- tunity to name the councillors on one occasion, in a letter to the local paper. The issues of necessity and prejudice to the councillors’ interests do not require consideration. 25. Whatever view the Tribunal takes of the more general considerations of fairness, the use of this exemption must therefore be upheld. No Schedule 2 condition is satis- fied. Disclosure of the councillors’ personal data is therefore unfair, regardless of the considerations advanced by the Council, the ICO and MW. The Tribunal should add that, on the particular facts of this case, as set out by the Council, there was a strong case for saying that disclosure would have been unfair in the general sense adopted in the DN. 26. The same decision based on the failure to satisfy a Schedule 2 condition would have applied equally to a similar request relating to other councillors. To that extent the decision on the scope of this request does not affect the outcome of this appeal. 26. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this appeal. 27. This decision is unanimous.

In 1988 Mr Cowx bought a shop in Maryport, within the area of Allerdale Borough Council (“ABC”). He is concerned that, as a result of demolition work and the construction of a car park near his property many years ago (which may have been carried out for the Council or its predecessor local authority) there has been damage caused to his property. 2. On 25 September 2012 he sent a letter entitled “Notice” to the Council. The second sentence read:- “I now wish to give formal notice of damage caused to the above referenced property, due to the negligence of ABC…” 3. The letter went on to give details of his perception of the damage and asked a series of question:- “..why did ABC not build their own retaining wall to the boundary of their land?.. Could ABC also give a reasonable explanation as to what happened to the sewerage system…? Also I wish to know whom, if anyone, gave consent for ABC to use my part owned boundary wall as a retaining wall?” 4. Mr Cowx followed up the letter on 5 May 2013 and the Council replied on 29 May 2013 giving its understanding of the position and stating “having considered the evidence we do not believe that there is any liability on the Council”. Mr Cowx was dissatisfied, the Council confirmed its position. 5. Mr Cowx responded to this letter making a request for information under FOIA (the “second request” made on 12 July 2013) with respect to the use of powers of compulsory acquisition of properties in the area by ABC or any other local authority and the name of the contractor carrying out the demolition of the properties. In a reference to evidence from pre-contract enquiries made on his behalf to the vendor in 1988 he stated that the owner had had occasion to complain to the Council at that time...”and of course, Allerdale will know fully what the issues were at that time. 3Appeal No: EA/2015/0025 With that in mind I request to see all documentation in Allerdale’s possession which refer to these concerns.” 6. ABC responded by stating that the Property and Legal Section of the Council had checked its records it did not hold any information. 7. On 26 August 2013 Mr Cowx made a further request recapitulating and building on the previous request specifically asking about the nature of the dispute referred to in the 1988 document. The Council asked for further details of the dispute, and then on 4 October 2013 indicated that as Mr Cowx had not been able to give any further details it searches had been unable to find more than had already been disclosed, it suggested that the development of the land as a car park might not have required planning permission as it was within the Council’s permitted development rights. Mr Cowx remained dissatisfied; the Council carried out an internal review and maintained its position. Mr Cowx complained to the Respondent the “Commissioner”. 8. The Commissioner investigated, looking at the explanations given by ABC why the information requested was not held and making his determination of the issue on the balance of probabilities. He considered the explanations provided by the Council why information was not held (DN paragraphs 18, 20-23). This explained that much documentation would have been destroyed when land in the area was registered with the Land Registry in 1997, that it had treated the first letter as a claim and that it did not hold information on soakaways and sewers related to the land. With respect to the second letter, it was possible the acquisition and clearance happened about 1974 – when the Council was set up, but while it could confirm that it held the land and had registered it in 1997 it held no more information. 9. The Commissioner could not identify any reason why ABC should be withholding information and concluded that the information was not held and the Council was not in breach of its duty under EIR. 10. Mr Cowx appealed against this finding arguing that the Commissioner had erred in coming to his conclusion. The Commissioner resisted the appeal reaffirming and expanding his reasoning. 4Appeal No: EA/2015/0025 11. In the hearing Mr Cowx explained at length the situation on the ground using a number of photographs. His concern was the underlying dispute. He stated: “My argument is that Allerdale created an embankment over intervening property using my boundary wall” …”The Council created the problem by installing an embankment on their property”…”constructed without proper attention to drainage.” 12. He was suspicious at the claim that ABC had destroyed all the files “while at the same time retaining files on other property – keeping 1970 information...it doesn’t seem to stack up.”…”If they’ve got a file, what’s on it” He referred to a dispute with ABC in respect of a planning issue relating to another property he owned in the area (some 10 years before) where he had complained and ascribed bad faith to the author of the letter responding to his “notice”. He had thought that the Council’s initial response to him was “threatening”. There had been difficulty with water ingress to an adjacent yard in 2003, tests had been carried out and it had been suggested that sewers in his property were responsible. The question for the Tribunal 13. The simple question for the tribunal is whether the Commissioner’s decision is correct to find on the balance of probabilities that ABC does not hold any further information within the scope of the requests. 14. Mr Cowx is suspicious of ABC and disinclined to trust them. He claimed that the response to his first letter was “threatening”. Although Mr Cowx disputed this when it was put to him, his initial letter was clearly a letter advancing a claim against ABC which was properly treated by ABC as a claim and passed to its legal department to respond to. The contents of the letter were a proper and appropriate response to what was clearly a notification of a claim. 15. Mr Cowx produced two documents to the Tribunal which he felt were convincing evidence that there must be further information held. They are not. His “evidence” of what he claims is an ABC file dating back to 1970 giving information about a nearby property is not evidence of such a file – it is a part of a Land Registry copy of a registered title which was registered on 1 December 1997 by ABC to establish its ownership of land at the Land Registry. This registration was carried out by reference to the interest in land which was subject to some right reserved to another person. Since Mr Cowx has only provided the first page of the official copy of the registered 5Appeal No: EA/2015/0025 title the Tribunal is not aware of what that right is – but the fact that the Land Registry extracted details of that right from a conveyance in 1970 when it created the registered title does not mean that ABC has a file now – only that in 1997 the Land Registry had a duty to fully describe the registrable interests in the land when it created the entry. 16. ABC, once its title was secured in the Land Registry, would have no further need for any of the documents from its 1970 conveyancing file. 17. The other piece of documentary evidence produced by Mr Cowx is equally tenuous. In the pre-contractual enquiries his solicitor made on his behalf of the vendor who sold him his shop in 1988 under the heading of “Disputes” is the query:- “During the past 3 years, has the Vendor complained or had cause to complain about the state and condition, or the manner of use, of any adjoining or neighbouring property? If so, please give particulars” 18. The information provided by the Vendor was:- “Only the Council Development of a car park on Furnace Lane but this has been settled” 19. What this is evidence of is that, at least 24 years before Mr Cowx made his requests for information, his predecessor in title complained to the Council about the car park and the dispute was settled at that time. 20. Here again it is clear that there is no reason why a Council should retain a record of a complaint that has been settled for decades. Conclusion and remedy 21. Mr Cowx is aggrieved and suspicious. He sees a nearby ABC carpark as the source of his problems. He believes that ABC should possess records which will establish that they made mistakes and it is possible that he believes that it should compensate him (in his submissions to the Tribunal he was inconsistent as to whether he thought that he had a claim). 22. The Commissioner investigated his complaint and concluded that ABC had looked where it could for information to answer Mr Cowx’s questions. He was satisfied that no information was held. 6Appeal No: EA/2015/0025 23. Mr Cowx has produced documentary evidence decades old which does not give any grounds for believing that ABC hold further records. There is simply no business case for the retention of such old records. Normal retention policies in any organisation would have disposed of them decades ago. 24. Mr Cowx’s generalised suspicion is not grounds for disputing the propriety with which ABC conducted its search or the basis upon which the Commissioner made his decision. 25. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Commissioner’s decision is correct in law and dismisses the appeal. 26. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 18 July 2015 7"
"126","EIR","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2014/0179 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) BETWEEN HAYDN NEWTON Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Tribunal Brian Kennedy QC Michael Hake Suzanne Cosgrave Hearing: 15 April 2015. Location: Leeds. Decision: Appeal Refused. Subject Matter: Disclosure of information the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and reliance by the Public Authority, the Sheffield City Council (”the Council”), on Section 14(1) in the fact that they regard the requests as vaxa- tious. Introduction: 1. This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the FOIA. The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the DN”) dated 24 June 2014 (reference FS50529749), which is a matter of public record. 2. An oral hearing took place on 15 April 2015 the Appellant only in atten- dance the Commissioner having given his reasons for opposing the Appeal in his Response dated 18 August 2014 to the Grounds of Appeal dated 16July 2014. The Tribunal has been provided with a paginated (1- 270) and in- dexed Open Bundle (“OB”). Background: 3. On 11 November 2013 the Appellant wrote to the Council in the following terms: “Please provide all up to date documentation which states, or will provide supporting evidence, to establish why a member of the council tax paying public has no right to make more than one complaint to Sheffield City Council, and have that complaint investigated under Sheffield City Coun- cil's Complaints procedure and have that complaint forwarded to the om- budsman office. Excluding all FOIA (2000) Act documentation provided already.”. “Now as per Amy Carters e-mail on 2 March 2012 at 16.47, please supply the following under the FOIA (2000) Act. All documentation relating to the bowling green is run by volunteers and a crown green bowling association. Excluding all FOIA (2000) Act documentation provided already. 4. During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Appellant made the Commissioner aware of another request made on the same date which was as follows: “How much financial assistance as Sheffield City Council given, donated or provided to every bowling club of which Sheffield City Council own, from January 2012 to September 2013 inclusive.” 5. On 14 November 2013 the Council responded refusing to provide the re- quested information stating that it considered the first two requests per vexatious for the purposes of section 14 FOIA. 6. The Appellant requested an internal review on 21 November 2013 and the Council responded on 11 December 2013, maintaining its position. 7. On 24 December 2013 the Appellant complained to the Commissioner and the Commissioner investigated that complaint. 8. The Commissioner considered that the scope of his investigation covered all three of the Appellant's requests. During his investigation, the Council confirmed that it also wished to apply section 14 (1) FOIA to the third of the Appellant's requests, as well as the first two. 9. Accordingly, the Commissioner considered whether the Council was correct to apply section 14(1) FOIA to the Appellant's three requests of 11 November 2013. He concluded that the Council had correctly relied onsection 14 in relation to the requests of the Council was therefore not re- quired to respond to those requests. The Legal Framework: 10. Section 14(1) FOIA provides that section 1(1) does not oblige a public au- thority to comply with a request for information if the request is “vexa- tious”. 11. FOIA does not define the term vexatious. However, the Upper Tribunal has considered the meaning of the term vexatious at section 14 FOIA in detail in its decision in The Information Commissioner V Devon County Council & Dransfield GIA/3037/2011. Its overall analysis of what may constitute a vex- atious request under section 14 FOIA is found at paragraphs 24 to 39 of that judgment. 12. The Commissioner in his submissions reminds the tribunal of a number of citations in the Dransfield case. However the Court of Appeal has reviewed Dransfield: - Neutral Citation Number: [2015] EWCA Civ. 454 at Para 68: “ In my Judgment, the UT was right not to attempt to provide any comprehensive or exhaustive definition. It would be better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise. However, for my own part, in the context of FOIA, I consider that the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word, which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the rel- evant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a re- quest is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can be discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which vexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out of venge- ance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were improp- erly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable foundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the re- quest was aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly available. “ The Commissioner’s Investigation and DN: 13. The Commissioner carried out a careful and detailed analysis in his DN and concluded that all three of the Appellant’s information requests were vexa- tious for the purpose of section 14 FOIA, See paragraphs 11 – 24 of the DN [pages 3 to 6 OB]. He later summarized these helpfully for this Tribunal thus;- when taken in its proper context and history, the requests were signifi- cantly burdensome in terms of both expense and distraction (see para- graphs 16 to 18 of the DN); - the requests were lacking in serious purpose or value (see paragraphs 19 to 23 DN) and - the requests would have the effect of harassing and causing distress to council staff (see paragraph 24 DN). 14. In reaching this conclusion, the Commissioner did, in our view, consider all relevant circumstances and, we find properly, balance the arguments put forward by the Council and the information provided by the Appellant. Ultimately, the Commissioner concluded that the Council was correct to apply section 14 FOIA to the requests in this case. This Tribunal have looked carefully and considered the reasoning within the DN (at para- graphs 11 – 24), we regard it as sound and agree and adopt that reasoning. This is after we have heard the evidence of the Appellant himself. The Commissioner’s Response to the Grounds of Appeal: 15. Generally, we accept the Commissioners submission that the Appellant has failed to identify either an error of Law or any incorrect exercise of his discretion. The Evidence: The Appellant gave evidence to the Tribunal in person and made his sub- missions over a number of hours at the oral haring. He confirmed the large number of requests he had made to the Council and identified the volumi- nous correspondence from himself and members of his family to the Council over a protracted period of time. The Tribunal took him from page 134 to page 164 of the HB through what is a summary of communications to the Council from the Appellant and members of his family. We explained to the Appellant that the Council argues that early communications on their own might seem like reasonable requests, but when taken together over a number of years, they did become a burden. These requests commenced in March 2009 continuing to January 2014. He did not dispute the details as we took him through each of them nor did he dispute that he had made threats to staff about going to the Information Commissioner and the South Yorkshire Police. He said, himself to us “ … they (his requests/complaints) took on a life of their own”. The DN sets out clearly the nature of the requests, which were reasonable at the outset, and dealt with, only to be raised repeatedly over a number of years in various guises, but fundamen- tally the same issues. 16. He took a considerable time outlining his grievances. He insisted that he had grievances as a result of the way the Council had treated him as time went on and that he was a victim but failed to demonstrate precisely howthis was so. He did speak of a court case after the Council had referred him to the Police. Criminal charges resulted but he claimed “The magistrates threw it out, saying there was no case to answer”. He stated that: “The Council seem to think they’re God. They don’t care about my rights.”. He claimed the South Yorkshire Police are investigating the Council as a result but gave no further details. 17. The Appellant confirmed that he was frustrated and criticised the manner in which the Council had dealt with him and he had expressed this frustra- tion against the Council. Reasons: 18. The Tribunal accepts and adopts the Commissioner’s reasoning through- out the DN. In fact the Appellant does not argue to any significant degree that the Commissioner is flawed in his reasoning. Rather he seems to ar- gue that the Commissioner has been misled. The Appellant argues, not against the reasoning in the DN per se, except to say that it cannot be right because the Council simply regard and treat him as a nuisance and that, in his view, is not a reason for refusing to deal with his requests. In fact the Commissioner has recognized this in his DN but explains why it is that the request has, in all the circumstances of this case and particularly the his- tory, become vexatious. This Tribunal finds, in the papers before us and through the evidence of the Appellant that the requests from the Appellant had become a burden on the Council. There was unreasonable persistence and frequent overlapping of requests as we discovered when we took him through the summaries at pages 134 to 164 of the HB. We find that the culmination of the communica- tions and requests from the Appellant and his family had reached such a stage on 11 November 2013 that the requests made at that time were likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption, irritation or distress in relation to such serious purpose and value that the original re- quests did have. 19. The Tribunal in preparing its decision has noted the Court of Appeal judg- ment in Dransfield (referred to at paragraph 12 above) and in particular Para. 72 which says: “…. Before I leave this appeal I note that the UT held that the purpose of section 14 was “to protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA” (UT, Dransfield, Judgment, para. 10). For my own part, I would wish to qualify that aim as one only to be realised if the high standard set by vexatious- ness is satisfied.” We are satisfied that the history of requests in this case is such through their prolonged duration and ultimately, lack of serious purpose or value, that the requisite high standard of vexatiousness is satisfied and the re- sources of the public authority should be protected.20. For the reasons above and adopting a holistic approach, in all the circum- stances, of this case we find that the Commissioner was correct in the rea- soning he applied in his DN. Having listened carefully to the Appellant he does not persuade us that the Commissioner was wrong in his conclusion that the requests were vexatious. We find the Commissioner was correct and the DN should stand. Accordingly we refuse the appeal. Brian Kennedy QC 5th June 2015."

DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal upholds the decision notice dated 27 August 2014 and dismisses the appeal. REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. The Appellant was concerned about the fitness to practise of two named nurses who had been involved in the care of his partner. 2. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) considered the issues he raised and told him that no case to answer had been found against the nurses. 3. On being informed of that he asked the NMC, on 12 January 2014, for ….all the information which made up the process. Specifically you make reference to evidence which I am not clear I have seen including that of the other witnesses. 4. On 20 February 2014 the NMC responded. It refused to confirm or deny (NCND) whether it held the requested information under s.40 (5) (b) FOIA on -2-the basis that to confirm the information was held would, in itself, disclose personal data in breach of the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998. 5. The Appellant believed that there was a strong public interest in disclosing the information because of child safety and protection issues and complained to the Information Commissioner. 6. The Information Commissioner concluded that s.40 (5) applied and that the NMC did not have to confirm or deny whether the requested information was held. 7. The identity of the Appellant, his family, the nurses involved, the hospital and its location are not disclosed in this decision following the agreement of all the parties at the oral appeal hearing. 8. The Appellant explained to the Tribunal in detail the background and history that had led to his FOIA complaint. None of that is covered in this decision because such details could lead to “jigsaw identification” and destroy the purpose of anonymisation. Preliminary Issues at the Oral Hearing 9. The Appellant sought an adjournment at the oral hearing on the basis that the bundle of documents prepared for the Tribunal’s and the parties did not reflect all the information he believed should have been included and also that there had been late service of a witness statement in relation to the NMC’s presentation of its case. 10. The Chamber President, Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane, had reviewed matters ahead of the oral hearing – particularly in relation to representations made by the Appellant on these topics – in a Case Management Note dated 29 January 2015. 11. He had noted that it would be for the Tribunal at the hearing to keep in mind the requirements of procedural fairness. -3-12. Having heard all the parties present at the oral appeal on the application for the adjournment the Tribunal retired and considered the matter for 45 minutes. 13. It declined to grant the adjournment on the basis that it was fair, just and proportionate to continue with the hearing. 14. This was because the matter was finally balanced but the focus of the appeal was narrow and limited. The Appellant was appearing as a litigant in person but he was also professionally qualified and the Tribunal was satisfied that it would be able to ensure that he could participate fully in the proceedings. 15. The Tribunal, in refusing the adjournment, was also conscious of avoiding delay so far as was compatible with proper consideration of the issues given that the NMC was represented by leading counsel whose availability for an adjourned hearing might well add further time before any final adjudication. The Law 16. Section 40 FOIA states: Personal information. (1) Any information to which a request for information relates is exempt information if it constitutes personal data of which the applicant is the data subject. (2) Any information to which a request for information relates is also exempt information if— (a) it constitutes personal data which do not fall within subsection (1), and (b) either the first or the second condition below is satisfied. (3) The first condition is— (a) in a case where the information falls within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene— (i) any of the data protection principles, or -4-(ii) section 10 of that Act (right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress), and (b) in any other case, that the disclosure of the information to a member of the public otherwise than under this Act would contravene any of the data protection principles if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (which relate to manual data held by public authorities) were disregarded. (4) The second condition is that by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(c) of that Act (data subject’s right of access to personal data). (5) The duty to confirm or deny— (a) does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1), and (b) does not arise in relation to other information if or to the extent that either— (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 or would do so if the exemptions in section 33A(1) of that Act were disregarded, or (ii) by virtue of any provision of Part IV of the Data Protection Act 1998 the information is exempt from section 7(1)(a) of that Act (data subject’s right to be informed whether personal data being processed). 17. It is section 40 (5) (b) (i) – italicised immediately above – on which the NMC relies. Oral Evidence 18. The Tribunal heard oral evidence – on which he was cross-examined – from Mr John Lucarroti, the Head of Fitness to Practice Policy and Legislation at the NMC. He adopted his written witness statement dated 23 January 2015. 19. He provided a brief background on the NMC, his role within the NMC, the NMC’s fitness to practice policies and procedures and commented on what -5-he believed would be the adverse impact on the NMC and its registrants of this appeal succeeding. 20. In relation to the latter he maintained, in cross-examination, that the appeal raised the key issue which was importance both to the NMC and to other professional disciplinary bodies more generally. The NMC – and other regulators – had a duty to treat its registrants fairly by conducting the initial stages of investigations in private and maintaining that privacy when assessing requests for information by those such as the Appellant. 21. The NMC received numerous requests for information about its fitness to practice investigations from other third parties including journalists. 22. There had been 4860 fitness to practice cases that were closed or concluded between 2013/2014. 1503 cases had been closed on initial screening, 1404 cases had been closed by the Investigating Committee and 1805 cases concluded in the Conduct and Competence committee or the Health Committee. 92 cases had been concluded through voluntary removal and 12 cases of fraudulent or incorrect entry on a register were concluded. 23. In his experience a sizeable number of complaints which reached the Investigating Committee had no evidential basis and were potentially defamatory in nature. If they had been made public at an early stage they would have had the potential to cause significant reputational harm to the registrants. 24. So as to support the authority and credibility of its investigation process, the NMC required the capacity to reject requests for information where an investigation was ongoing or if it had been closed at an early stage. 25. Any removal of that option would undermine the integrity and efficacy of the NMC’s investigation procedures. That could prove damaging for all parties including registrants, complainants and the public. -6-The Appellant’s Position 26. In C’s Grounds of Appeal and the submissions – the main points of which are summarised below – he maintains in essence that the Information Commissioner and the NMC have taken an absolutist position because he knows the information he is seeking because it has already been disclosed to him, by other processes, privately. 27. On that basis it would be possible for him to upload the details of the nurses concerned in the case to any website he might create and, in doing so, he would simply be providing factual information about a matter of public importance. 28. Simply because he held the information in a “private” capacity should not prevent the NMC disclosing it to him in the context of this FOIA request. 29. He believed there was a legitimate interest for a member of the public (like him) who had made a complaint to the NMC to understand the process through which and the information on which it had adjudicated in respect of the complaint. The processing of the personal data in question was necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest being pursued by him (as a third party). 30. The information could be obtained by an application for pre-action disclosure in the High Court. In that context he maintained that there was a legitimate interest of a member of the public being encouraged to avoid the High Court legal process with all its complexity and expense by allowing simple disclosure of the information requested under FOIA. 31. He did not believe that the NMC could rely on the Data Protection Act because that simply created a circular argument. Neither the Information Commissioner nor the NMC had identified any other right or freedom which justified their respective positions. -7-32. There had been no consideration of the provisions of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act relating to “fairness” and no analysis of the elements which went to make up the assertion that disclosure would not be “fair”. There seemed to be no balancing of what would be fair as between the interests of disclosure and any interests in non-disclosure. The concept of “fairness” had only been applied to the apparent interests of the registrants (the nurses involved in this case). 33. There needed to be a balance between his interests in having the information made public and the likely consequences to the data subjects of any interference with their legitimate interests. Such interference had to be sufficiently substantial to make disclosure “unwarranted” and, in the context of him knowing privately the information which he did, it was not unwarranted. 34. He had taken High Court action which had succeeded, notwithstanding the Information Commissioner’s assertions that there appeared to be nothing wrong with the decision-making process. 35. Following his High Court action the matters were returned to a differently constituted NMC Investigating Committee. That committee had found there was a case to answer in relation to one allegation against one of the nurses but found no case to answer against the other or on any other allegation. 36. When he then asked for information identical to the request under appeal the NMC had asked the nurse in question/ data subject and provided the information requested. 37. The nurse in question had not taken the position that there was a legitimate interest in non-disclosure and it was clear (to the Appellant) that it was the interests of the NMC rather than those of the data subject which were being addressed in the refusal to confirm or deny his request in this appeal. -8-Conclusion and remedy 38. The question facing the Tribunal in this appeal is straightforward. Would giving the information to a member of the public - in terms of confirming or denying that the information existed - breach this “NCND” provision of FOIA and amount to the processing of personal data in the context of the data protection principles? 39. The Tribunal is satisfied that, to confirm or deny to a member of the public whether it held the requested information, the NMC would inevitably be disclosing publicly that a complaint had been made regarding the fitness to practice of (in this case) two named registrants. That inevitably involves the NMC processing the personal data of those registrants. 40. The NMC would be disclosing something about the contents of the information that it held regarding those individuals. It would be making public an important and significant fact about them. 41. The Appellant maintains that - because he knows the information he was seeking in the information request via another route - the statutory restrictions in relation to NCND, disclosure and data processing create bizarre practical situation which is not properly reflected in the legislation and which should, in effect and in the public interest, be corrected in this appeal. 42. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. Disclosure under FOIA means disclosure to the world in general and involves putting the requested information into the public domain. Even confirming or denying its existence does just the same thing. 43. The fact that the Appellant knows the information is not a “lever” that dis- applies those statutory provisions so that he can “bootstrap” himself into the position he seeks. To say that disclosure under FOIA should be made to him would be to say that disclosure should be made to anyone else making a similar request. That cannot be right. -9-44. If the NMC disclosed to a member of the public – by putting the information into the public domain – the fact that a complaint had been made about two registrants it would clearly breach the first data protection principles. It would be unfair in respect of them and would not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 45. In terms of fairness – and this was covered in detail in Mr Lucarotti’s evidence which we accept as both cogent and credible – when a complaint is made to the NMC about a registrant’s fitness to practice than the actual existence of the complaint and its details are not routinely made public. It is only where the NMC’s Investigation Committee decides that there is a case to answer that the existence and details of the complaint are made public. 46. The sequence of the process is that, if it clears the hurdle of the Investigating Committee, it is referred to the Conduct and Competence Committee (which sits in public) or the Health Committee. The Health Committee sits in private because it deals with information about the registrants’ health. That said, notices of both such hearings and decisions are published and the notices and decisions contained the names of the registrants and the detail of the charges together with a detailed decision (with any health information redacted). 47. The Tribunal accepts that the NMC has not made public – at the date of the information request – the fact that complaints had been made against these two individuals. For the NMC to do this would amount to a public and official confirmation that a complaint has been made against them. It would be unfair to them and would contravene their reasonable and legitimate expectations about how their personal information was handled by the NMC. 48. As Mr Lucarotti explained, in his experience a sizeable number of complaints which reach the Investigating Committee had no evidential basis and were potentially defamatory in nature. If they had been made public at an early stage they would have had the potential to cause significant reputational harm to the registrants. - 10 -49. Dealing with Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act, the Tribunal agrees that the only relevant condition in that Schedule is Paragraph 6. That applies when the processing is: necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. 50. The Tribunal finds that such disclosure would not be “necessary” for the purposes of any legitimate public interest. Public scrutiny of the NMC’s functions in this area does create a legitimate interest but that does not require that the existence of complaints which have not yet been referred further to be made public. 51. As the NMC points out, any legitimate interest can be met by way of the Judicial Review process – as it was in the present case – and that allowed an individual with a sufficient interest successfully to challenge the NMC’s decisions regarding the handling of fitness to practice complaints. 52. For similar reasons, such disclosure would be “unwarranted” because of the prejudice to the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the two registrants (who are also the data subjects and to whom the request relates). 53. The Tribunal was referred to – and has considered the effect of – all the existing case law. It finds, against that background, in the present case at the time of the request there was nothing in the public domain to indicate whether or not the requested information existed or was held by the NMC. 54. Specifically, the NMC itself had not publicly disclosed whether the relevant information existed or was held, no other personal body had disclosed such information, the Appellant’s complaint to the Ombudsman about the two registrants had been made before his complaint to the NMC and had not resulted in that complaint been made public, the Appellant’s application for Judicial Review was dealt with without a hearing and did not result in the - 11 -existence of his complaint about the two registrants being made public and the information disclosed to him in those proceedings was not put into the public domain. 55. For all these reasons the Tribunal is satisfied that the NMC correctly relied on the provisions of section 40 (5) FOIA and that this appeal must fail. 56. Our decision is unanimous. 57. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 11 March 2015 - 12 -"

SUBSTITUTED DECISION NOTICE Dated 16 MARCH 2015 Public authority: NHS ENGLAND Name of Complainant: Ms P Fender The Substituted Decision For the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s determination, the Tribunal allows the appeal and substitutes the following decision notice in place of the decision notice dated 6 October 2014. -2-Action Required NHS England is to review all the information it holds in terms of correspondence relating to the Appellant’s healthcare construed in its broadest sense – in the context of FOIA rather than the limited terms it has adopted in terms of the personal data of the Appellant - and disclose to the Appellant, within 31 days, any additional material that is not covered by section 40 (1). An example of this would be any documents similar to an email from NHS England dated 16 August 2013 (Document A at page 14 in the Appeal Bundle). Robin Callender Smith Judge 16 March 2015 REASONS FOR DECISION Background 1. Ms P Fender (the Appellant) asked NHS England (the Second Respondent) on 14 January 2014 for copies of ….the entire correspondence relating to my healthcare between yourself, NHS England, Arden, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire and the GP practice at (name redacted) Hereford to include records of any telephone conversations [emphasis added]. 2. Subsequently, the Information Commissioner on 2 June 2014 (FS 50540516) had required NHS England to issue the Appellant with a response to this request under the provisions of section 10 (1) FOIA because no response had been forthcoming at all. 3. When it did issue her with a response, NHS England applied section 40 (1) FOIA to refuse to disclose the information because it believed that what it held was personal data in relation to the Appellant. -3-4. It had, however, treated the request for information “relating to your health care” under the Data Protection Act 1998 and provided the Appellant with all the information it believed that it held in respect of that. 5. As the Appellant points out in the document lodging her appeal (at page 9 in the Appeal bundle) she was seeking copies of “all the correspondence I had requested. Only a limited amount has been provided” [emphasis added]. 6. The Information Commissioner upheld the approach adopted by NHS England. The appeal to the Tribunal 7. In her 3-page Grounds of Appeal – and at the oral hearing of the appeal Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on 16 February 2015 – the Appellant set out carefully the chronology of the request, the responses to it and the reasons why she felt that not all the information that she was seeking had been correctly assessed and provided by NHS England or, in terms of confirmation of its decision, by the Information Commissioner. 8. She explained that early in January 2013 she had learned that residents in Herefordshire, England, registered with the GP practice in Wales had lost their rights within the NHS Constitution England as a result of the devolved Welsh health service. There had been no consultation or community involvement in respect of that change. 9. She believed NHS England had a responsibility to provide healthcare to residents in England and that the Area Team had a duty to ensure that every Herefordshire resident could access primary medical care within the country. 10. On 26 April 2013, as she was resident in Herefordshire, she withdrew her registration from the GP practice in Wales so that she could receive -4-healthcare in Herefordshire. She corresponded with the Director of Commissioning for Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire (Mrs Sue Price). 11. The Appellant was told that she could register with the GP practice in Herefordshire but when she spoke to the GP practice manager she was told she could not register because she lived too far outside the catchment area. She found herself locked in an impasse on this point. 12. The Appellant, in several emails, asked Mrs Price for clarification of the information that she had been given including the meaning of “allocation”. To try to find out the true situation she made her Freedom of Information request for copies of correspondence between Mrs Price, her team and the GP practice. 13. She believed she had applied under the correct legislation because no personal information was required to be disclosed in order to seek a GP practice with whom to register and that had been confirmed in an email from Mrs Price to the GP practice manager requesting that “a resident in Herefordshire” could register. 14. There was nothing in that email (dated 16 August 2013) which identified her because it could equally apply to any other female resident in Welsh Newton 15. On 5 September 2013 – after much correspondence about the failure of NHS England to provide primary medical care for all residents in Herefordshire – the Appellant had made a formal complaint to Mrs. Price. That complaint was eventually logged on 1 April 2014. 16. Although she had not requested it she was then provided with the complaint file. -5-17. There was no further correspondence in the complaint file from the GP practice, nor from NHS England to state that an agreement had been reached to enable residents in Welsh Newton to register with the GP practice in Herefordshire. 18. She believed there must have been more correspondence between those parties so that a decision could be made. In that case there had to be additional correspondence “in relation to her healthcare” generally which had not been disclosed to her under FOIA and which was not necessarily personal data subject to section 40 (1). The question for the Tribunal 19. The issue before the Tribunal is, in effect, whether NHS England and the Information Commissioner have construed too narrowly the effect of responding to a request for “copies of the entire correspondence relating to my healthcare….” and seen it only as a request for her personal medical records rather than all the information that related to her attempt to clarify her position in terms of registering with a GP practice that was not in Wales. The Hearing 20. We heard oral submissions from Mr Chris Whitehall who attended the appeal hearing on behalf of NHS England. 21. In essence his position was that the information request was, in accordance with their general approach, perceived by NHS England in the context of any request relating to “healthcare” was equivalent to the Appellant’s “medical records”. -6-Conclusion and remedy 22. The Tribunal finds that both NHS England and the Information Commissioner unnecessarily limited the scope of the Appellant’s information request. 23. By treating her request of 14 January 2014 as a limited request only for her medical records it ignored the context of what she was, and clearly had been, seeking , namely all the correspondence The Appellant’s letter of 4 July 2014 comprising her request for an Internal Review stated that her request was “for copies of correspondence on GP registration” thus drawing a clear distinction between the scope of the actual request and the NHS England interpretation that the request was for personal information. 24. As she not unreasonably points out, when her complaint file arrived out of the blue, she expected to see within that file further correspondence from the GP practice and from NHS England about how the position of people like her was being resolved and indicating how an agreement was to be reached to enable residents in Welsh Newton to register with the GP practice in Herefordshire. 25. We find that her belief that there must have been more correspondence between those parties so that a decision could be made is both rational and reasonable. 26. In that case there is likely to be additional correspondence “in relation to her healthcare” generally which had not been disclosed to her under FOIA and which was not necessarily personal data subject to section 40 (1). 27. The Tribunal – and we hope the Appellant – takes some comfort from the presence of Mr Whitehall on behalf of NHS England at the oral appeal. He made it clear that he would revisit the issue at the conclusion of the appeal to see whether, in terms of a much broader interpretation of “healthcare” -7-there was the kind of further documentation that should have been disclosed to the Appellant. 28. If that has not occurred then, as a result of this Substituted Decision Notice, NHS England must revisit the issue and search beyond the narrow confines of the Appellant’s purely personal data. 29. Our decision is unanimous. 30. There is no order as to costs. Robin Callender Smith Judge 16 March 2015 -8-"
"133","EIR","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No. EA/2014/0215 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50536914 Dated: 7th. August, 2014 Appellant: Dr. Muhammud. S, Humayun (“MSH”) First Respondent: The Information Commissioner (“the ICO”) Second Respondent: The General Medical Council (“the GMC”) Before David Farrer Q.C.

Timothy Pitt - Payne Q.C. appeared for the GMC. The ICO did not appear but made written submissions. 1Subject matter: Whether the Appellant’s request was vexatious for the purposes of FOIA s.14 Cases: Dransfield v ICO and Devon County Council [2012] UKUT 440 (“Dransfield”) DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal dismisses the appeal. Dated this 19th. day of February, 2015 David Farrer Q.C. Judge [Signed on original] The Decision Introduction 1. MSH is a general practitioner practising within Heywood, Middleton and Roch- dale PCT (“HMRPCT”). 2. On three occasions, the last in about 2008, he has been referred by HMRPCT to the GMC for investigation of his fitness to practise. MSH, in reply, submitted to the GMC a series of serious complaints regarding the doctors in- 2volved in the referrals, evidently on the basis that, if such complaints were sus- tained, their evidence of his alleged unfitness would be undermined or wholly discredited. The resulting investigations involved a temporary suspension of MSH in advance of any finding. They were all concluded by GMC examiners with the assistance of an expert’s report. This Tribunal is not concerned with the nature of the allegations involved nor are the examiners’ findings material to the issues in this appeal. 3. MSH was dissatisfied with the GMC’s handling of the referrals and corre- sponded with GMC officers from about 2009 and continued until after the re- quests with which this appeal is concerned. He accused the GMC, expressly or by clear implication, of racial, religious and age - related discrimination. 4. His complaints as to the GMC’s handling of his case were reviewed by the GMC’s external legal examiners. Significant delays followed, as the GMC ac- knowledged. Following the examiners’ report to the GMC, Christine Couchman, Head of the Deputy Chief Executive’s office and Corporate Complaints Man- ager, wrote a very detailed letter to MSH dated 29th. February, 2012 in which she expressed her satisfaction that the external examiners, in reviewing both the handling of the clinical complaints against MSH and his complaints as to the conduct and motivation of those responsible for the referrals, had acted fairly and impartially and applied the appropriate test as to conducting further investi- gations. She, as the responsible officer of the GMC, was satisfied that MSH had not been the victim of discrimination on the ground of race, religion, age or any other deliberate injustice. 5. Ms. Couchman’s expressed hope that her definitive analysis of the issues and the GMC’s conclusions would bring the prolific correspondence to an end was not fulfilled. MSH then wrote a large number of letters to the GMC Chair, Council members and officers which were logged and attached later to a letter from the GMC to the ICO dated 18th. July, 2014, responding to his inquiries into MSH’s 3complaint (see paragraph 10). Those letters raised with a wide range of senior GMC figures the complaints which arose from the referrals. 6. Additionally, MSH made a series of FOIA requests, four in 2012 and eight in 2013, largely relating to the racial origins and religion of doctors referred to the GMC by PCTs. He also made requests under the Data Protection Act 1998 (""DPA""). The last FOIA request gives rise to this appeal. The Request 7. By letter of 12th. December, 2013 MSH requested the following information from the GMC - 1 Copy of conversation between A of Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale PCT and B of the GMC. 2 Copy of the Advice given by B to A. 3 Job title and job description of B. 4 How many advices B has given to the PCTs in the last ten years about the doctors. 5 Ethnicity of origin and age of those doctors about whom he gave the advices. A and B had featured in the referral procedures in MSH’s case. 8. The GMC acknowledged the request on the same day, stating that the GMC would consider it by reference both to FOIA and the DPA. 9. It provided a substantive response on 30th. January, 2014. As to (1) and (2), it stated that the information requested had been provided on 24th. August, 2012 4in so far as it was his personal data but other data had been redacted. Clearly, MSH’s personal data could not be provided in answer to a FOIA request (s. 40(1)). 10. As to (3) - (5) the GMC treated them as vexatious requests citing s.14(1) of FOIA. MSH sought an internal review on 31st. January, 2014, which was re- fused on 1st. May, 2014, long after the date for a response prescribed by the ICO. The complaint to the ICO 11. MSH did not wait for that refusal but complained to the ICO on 1st. April, 2014. The ICO commenced an investigation which produced in response the GMC letter of 18th. July, 2014, already referred to. The Decision Notice (“the DN”) 12. The ICO had regard to the “holistic” approach recommended in Dransfield and the particular features of the request to which the ICO or the Tribunal would need to have regard. He characterised MSH’s stance as a stubborn refusal to accept that the issues surrounding his complaints had been determined, albeit not as he would have wanted. He considered the requests taken in the context of the previous history burdensome and of very limited value. They were de- signed to disrupt and to retaliate against decisions with which MSH disagreed. He upheld the GMC’s decision to treat requests 3 - 5 as vexatious. The Appeal 13. MSH appealed, stating, in effect, that the ICO’s decision was wrong because he had failed to understand the importance of the information sought in requests 3 - 5. It was essential to the vindication of MSH’s belief that B gave vexatious ad- 5vice to the GMC and might be guilty of racist and discriminatory conduct in his role with the GMC. He contended that the GMC, in collaboration with HMRPCT, was discriminating against and victimising certain doctors on the grounds of age, race and religion. He accused the GMC of supporting a crimi- nal against MSH, one who defrauded MSH and others. (This was a reference to the conviction in June 2013 of one of the complainants against MSH of offences of fraud for which he received suspended sentences of imprisonment.) 14. The ICO related the guidance in Dransfield to the facts of this appeal and sub- mitted that the DN should be upheld. The GMC adopted a similar approach and reminded the Tribunal that it was not concerned with alleged abuses of power by a public authority. The evidence 15. Dr. Humayun gave evidence briefly, repeating his concerns over alleged dis- crimination and the need to resolve his suspicions as to the way that the GMC handled his referrals and similar issues relating in particular to doctors of Paki- stani origin. He relied on a witness statement prepared for proceedings in an Employment Tribunal by A of HMRPCT. It was quite impossible, however, to understand how it assisted his case. He adduced other documentary evidence. Some was submitted late in breach of the Registrar’s directions. We read eve- rything nevertheless but none of it had any bearing on the issue before us - whether requests 3 - 5 were vexatious. 16. Janet Mauldridge, an information access officer at the GMC, gave evidence on its behalf. She related the history of the requests with which this appeal is con- cerned and of the GMC’s previous dealings with MSH. She stated that, by January, 2014, the GMC Information Access Team had dealt with over one hundred individual questions, often repetitive, overlapping and of no obvious value. She described the burden that such correspondence imposed. She ap- 6pended to her statement a schedule of requests made by MSH since January, 2014, most but not all of which had been refused. She was the author of the let- ter of 18th. July, 2014 to the ICO setting out very clearly the GMC’s case and appending two Annexes. Annex A contained correspondence with MSH begin- ning with the important Couchman letter referred to in paragraph 4 and continu- ing to January, 2014. Annex B contained a sequence of requests from MSH and GMC responses, which are further considered at paragraphs 22 and 23. Our Reasons 17. The Tribunal is aware that the Court of Appeal has, as at the date of this Deci- sion, reserved judgment on an appeal from the UT in Dransfield. However, it will not delay delivery of a decision pending that judgment, the date of which is uncertain but will apply the guidance in the UT decision, which is binding upon it unless or until it is overruled. 18. We are concerned only with the treatment of requests 3 - 5 as vexatious, since that is the only decision contained in the DN. We should add, however, that 1 and 2 were clearly subject access requests which cannot be made pursuant to FOIA (see s.40(1)). We understand that the requested information had been substantially provided over a year earlier. 19. As to requests 3, 4 and 5, we have no doubt that, taken in the context of the history of the previous four years’ correspondence, they constituted a clear abuse of the rights conferred by FOIA s.1 and the GMC was fully entitled to treat them as vexatious. In reaching that emphatic conclusion we take account of both the previous FOIA and DPA requests and the related letters and emails in Annex A. That conforms to the “holistic” approach advocated in Dransfield. 720. The long sequence of emails, requests and complaints stems from MSH’s re- fusal or inability to accept that his complaint as to the handling of his case had been fully and independently investigated by external solicitors and that, what- ever his disappointment, the matter could be taken no further, unless he thought that he could challenge their conclusions by way of judicial review. A time comes when further banging on the same door will not bring anyone to open it. Mere repetition of the same points through an endless list of questions will achieve nothing but merely impose a heavy burden on those called upon to answer them. The burden is not just the time and energy required to satisfy an unceasing stream of inquiries but the knowledge that no answer, however de- finitive, will ever halt or even slow it down. 21. So it is necessary to consider not just the volume but the futility of the requests made from 2009 onwards. Furthermore, the Tribunal has to ask itself whether MSH was really interested in the answers or simply asking questions to keep the GMC occupied. It is noteworthy that he was told at an early stage of the cor- respondence that the GMC did not keep records of the race (as distinct from ethnicity) or the religious affiliations of doctors referred; yet he continued to re- quest percentages for Muslim doctors as though quite blind to the GMC re- sponse. 22. We were assisted in our assessment by the provision in Annex B to the GMC’s letter to the ICO of 18th. July 2014, of the exchanges of letters relating to the nineteen requests made by MSH under FOIA and/ or the DPA from April, 2009 to 29th. October, 2013, the immediate predecessor to the requests featured in this appeal. 23. They demonstrate a remorseless repetition, in slightly varying forms, of re- quests that had already been answered or previously identified as requiring in- formation which the GMC did not hold – such as the religion and race of a doc- tor. A single letter of request often contained a long list of wide - ranging and detailed questions often far removed from MSH’s case or any issue of obvious 8public interest. They include inquiries, covering wholly unrelated appeals over a ten - year period, as to - - how expert witness statements were prepared, - the method of selection of expert witnesses; - ages of doctors referred; - how many Jewish doctors were referred; 24. The disproportionate burden on the GMC of this barrage of inquiries would be plain to anyone of MSH’s obvious intelligence and sophistication. The Tribunal concludes that it was in part an expression of anger and disappointment and was designed to harass an authority, which MSH regarded, without a shred of justification on the evidence of this appeal, as unreasonably hostile and biased against him. He evidently took the same view of HMRPCT. 25. The impression made by MSH on the Tribunal, whether testifying or arguing his case, tended to reinforce rather than weaken the sense that he was engaged in a feud rather than legitimately seeking information. Conclusion 26. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 27. Our decision is unanimous. David Farrer Q.C. Tribunal Judge 19th. February, 2015 9"

[2] The impugned decision under appeal is the Decision Notice (“DN”) from the Respondent dated the 14 April 2014: Reference FS50526132.3 Background to the Appeal: [3] The relevant background to this appeal is set out in the confidential annex to the DN and has been disclosed to the Appellant and is adopted for the purposes of this appeal. Essen- tially the Appellant made complaints to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (“PHSO”), the Public Authority in question, about the service received from PHSO including how staffs have dealt with her concerns when dealing with her complaint about the Respon- dent herein. The issues that arise in this appeal include requests made by the Appellant where she claimed that she experienced difficulties in identifying where she should direct her complaint and about the way her case had been dealt with and the member of staff con- cerned. The nature an extent of the requests are set out fully in the DN, the grounds of ap- peal and the Respondents formal response. [4] In response specifically to the Appellants request of 18 November 2013 to PHSO for “telephone extension numbers”, later identified further and clarified by the Appellant to be “telephone numbers of Executive Office Staff” (“the requested information”), PHSO provided a further response on 4 February 2014 stating that the requested information was still ex- empt by virtue of section 14(1) FOIA for the reasons previously provided. It is noted that PHSO did provide a central number for the Executive Office which could be used as a point of contact. The Decision Notice: [5] Section 14(1) FOIA states that a public authority is not obliged to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious. There is no public interest test. The Respondent properly identifies the criteria to be considered in the issue of vexatious requests and refers to the Dransfield decision wherein the Upper Tribunal commented that vexatious could be defined as “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of formal procedure” and further refers to instructive identification examples such as the burden imposed by the re- quest, the motive of the requester, harassment or distress to Public Authority employees while reminding us these were not exhaustive tests. As in any case before these courts and tribunals each case must be decided on its’ merits. Proportionality and justification are im- portant aspects also and again in Dransfield the Upper Tribunal helpfully identifies the impor- tance of adopting a holistic and broad approach to the determination of whether a request is vexatious or not. We note and have noted in many of these cases the significance of a pre- vious course of dealings, as there is in the facts of this case. [6] In the DN and his response to the grounds of appeal, the Respondent sets out carefully his reasoning for his Decision and finds that this case crosses the fine line between being an “Obsessive rather than a Persistent” request. This Tribunal heard at length from the Appel- lant at the oral hearing of this appeal and while we agree the request has most of the ingre- dients of a vexatious request and borders on the obsessive, we are satisfied having heard the Appellant and considered all the evidence that the request while certainly persistent, falls short of being obsessive and in all the circumstances we do not find the request vexatious. Reasons: [7] We do not accept that it was designed to cause disruption and annoyance to staff at the PHSO and while we accept it may well have done so we are convinced beyond doubt about the bona fide design behind the request which arose out of frustration pursuant to her deal- ings with the PHSO in getting answers to important and genuine issues she required assis- tance with.3 [8] Again we do not accept that the Appellant used her request as a means to vent anger at any particular decision or to harass and annoy the public authority. We have considered carefully her response to this suggestion in her Grounds of Appeal and her detailed evi- dence before us and are satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for her request and there was reason to be dissatisfied with the service she was being given by the public au- thority. [9] Having considered the evidence and on hearing the Appellant on what were clearly her genuine concerns we find that the backdrop of other correspondence and complaints only exacerbated her grounds for concern and the frustration she felt in all the circumstances of this case. The Appellant clearly was not getting satisfaction nor the meaningful response she deserved. This Tribunal reminds itself that there is duty on Public Authorities to assist mem- bers of the public in formulating and processing their requests. On hearing the Appellant on the facts in this case we are of the view that more could have been done to assist the proc- essing of this request. That this was a request with a genuine purpose was acknowledged by the Respondent but this Tribunal add that the Appellant has satisfied us that the need for her persistence, in its various forms as it transpired on the facts, is justified by the failure of the public authority to respond more comprehensively, effectively, efficiently or adequately. This is despite the assertion that the value of this particular request may be or even might be regarded as limited. We have no doubt (and it seems to be common case) that the motive for the Appellants’ request is to genuinely seek information that would enable her to contact the relevant person in order to challenge the review team decisions as they were not an- swering complaints. That is what this case is all about. This failure to properly or adequately respond to this request led to confusion and frustration and a break down in communications such that the Appellant did not seek or deserve. We are of the view that it is wrong to sug- gest that she deliberately sought to or set out to harass or distress the public authorities’ staff and on hearing the Appellant at length we find on balance this case has not been es- tablished. We note the Respondent also accepts to a degree these findings of fact but de- cided that the effect of the request was such as to cause harassment or distress. We do not accept this as proven on balance on the papers and have heard no evidence in support of these assertions. Further if there were any perceived harassment or such distress then the burden for such, in our considered view, cannot be placed solely on the Appellant or her re- quest. [10] We note the Ombudsman's decision dated 28 February 2014 and have heard the Appel- lant on the background and give it significantly more weight that the Respondent seems to have given it. [11] We have heard the Appellant give the details of the history of the background of com- plaints and inquiries referred to in the Response from the Respondent herein. We are satis- fied that a more constructive and helpful response form the public authority would have averted the resulting persistence that evolved through the frustration caused to the Appellant by a failure to provide appropriate assistance and answers in an unnecessarily long and drawn out process of dealing with the Appellant. The evidence of impact of any burden on the authority is not, in our view, a burden that can or should be placed solely on the Appel- lant on the facts in this case. As can be seen from our deliberations above, this was an un- fortunate case of poor communication that led to persistent conduct by the Appellant which bordered on oppressive but did not in our view on a holistic and broad view of the facts of this particular case become either oppressive or vexatious. [12] Accordingly we allow the appeal and reverse the finding of the DN under appeal. Brian Kennedy QC 19 January 2015."
"1361","EIR","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER Information Rights Tribunal Reference: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Respondent: The Information Commissioner Judge: NJ Warren Member: D Sivers Member: A Chafer Hearing Date: 9 September 2014 Decision Date: 1 December 2014 DECISION NOTICE 1. This appeal fails. 2. Ms Cornillon is a tenant on a council estate in Lambeth that is being completely redeveloped under a PFI contract. On 20 May 2012 she asked the London Borough of Lambeth (“Lambeth”) for:- “ all the information I am entitled to about the Myatts Field North Estate PFI contract signed around May 4”. Lambeth sent her a redacted version of the contract which runs to nearly 300 pages with another 742 pages of schedules. The information was supplied on a memory stick. 3. Lambeth originally dealt with the request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) but it is not now in dispute that the appropriate regime for us to consider is the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR). The remaining disputed information consists of the redacted material. The relevant exception under EIR is Regulation 12(5)(e). This raises the question of whether disclosure of the disputedDecision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Date of decision: 1 December 2014 information would adversely affect “the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest”. The exception applies only if, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining it outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. There is a presumption in favour of disclosure. 4. Ms Cornillon accepts (see paragraph 37 of her final statement) that there may be grounds for non-disclosure of very specific information, such as budgets where the information, if released, would give a contractor a competitive advantage over the PFI consortium in a tendering process for some sub-contracted work within the contract. However, she contested the extent of the redactions made by Lambeth by complaining to the Information Commissioner (ICO). 5. In the course of his investigation the ICO:- (a) asked Lambeth to prepare a schedule of redactions and sent a copy of it to Ms Cornillon; (b) asked Lambeth for a detailed explanation of the redactions; (c) checked that the commercial companies involved agreed that the exception might apply; (d) asked for and received from Lambeth three boxes of documents in order to compare the redacted and un-redacted versions. In a decision notice dated 2 September 2013, the ICO accepted that Lambeth had applied the exception properly. He added that as the commercial sensitivity of the information faded he would expect Lambeth to provide tax payers with a clear overview of the financial commitments by which they would be bound for the next 25 years. 6. (The ICO also dealt with some redactions of personal data which are not relevant to this appeal). 2Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Date of decision: 1 December 2014 7. Ms Cornillon appealed against the decision notice to the Tribunal. 8. In the course of our work on this appeal we have considered a mountain of material. The “core bundle” amounts to 872 pages and comes in two volumes. The requested information runs to about 2,000 pages with about 285 redactions. There are also final submissions from the parties. That from the ICO runs to six pages; the one from Ms Cornillon has 34 pages. We propose to explain our decision in three ways. 9. First, we agree with and adopt the ICO’s reasoning in his decision notice. 10. Second, we wish to give a “big picture” finding about our overall conclusion. 11. Ms Cornillon’s blunt big picture submission, taken from paragraph 5.3 of her final statement is that:- “ … . The handling of the original request, the original internal review and the subsequent appeals had been characterised by a combination of obstructiveness and incompetence, an unfair bias in favour of the local authority which has resulted in significant and unnecessary delay and an enormous waste of my time.” 12. We reject that submission. No one reading the correspondence between the ICO and Lambeth could fail to be impressed by:- (a) the concern of the ICO to investigate properly; (b) the immense amount of work put in by Lambeth to create a schedule justifying in detail all the redactions. 13. The burden on staff at Lambeth must have been heavy but they have clearly taken very seriously their obligation to be transparent in connection with this sensitive development; they have not tried to take refuge, as they might have done, in claims that the scale of the redactions needed made the request “manifestly unreasonable”. 14. Having ourselves spent many hours reading through the documents we are satisfied, as was the ICO, that Lambeth has complied correctly with its obligations under EIR. Of 3Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Date of decision: 1 December 2014 course, with a request for information of this size, there will always be scope for human error. We cannot say even now that every error has been eradicated. In a task of this size certainty is impossible to achieve. 15. We are also satisfied that Lambeth have done all that could reasonably be expected of them under Regulation 9(1) which contains the duty to provide advice and assistance to Ms Cornillon. It is a paradox that one of Ms Cornillon’s complaints is the huge amount of material which has been disclosed, even though (see page 201) she declined an approach from the ICO to narrow her request. It is simply not possible for a public authority to give in respect of a request such as this, the sort of detailed advice and assistance which it might be able to provide for someone asking for a smaller specific piece of information. In particular, we do not accept that it was reasonable to expect Lambeth to go further than they did in providing secretarial support, indexing, or early explanations of each redaction. 16. Third, we turn to deal specifically with some of the points raised by Ms Cornillon in her final statement. In the rest of this decision paragraph numbers refer to the paragraphs in that statement. 17. We do not accept the assertion (paragraph 5.2) that schedule 4 of the project agreement contains nothing commercially sensitive. We are unclear as to how it came to be disclosed when it did. Perhaps the view was taken that over time the information contained in it was less sensitive. It may have been a simple oversight or copying error. Either way its disclosure is now academic as far as this Tribunal is concerned because the document is published on Lambeth’s website. 18. We do not accept the assertion (paragraph 5.1) that the open bundle demonstrates that there are more parts of the PFI contract that have not been disclosed to Ms Cornillon. There are bound to be difficulties if you ask for, as Ms Cornillon did, “all the information I am entitled to about” a particular contract. The interpretation now placed upon her request by Ms Cornillon to include, for example, invoices, work sheets and “corporate information about different companies involved” makes the request unworkable. In our judgment the interpretation placed upon the request by Lambeth 4Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Date of decision: 1 December 2014 and the ICO is a reasonable one and it would be unreasonable to order Lambeth to take further steps. 19. Paragraph 10 refers to a letter Ms Cornillon wrote to the ICO dated 7 May 2013 complaining about repetition, the use of stock phrases, inaccuracies, inconsistencies and a lack of cross-referencing. In one part of her letter Ms Cornillon even complains about Lambeth mistakenly failing to redact when they should have done so. Requests for information on this scale usually do impose heavy burdens of redaction on public authorities. Inevitably errors will creep in and we do not consider that the ICO erred by not exploring these further. At paragraph 17, Ms Cornillon says that she expected the commissioner to obtain:- “ … a genuinely meaningful and nontechnical justification and explanation of each redaction without necessarily disclosing the actual information deemed confidential.” Presumably Ms Cornillon also expects this to be achieved without the use of “explanatory stock phrases.” Her demands, in our judgment, are impossible to meet and are therefore unreasonable. 20. At paragraphs 27-36 Ms Cornillon discusses the extent of the redactions and complains of errors. 21. Taking a proportionate approach we have considered a sample of the redactions in the closed material with which we were provided to check that they were proper. It was true that some of the redactions originally proposed in the schedule dated 8 March 2013 appeared to us to be questionable. In respect of each one of these, however, we found that at some stage disclosure of that information had taken place. In no case, on checking the closed bundle, did we find an item which seemed to us to have been improperly redacted. The reason for later disclosure may have been error; change in circumstances; or a change of mind. Whichever it might be the issues are now academic and we were satisfied from the work we did that the scope of the redactions was proper. 5Decision Notice Continued Tribunal Reference Number: EA/2013/0222 Appellant: Jeanne Cornillon Date of decision: 1 December 2014 22. At paragraph 40 Ms Cornillon challenges the ICO reference to future PFI housing schemes asserting that there will not be any. Even if this is true, there will still no doubt be large building projects of some kind in respect of which there will be similar tenders. 23. At paragraphs 48-50 Ms Cornillon makes several criticisms of the redactions. We have already explained our own testing of the redactions. It seems to us that these criticisms overlook the “jigsaw” or “mosaic” effects (see page 126) of how a skilled competitor might interpret incomplete information. 24. Ms Cornillon also points to the fact that some of the private flats for sale are now complete and advertised for sale. We do not accept the assertion that it is therefore open to anyone to obtain the disputed information, or part of it, by calculation. Prices change over time. Moreover the ICO and Lambeth have both accepted that further disclosure can and should be made as time goes by. The ICO decision notice and this appeal have focused on what disclosure should have been made by Lambeth at about the time they completed their review. 25. Ms Cornillon also makes submissions about the conduct of the public interest test. She is very concerned about what she regards as underperformance of the PFI contract. However, the events to which she refers took place long afterwards. Release of the disputed information would not have helped mend a roof, fix a boiler or correct breaches of health and safety legislation. That work can be done without it. Nor do we accept that release of the disputed information would hold the contractors to account for failings. If a roof leaks or a boiler does not provide hot water, pointing to figures in a schedule will not improve the argument. 26. For these reasons our decision is that the ICO decision is correct.

"1371","EIR","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER (INFORMATION RIGHTS) ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50530729 Dated: 29 May 2014 Appellant: Colin Parker Respondent: The Information Commissioner Heard on the papers: Manchester Date of Hearing: 24 October 2014 Before Chris Hughes Judge and Malcolm Clarke and Dave Sivers Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 26 October 2014 Date of Promulgation: 27 October 2014Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 Subject matter: Freedom of Information Act 2000 2Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1. On 1 October 2013 the Appellant in these proceedings, Mr Parker, wrote to the Office for Judicial Complaints (now the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office “JCIO” – an office of the Ministry of Justice “MOJ”) making a request under FOIA for:- “… information on the number of complaints arising from small claims made in the County Court and made to the Office for Judicial Complaints over the last two years and its statistical and financial analyses.” 2. The public authority requested clarification of the meaning of the request to try to understand the ambit of the request. Mr Parker replied:- “The scope of my request is small claims in the County Court, the complaints to you arising therefrom, and the resulting analyses of these. I intended that my request would include contextualisation and clarification of complaints where the judge’s personal misconduct led to successful appeals” 3. In the light of his reply the JCIO replied on 18 November 2013 explaining why it would not be supplying the information. The letter incorrectly informed Mr Parker that “the Office does not have a publication scheme”. The letter explained that there were in excess of 3800 complaints made during the relevant period and in order to extract the information each file would need to be examined individually to extract the information requested. An estimated time to examine each file of 10 minutes resulted in a cost to the MOJ well in excess of the £600 level at which the Ministry was entitled to refuse to supply information on the grounds of excessive costs. The MOJ stated: “.. we cannot even suggest you file a refined request as even reducing the time period to 1 year would not bring the figure within the cost limit.” The position was maintained on review. 4. Mr Parker complained to the Respondent in these proceedings, the Information Commissioner (“ICO”). The scope of the investigation which the 3Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 ICO carried out was how the MOJ had handled the request in terms of its reliance on the costs of compliance and how it had assisted Mr Parker. 5. During the course of the investigation the MOJ provided further information including that the records of complaints were held in paper files of varying length which would require individual searches to establish the information which Mr Parker had requested. It explained set out how it had attempted to assist Mr Parker and the limitations of what was possible in refining the field for searching while still extracting the information which Mr Parker sought. On 29 May the ICO issued his report. He found that the MOJ was entitled to rely on S12(1) (“exemption where cost of compliance exceeds appropriate limit”) and that it had provided appropriate advice and assistance to Mr Parker. 6. Mr Parker appealed to this Tribunal on 12 June. His appeal document is ten pages long and somewhat discursive; it is critical of both the ICO and the MOJ. He asserted that the ICO failed to deal with the absence of a publication scheme, that there was inadequate evidence of the costs of providing the information, inadequate evidence of support and advice. He provided a calculation which he considered demonstrated that the costs limit would not be reached. He complained that the decision notice did not deal with a letter he had subsequently written to the JCIO. 7. In his reply the ICO maintained the position set out in the decision notice. He confirmed that the MOJ had a publication scheme but that since the information requested was not published it would not have helped Mr Parker with his request and was not a matter within the Tribunal jurisdiction. The questions for the Tribunal 8. The ICO made his decision on the application of s12 and s16 to the handling of the request by the JCIO of the MOJ. Mr Parker has disputed his conclusions and asserted that there was inadequate evidence for the ICO to reach those conclusions. He asserts that the duty to provide assistance was ignored by the JCIO and that the cost limit would not be breached. 9. S16(1) provides:- 4Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 “It shall be the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to it.” 10. In handling the request the JCIO first attempted to clarify the request so that it could answer the question. Having done that it then explained the cost issue and the scale of the information held. It continued (letter 18/11/2013 bundle page 29/30):- “If following an investigation, a complaint regarding a judicial office holder was upheld, it would be very rare if this justified an appeal being lodged. Even if it were, this Office would not be made aware of any appeal being made or such outcome. ….. Unfortunately we cannot even suggest you file a refined request as even reducing the time period to 1 year would not bring the figure within the cost limit.” 11. The Tribunal is satisfied that this response was appropriate and provided appropriate assistance to Mr Parker which would enable him to better understand the nature of the information held and the difficulties in obtaining the information he wanted. The Tribunal is satisfied that the JCIO provided the assistance which it was reasonable for it to provide under s16(1); he was given the costs information which he could have used to recast his request into one which could be met within the costs limit. 12. The second issue is whether the costs limit would be reached by the request. In his appeal (bundle page 17, paragraph 9) he argued:- “… A one year time scale would cost approximately 2000 complaints X 10 mins which is three hundred and fifty pounds.” 13. If this calculation was accurate then this would be a significant blow against the position of the JCIO and ICO. However it is not. 10 minutes for each complaint and 2000 complaints, gives a time commitment of 20,000 minutes which is 333 hours – not three hundred and fifty pounds. However the cost of each hour of staff time is £25. This gives a total cost of £8,333 for Mr Parker’s 5Appeal No: EA/2014/0145 request reduced to one year (using Mr Parker’s figure of slightly more than half the number of complaints recorded over a two year period).. 14. The costs are far higher than the limit specified in s12. The evidence is that the time to search each paper file for this information would be significant – an estimate of 10 minutes is a reasonable estimate. The Tribunal is satisfied that the estimate provided by the MOJ is robust. Conclusion and remedy 15. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the ICO’s decision notice is correct in law and the appeal must fail. 16. Our decision is unanimous Judge Hughes [Signed on original] Date: 26 October 2014 6"

On 12 February 2013 the Appellant in this case (Oldham Borough Council-""Oldham"") received a request for information from the second respondent (Foxdenton and District Protection Group “Foxdenton”) in the following terms:- “…full disclosure of correspondence and e-mails relating to the 110 acres of farms and attendant grazing land. This is to include HOW planning company, the three farm owners, Aldi supermarket company, and any other developers” 2. On the 11 March 2013 Oldham responded declining to provide the information and claiming the protection of section 43 FOIA-prejudice to commercial interests. Oldham subsequently reviewed the matter and concluded that the request properly fell within EIR and continued to argue that the information was protected from disclosure. 3. On 2 May 2013 Foxdenton contacted the First Respondent (the Information Commissioner-""the Commissioner""). The Commissioner investigated the matter, during the course of which Oldham disclosed certain information to Foxdenton. 4. On 25 September 2013 the Commissioner issued his decision and directed the disclosure of four categories of documents and a correspondence bundle which he listed in the decision notice. Oldham appealed against this decision on 22 October 2013 in respect of three of four categories of documents, these were:- • The Guest Garsden Heads of Terms, • The Mouchel Technical Note, • The e-mail correspondence. 5. Foxdenton were joined as a Respondent in this action, they have supported the stance of the Commissioner and not introduced new arguments or evidence beyond those advanced by the Commissioner. The Scope of the Issues before the Tribunal 6. It is agreed between the parties that EIR is the appropriate statutory framework for the consideration of this request for information. The issues raised by the three disputed documents are distinct and need to be considered separately. The Guest Garden Heads of Terms 7. Regulation 12 of EIR provides protection against disclosure on certain grounds and subject to consideration of the public interest and a presumption in favour of disclosure. The ground relevant to this document is set out at Regulation 12(5):- For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect…. 3(e) The confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest. 8. The parties agreed that this breaks down into four questions that need to be considered: Is the information commercial or industrial in nature? Is the information subject to confidentiality provided by law? Is the confidentiality provided to protect a legitimate economic interest? Would the confidentiality be adversely affected by disclosure? 9. It is agreed between the parties that the first two conditions are met. The Commissioner interprets the third question and fourth question as closely linked. He interprets the third question as needing to be answered in the affirmative and only so answered if there would be harm from the disclosure. 10. It seemed to the Tribunal that the issue of interpretation is more appropriately addressed by considering the actual structure of the legislation which provides three distinct steps in interpretation. 11. Sub-paragraph (e) provides a framework for considering the information itself. In this case the issue is straightforward; heads of agreement are a common part of a commercial negotiation; such negotiations are conducted in confidence; the law protects that confidence. The purpose of the confidence is to help parties conduct their business – undoubtedly in doing so is enabling parties to protect their economic interest – a perfectly normal and legitimate part of the usual commercial process. In a case such as this, with a public authority and another entity in discussions around a proposed or actual commercial relationship it seems most unlikely that the condition of paragraph (e) will not be met. 12. Having established that the paragraph (e) condition is met; the next question to be considered is whether the disclosure would adversely affect “the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information”. It must be noted that the harm envisaged is not to any economic interest in the sense that a public authority or parties with whom it has commercial dealings will be harmed financially by the disclosure, rather it is a different form of harm the harm to confidentiality itself which is at issue. The effect of (5)(e) is to allow a public authority to refuse to disclose commercial information because it is held in confidence and the protection of confidence is a public good which EIR recognises. The information is protected so long as it is not trivial or already in the public domain. From a consideration of the information within the document it is clear that the information contained has some substance. 13. The third step now must be considered. Having established that the information has the characteristics set out in (e) and the public authority can legitimately refuse to disclose the information “to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect” this protected characteristic (i.e. confidentiality) and therefore the condition precedent for 4non-disclosure laid out in 12(1)(a) is met; whether the public authority is able to withhold the information depends on 12(1)(b):- “in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information” 14. This balancing exercise is subject to 12(2); the obligation on the public authority to apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. A presumption in favour of disclosure is simply that - a presumption. The primary issue is where the balance of public interest lies, if there is uncertainty as to how the balance falls then the presumption applies; however on a proper evaluation of the evidence if it is clear that the balance falls one way or the other then the presumption has no purchase on the issue. 15. The question of where the public interest falls is dependent on the facts of the individual case. 16. In this case there is significant public interest in a major development proposal for a large area of land within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. There has been media interest and a community group concerned with the impact of possible developments has been formed and sought information. There is inherent in any disclosure framework a public good in making information available, supporting a better informed public discourse on questions affecting the choices made by public or private bodies which affect the public domain. There is a value in transparency, there is a value in revealing the workings of public bodies and demonstrating how they work to enhance public confidence in those authorities or (in extreme cases) revealing substantial shortcomings. 17. In favour of non-disclosure in such a case there is first of all the harm done to the principal of confidentiality which is recognised by EIR as a good worthy of protection. Then there are the actual risks of harm to the commercial interests which would be protected by confidentiality. In seeking to elicit the actual harm or risk of harm that would flow to these interests from disclosure the Commissioner wrote to Oldham BC on 28 August 2013 :- “Much of the Council's reasoning for withholding the information focuses on what I understand to be ongoing current negotiations or future negotiations (post planning approval) between the developer and the landowners. However, the Council's application for pinch point funding appears to suggest… that land acquisition has been completed. Land acquisition is also not identified as being the risk which would potentially delay the development…. I would be grateful if you could provide clarification on this point."" 18. In a subsequent communication the Commissioner focused on withheld information in the e-mail correspondence and Oldham replied dealing with issues which seemed to largely focus on questions in that correspondence. However the Commissioner legitimately points out in his response to the appeal (bundle page 45 paragraphs 31 - 33):- 5“… The Council, the during the Commissioner's investigation failed to specifically set out how disclosure of the heads of terms would cause harm to the legitimate interest of Foxdenton LLP. Secondly, the Council has failed to set out in its grounds of appeal specifically how Foxdenton LLP’s legitimate economic interest would be damaged if the heads of term were disclosed or indeed how such disclosure would disrupt any negotiations for the purchase of land save a general comment to this effect. In the absence of such arguments, the Commissioner would submit that he did not err in failing to to conclude in his decision notice that disclosure of the heads of terms would cause such harm to Foxdenton LLP. The Council further argues that it is legitimate economic interest in reaching the most advantageous agreement that it could for the development of the site would be damaged if the heads of terms were disclosed since such disclosure would undermine the Council's negotiating position in the event that Foxdenton LLP withdrew and it became necessary for the Council to deal with another commercial partner. The Commissioner, having considered the heads of terms, would submit that the argument is set out by the Council in its grounds of appeal are still vague and speculative and further do not explain what specific prejudice disclosure would cause to the Council's commercial interests. The Commissioner accepted in his decision notice that disclosure of this information would provide parties with an insight into the Council's practices in facilitating such developments, however, the Council has still yet to explain how this knowledge would impact on the Council's commercial interests.” 19. From a perusal of the heads of terms the Tribunal agrees with the Commissioner that it is difficult to see any substantial risk of harm flowing from disclosure of the heads of terms. This document attempts to provide a structure within which the Council and the developer will work together. It envisages the production of a contractual joint venture agreement and sets out a framework within which the two parties will move forward together. It envisages the very large number of areas in which cooperation and agreement will need to be reached and sets out a framework for the governance of the process. Its disclosure should provide some insight to the public in how such developments are carried forward and some the assurance to the public that Oldham are moving forward in a thoughtful and careful way. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that in concluding that the disclosure of this information is not prevented by a consideration of the balance of public interest under regulation 12 the Commissioner came to the correct conclusion. The Mouchel Technical Note 20. In appealing against the Commissioner's decision that this be disclosed Oldham relied on the exception to disclosure provided by paragraph 12(4):- “For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that- … 6(d) of the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data;” 21. The document in question is a study undertaken by a contractor as “a preliminary traffic study relating to an area of land known as the Foxdenton Development Area”. It considers the site and questions as to access to the site in terms of potential traffic issues related to possible developments. In its conclusions it recommends further studies of various aspects. As a simple question of fact and construction it is a finalised report; it is not in the course of completion nor is it an unfinished document and the request is not for incomplete data. The exceptions which Oldham seek to rely on at this point simply do not apply. While Oldham claim that there were ""numerous references in the document to the unfinished and preliminary nature of the assessment that it contained"" it is the assessment which is incomplete and not the document and any planning or transport study of necessity cannot be a complete and explicit statement of every relevant issue. That the document identifies further areas for consideration does not make it incomplete. This has clearly been submitted by a consultant to the Council as a finished document and that is sufficient. 22. Oldham have further sought to protect it from disclosure by relying on regulation 12(5)(e). However, here again there is a profound lack of specificity to the argument and it is difficult to see any basis upon which harm would result from disclosure of what is, after all, a scoping study for work which might be usefully submitted as part of the evidence at a planning enquiry. The Tribunal is satisfied that there are no grounds for the nondisclosure of this report and that therefore the Commissioner correctly ordered its disclosure. The e-mail correspondence 23. In respect of this bundle of some 106 pages, Oldham has argued that Regulation 12(5)(e) is engaged. The bundle consists of a large number of documents – some of which (pages 101-106) are not in scope since they do not relate to the land in question. There is no specificity in the appeal as to how prejudice to the public interest would arise from the disclosure. In Oldham’s response to the Commissioner’s request for further information as to how harm would flow from disclosure (pages 100-101) Oldham listed a series of issues at a significant degree of generality. The Tribunal concurs with the Commissioner’s reasoning and the argument in his Reply (bundle page 50 paragraphs 53 and 54):- “The Council makes the broad statement in its grounds of appeal that the confidentiality was to protect the legitimate economic interests of both the council and a private developer in the successful development. However, the Council has not specifically set out in its grounds of appeal why it believes that this is the case and, furthermore has failed to explain what harm to either the Council or the private developers legitimate economic interests would result from the disclosure of this correspondence. In the absence of such arguments, the Commissioner would maintain that he was correct to conclude in his decision notice that confidentiality in relation to the e-mail correspondence was not provided in order to protect a legitimate economic interest. As such, the Commissioner would submit that he was correct to conclude that the exception under regulation 12(5)(e) is not engaged”. 7Conclusion 24. The Tribunal is satisfied that Oldham has not established its grounds of appeal with respect to the e-mail bundle and therefore the appeal in respect of this set of documents must also be dismissed. 25. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied for the reasons stated that the Commissioner’s decision notice is correct in law, this appeal is without merit and is dismissed. 26 Our decision is unanimous.

Judge and Paul Taylor and Jean Nelson Tribunal Members Date of Decision: 4th April 2014 The appeal was determined on the papers. 1Subject matter: FOIA s.40(5) Whether confirmation or denial by the public authority pursuant to s.1(1) would breach a data protection principle. DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal dismisses the appeal. Dated this 4th day of April 2014 David Farrer Q.C. Judge [Signed on original] 2REASONS FOR DECISION 1. Mr. Simons appeals against a Decision Notice of the ICO dated 13th. November 2013 upholding a refusal by the London Borough of Barnet (“LBB”) to confirm or deny that it held information as to the number of complaints made against an individual whose name and address were known to LBB and to Mr. Simons, the requester. 2. Unusually, the background to this appeal needs no further elaboration. The Request 3. On 26th. July, 2013 Mr. Simons made the following request to LBB – “Subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 2000, I request to be informed about the number of complaints that have been made about ( name and address supplied in the request but omitted here) and to be provided with a breakdown of how many different residents those complaints came from.” 4. LBB responded on 1st. August, 2013, refusing to confirm or deny that it held such information. It cited the exemption provided by FOIA s.40(2) and the release from the obligation to confirm or deny that it held the information provided by s.40(5). It confirmed its refusal on 16th. August, 2013, following an internal review. 5. On the same day Mr. Simons complained to the ICO, pointing out that the wording of the request had been designed to obtain answers that contained numbers but no identifying information, thus preventing LBB from “hiding behind the DPA” (the Data Protection Act, 1998). He repeated this point in correspondence. 6. The Decision Notice of 13th. November, 2013 upheld LBB`s refusal to confirm or deny. It confined itself to considering the request for the number of complaints and made no finding as to the “breakdown” of the number of different residents. Nor does the Tribunal. 37. Mr. Simons appealed to the Tribunal. 8. His grounds of appeal reiterated his argument that he requested only numbers, not identities so that no question of data protection could arise. He appeared to suggest that LBB was denying that complaints had been received, which was precisely what LBB was refusing to do. As in his complaint, he accused LBB of hiding behind the DPA. He further invoked the public interest. Our decision 9. So far as material,s.40 (5) of FOIA provides: - (5) The duty to confirm or deny – ---- (b) does not arise in relation to other information (i.e., other than data subject information) if or to the extent that either - (i) the giving to a member of the public of the confirmation or denial that would have to be given to comply with section 1(1)(a) would (apart from this Act) contravene any of the data protection principles. - - - The first data protection principle, quoted here so far as material, is set out in Schedule 1, Part 1 to the DPA – 1 Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular, shall not be processed unless- (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met . . . 410. “Data” are, for present purposes, information recorded either in a computer or in a manual filing system (DPA s.1(1)). “Personal data” are defined in DPA s.1(1) as – “ . . data which relate to a living individual who can be identified – (a) from those data; or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of the data controller;” 11. Mr. Simons` case evidently rests on the argument that a reply to his request giving simply the numbers of complaints and complainants could not amount to the processing of personal data because the numbers which he expressly requested are not personal data. That is plainly wrong. 12. As to (a), the data subject cannot, of course, be identified from such data alone. However, the data controller, for the purposes of (b), was LBB which certainly possessed other data, namely his/her name and address, which permitted identification of the data subject. Identification of the individual in the Request inevitably provides the data controller with data satisfying (b), if it did not possess them already. 13. That, of itself, disposes of this argument but it is fair to add, as a practical consideration, that Mr. Simons also possessed such data so that disclosure of the numbers by LBB would expose the data subject to publication of the volume of complaints, if there were complaints, made against him/her, coupled with identification by anybody to whom Mr. Simons chose to reveal his/her name. 14. If the definition in DPA s.1(1) did not have the effect stated in paragraph 12, the first data protection principle and FOIA s.40(2) and (5) would be dead letters in a case such as this. The protection afforded to a data subject could be 5circumvented by a simple request to omit his/her name and address when providing other, perhaps highly sensitive, personal information relating to him/her to a requester who knew both already. 15. Mr. Simons has not advanced any other argument against the Decision Notice, save a reference to the public interest. Nevertheless, the Tribunal, like the ICO, will deal briefly with the other matters arising from his request. 16. Since this is a request for personal data of a third party, s.40(5) entitles LBB to refuse to confirm or deny, if either response would breach a data protection principle, usually, as here, the first principle. That raises the question whether a yes or no response would involve the processing of such personal data. Clearly, it would indicate that the data subject either had or had not attracted complaints to LBB, the local authority. In either case that would be a provision, that is a processing, of personal data, favourable or not. To deny that you hold information as to an event, where you must hold such information, if it occurred, amounts to a denial that it occurred. 17. Would such processing be fair? No local resident would reasonably expect the local authority to publish the information that he/she is or is not the subject of complaints from neighbours and, if complained of, by how many. Fairness could in some rare circumstances require that such information be circulated, for example in a case involving extreme and perhaps dangerous conduct. There is no evidence of that here. Processing in this case would not be fair. 18. We need not, therefore, consider “lawfully” nor the further requirement for satisfaction of a Schedule 2 condition ( though satisfaction appears highly improbable). 619. Save in so far as it is engaged in the concept of fairness, the balancing of public interests does not arise here since the application of s.40(5) does not engage an exemption. The provision is independent of s.40(1) and (2), which provide for an absolute exemption anyway.. 20. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal. 21. Our decision is unanimous. Signed David Farrer Q.C.

"150","EIR","IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL Case No. EA/2013/0239 GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS ON APPEAL FROM: The Information Commissioner’s Decision Notice No: FS50494253 Dated: 10 October 2013 Appellant: Jacqueline Milopoulos Respondent: Information Commissioner Public Authority: Kent County Council Heard at: Field House, London Date of hearing: 10 March 2014 Date of decision: 26 March 2014 Before Angus Hamilton Judge and Dave Sivers and Rosalind TatamAppeal No.: EA/2013/0239 Subject matter: s 41 Freedom of Information Act 2000 Cases considered: Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1968] FSR 415; Webber v IC & Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust GIA/4090/2012 DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL The Tribunal dismisses the appeal for the reasons set out below. -2-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0239 REASONS FOR DECISION Introduction 1 Section 41 (1) of FOIA provides that information is exempt information if: ‘it was obtained by the public authority from any other person (including another public authority), and the disclosure of the information to the public (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person.’ 2 Section 41 provides a qualified exemption and in accordance with s2(2) of FOIA it is also necessary to consider whether: ‘in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.’ The Tribunal has described this as the ‘public interest balancing exercise’. 4 The factual background to this matter is correctly set out in the Commissioner's Decision Notice. In brief the appellant wrote the Kent County Council (the public authority) in relation to, it would appear, her mother's estate indicating that she believed that the public authority was a creditor of her mother's estate. The appellant asked whether the debt was included in the 2011/2012 accounts and, if not if it would be included in the 2012/2013 accounts. The appellant also asked the amount of the debt. 5 The public authority responded stating that the year of the relevant accounts would depend on the year in which the debt had been raised. The public authority declined to state the amount of the debt citing the section 41 exemption. -3-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0239 6 The appellant then complained to the Commissioner. The Commissioner proceeded to consider in his Decision Notice solely whether the council were correct to rely upon the exemption under section 41 in relation to the amount of the debt – the public authority having clarified that the specific amount of the debt would not appear in their accounts for any year. 7 The Commissioner issued a Decision Notice dated 10 October 2013 in relation to this matter in accordance with s. 50 of the Act. The Decision Notice stated that the public authority had correctly relied on section 41 of the Act and as such, required no steps to be taken. The appeal to the Tribunal 8 The appellant submitted an appeal on 4 November 2013. The appellant indicated that she was still seeking answers to all her original questions – i.e. the year of the accounts in which the debt appeared as well as the amount. The Tribunal felt that the appellant’s pursuit of the account year was based on a misunderstanding by her of the detail that would be provided in the public authority’s accounts – although total creditors would be shown individual creditors would not. 9 The Tribunal found some of the appellant’s submissions a little hard to follow. This is of course understandable in relation to a litigant in person who may not have had the benefit of legal advice. The Tribunal did their best to interpret the appellant’s submissions in a manner that was consistent with the legislation. The Tribunal understood that the appeal raised two principal points – first, that the appellant doubted that the information attracted a ‘duty of confidentiality’ because it related to a deceased person and because it was her understanding that the public authority would have to publish the information in due course as part of their open accounting procedures. Ancillary to this first point, the appellant also appeared to suggest that as a close relative (but not a personal representative) of the deceased she was entitled to have the information disclosed to her. -4-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0239 10 Secondly the Tribunal understood the appellant to be contending that the public interest balancing exercise in s2(2) favoured disclosure as it was in the public interest to know what debts were owed to the public authority as it was principally an agency funded from public taxation. The appellant also drew attention to the general public interest in the funding arrangements of residential care home places, and the particular interest of care home residents who pay their own fees and, in the appellant’s contention, may indirectly subsidise those residents whose fees are paid from the public purse. 11 The Tribunal did note that the appellant appeared to be contending that the Commissioner had upheld the public authority’s refusal to disclose the sought information on the basis that it would involve the disclosure of personal data but the Tribunal accepted that neither the Commissioner nor the public authority had contended this and the Tribunal did not therefore consider this as an appeal point. The questions for the Tribunal 12 The Tribunal considered that the questions for them were whether the s.41 exemption had been properly claimed by the public authority in relation to the amount of the debt and whether the public interest balancing test favoured upholding the exemption or disclosure of the information. Evidence 13 All parties have agreed that this matter should be considered ‘on the papers’ only and we have heard no live evidence or oral submissions. No parties or representatives attended the hearing. 14 We have considered, from the Appellant, the Notice and Grounds of Appeal and supporting documents and the appellant’s reply to the -5-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0239 Commissioner’s response to the appeal. We have considered, from the Commissioner, the Decision Notice, the response to appeal and the final submissions. There were no submissions from the public authority and the Tribunal understood that they had not been joined as a party to the proceedings Conclusion 15 The Tribunal fully accepted that the amount of a debt owed by an individual to a public authority was in a category of information clearly covered by the s.41 exemption and attracted the requisite element of confidentiality. This point did not appear to be disputed by the appellant. The Tribunal also felt that it was inarguable that following an individual’s death the information would remain confidential and the duty of confidentiality would be transferred to the personal representative(s) of the deceased’s estate. The Tribunal noted that very strong support for this conclusion came from the case of Webber referred to by the Commissioner at p.33 of the bundle. The Tribunal did not consider that a next of kin would be entitled to the information unless they were an personal representative (or possibly a beneficiary) as they would have no (legal) interest in the financial details of the deceased’s estate. The Tribunal did not reach a conclusion on whether a beneficiary would be entitled to the information as this was not relevant to this particular case. 16 The Tribunal therefore concluded that the s.41 exemption was engaged and was properly relied on by the public authority. 17 In relation to the public interest balancing test – the Tribunal accepted that there was a public interest in the public knowing the total amount owed to a public authority, the number of creditors and the steps being taken by the public authority to recover monies owed. The Tribunal also considered (but did not reach a conclusion) that there might be a public interest in the disclosure of the details of a single very large debt. The Tribunal however -6-Appeal No.: EA/2013/0239 considered that in this particular case the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information outweighed the public interest in the disclosure of this single relatively modest debt and any general public interest in the funding arrangements of residential care home places and where the liability for funding lay. The Tribunal acknowledged that the appellant had a strong private or personal interest in the information but this in itself could not justify a disclosure under the terms of FOIA. 18 Our decision to dismiss this appeal is unanimous.

"1601","EIR","FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL GENERAL REGULATORY CHAMBER INFORMATION RIGHTS Tribunal Reference: EA/2013/0163 Appellant: Glenda Rodriguez-Noza Respondent: The Information Commissioner Judge: NJ Warren DECISION NOTICE 1. On 3 May 2012 the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) received a complaint from Mrs Rodriguez-Noza about the behaviour of six former colleagues in the period 2006-2009. On 9 May 2012 the NMC wrote to Mrs Rodriguez-Noza indicating that they would not be investigating the matter any further. On 21 November 2012 Ms Rodriguez-Noza wrote to the NMC asking for a copy of the comments or responses made by all of the former colleagues named in her complaint. Her request seems to have been prompted by an NMC procedural rule which relates to a later stage in investigations. The NMC considered that release of information or even a statement as to whether information was held, if done under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which amounts to public disclosure, would be a breach of the Data Protection Principles and thus would infringe the former colleagues’ rights to privacy. They therefore refused to confirm or deny whether they held the information. See Section 40(5)(b)(i) FOIA. 2. Mrs Rodriguez-Noza unsuccessfully complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and now appeals to the Tribunal. The ICO has applied for the appeal to be struck out and the Tribunal has received a reply and further observations from Mrs Rodriguez-Noza. 3. I have carefully considered the papers.

Date of Hearing: Thursday 20th December 2012, Court Employment Tribunal, Liverpool Civil and Family Court. DECISION This Tribunal dismisses the appeal and the respondent’s Decision Notice is upheld.Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 REASONS INTRODUCTION 1. This appeal is brought under s. 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The Appellant appeals against Decision Notice (“DN”) number FS50418656 issued by the Respondent on 25 June 2012. The disputed information relates to information concerning the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (“DBIS”) facilitation of banking and insurance services to Huntingdon Life Services (“HLS”). The exemptions at issue are ss. 21 (information reasonably accessible) , 35(1)(b) (ministerial communications) and 43(2) (prejudice to commercial interests) of FOIA. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 2. On 24 April 2011, the Appellant made a request for information to BIS. The request sought information relating to the provision of banking and insurance services provided by BIS to HLS since 2001. The request was set out as follows: 1. For what purpose have banking and insurance services been provided to HLS since 2001. 2. If the banking and insurance services provided to HLS by your department since 2001 were provided free of charge or has a charge been applied? 3. If the banking and insurance services were provided free of charge to HLS, what was the monetary value of the services was; i.e. how much has it cost the taxpayer? How much would the services etc. have cost HLS if a charge had been applied? 4. If the banking services provided to HLS included any loans or grants and if so what was their monetary value? 5. If any pay-outs have been made to HLS under the terms of the insurance services and if so what was their monetary value? 2Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 3. DBIS initially responded to the request on 26 May 2011. It provided some information for part 1 of the request. It confirmed that no grants or loans had been provided to HLS – which provided a response to part 4 of the request. BIS refused to provide any information for parts 2, 3, and 5 of the request, relying on section 43(2) FOIA. 4. The Appellant requested an internal review. DBIS upheld its initial response. The Appellant remained dissatisfied with how DBIS handled her request and complained to the Commissioner. THE COMMISSIONER’S DECISION Scope of the Request 5. The Respondent considered more information fell within the scope of the request than the information initially referred to by DBIS, particularly in respect of part 1 of the request. The matter was referred to DBIS, who made further disclosures of some information and sought to rely on new exemptions for the information falling within the revised scope. The exemptions therefore considered in the DN are ss. 21, 35(1)(a) and 43(2) FOIA. [DN§§8-15] Section 21 FOIA 6. In relation to some information falling within part 1 of the request, DBIS were entitled to rely on section 21 FOIA, as this exemption applies where information is reasonably accessible to the Appellant otherwise than under FOIA. It is an absolute exemption. 7. The Respondent found the Parliamentary Questions relating to the provision of banking and insurance services to HLS was accessible to the Appellant via Hansard. [DN§§17-18] . Section 35(1)(b) FOIA 8. The Respondent determined that section 35(1)(b) FOIA was engaged in respect of two pieces of information contained with documents 2 and 3 as set out in 3Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 Confidential Annex A to the DN. Section 35(1)(b) is a qualified exemption relating to Ministerial communications; which includes any communications between Ministers of the Crown. The reasons the exemption is engaged are set out in Confidential Annex A. [DN§§19-20] . 9. The DN sets out the arguments put forward by both DBIS and the Appellant for the public interest test which were considered before the Respondent determined the balance of the public interest favoured withholding the information. In considering the balance of the public interest test, the Respondent noted the factors in favour of disclosure; general public interest in transparency and accountability, understanding the reasons why the government took the unprecedented step of facilitating banking and insurances services to a private sector organisation. The Respondent did not consider the allegations made by the Appellant concerning deaths caused by reactions to medicines and an unfair advantage over competitors and holding back progress as requiring any weight, due to the lack of any independent evidence to support the allegations. The Respondent further noted the factors in favour of maintaining the exemption; to some extent the information relates to live issues, the policy decision for the banking and insurance services was made some time ago, and therefore preserving the safe space has diminished over time. The main factors in favour of maintaining the exemption, to which significant weight was afforded, are: the overall policy issues are still live; there is a need for a safe space for this policy to be discussed with frankness and candour and for general policy debates on HLS and the life science sector in general. Disclosure of the disputed information would have a detrimental ‘chilling effect’ of these communications in the particular circumstances of this case. There are further factors set out in Confidential Annex B to the DN. [DN§21-31]. Having heard the evidence at this appeal, and considered the closed bundle of materials, this Tribunal is on balance satisfied that the Respondent was correct in the above reasoning and has heard or seen no evidence that would undermine the basis thereof. Section 43(2) FOIA 10. Section 43(2) is engaged where the disclosure of the information would or would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of any person. It is a qualified 4Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 exemption and subject to the public interest test. Under part 1 of the request, information being withheld under this exemption is contained within document 4 as described in confidential annex A. 11. For the reasons set out in confidential annex B, the Respondent accepted that disclosure of the withheld information would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of HLS. [DN§§34-36] Again on balance and after considering all the evidence, his Tribunal agree. 12. In considering the factors for maintaining the exemption and the factors favouring disclosure, the Respondent determined the balance of the public interest was in maintaining the exemption. In reaching this conclusion the Respondent considered the arguments and factors made by the Appellant and DBIS. The factors in favour of disclosing the information are: understanding why public resources have been and are being used to support HLS and the UK life science industry, general public interest in transparency and accountability, and understand why the government has taken unprecedented step to facilitate banking and insurance services to a private business. Factors in favour of maintaining the exemption include: the significant and enduring detrimental impact on HLS’s commercial interest. Discussion of the factors are also set out in confidential annex B. [DN§§37-43]. This Tribunal heard and read the submissions of both parties and on further consideration of the closed bundle we accept that on balance it is in the public interest in this case that this exemption applies to protect HLS’s commercial interest. We are of the view that this information could be useful to competitors and is only in scope because of the unusual circumstances of this case. We are of the view that competitors probably would not have to release such sensitive information. 13. The Respondent also considered the application of s. 43(2) in respect of part 5 of the request. This part of the request sought information about insurance claims and pay-outs. 14. It was accepted that the disclosure of this commercially sensitive information would prejudice HLS future commercial negotiations with customers and 5Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 suppliers, and damage its position in relation to competitors. This information is not public and is not known by competitors. The Respondent further noted that the only reason BIS has this information is due to the circumstances which led BIS to facilitate the provision of insurance services to HLS. Section 43(2) FOIA is engaged. [DN§§44-47]. Having heard the evidence presented by the parties and considered their respective submissions the Tribunal finds no reason to refute this reasoning and accepts it in the circumstances of this case. 15. The Respondent went on to consider the public interest balance for the application of s.43(2) for part 5 of the request. 16. The Respondent noted factors in favour of disclosure which include the general promotion of transparency and accountability. However, BIS confirmed that any insurance payments made to HLS would not have been made from public funds. In the circumstances of the case, the fact there was no public funds involved and that BIS only held the information as a result of the need to facilitate insurance services, there was very little public interest in disclosure. [DN§48, 51]. Having heard the evidence presented by the parties and considered their respective submissions the Tribunal finds no reason to refute this reasoning and accepts it in the circumstances of this case. 17. By contrast, the Respondent gave significant weight for factors in favour of maintaining the exemption. Revealing details of insurance claims would be highly detrimental to HLS’s commercial interest compared with competitors who would not be required to disclose similar information. The fact that any claims would not be paid out of the public purse which would not assist in transparency. That there would be a commercial detriment to HLS as a result of the circumstances that led to the government facilitating provision of insurance services to HLS, which is the reason BIS hold the requested information. [DN§§49,53-54]. This Tribunal accepts this reasoning as sound in the circumstances of this case and has not been persuaded to the contrary by the submissions of the Appellant or her evidence herein. 6Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 18. The Appellant sets out her grounds of appeal over 4 pages. The Respondent considered there 3 Grounds of Appeal advanced to challenge the DN and this Tribunal broadly agrees with this summation. 19. The Appellant disputes the disclosures from DBIS and its responses to the request for information. The Appellant states that none of the letters she has received from DBIS is signed. While it is correct that the correspondence is not signed by any individual, the correspondence has been sent from DBIS and responds to the request for information made to DBIS. There is no evidence to support any contention that the responses the Appellant received are not genuine responses from DBIS. This ground does not in provide any challenge to the reasoning or decision of the Respondent as set out in the DN. This Tribunal has considered carefully all the documentation in this case including the closed bundle of the disputed documents and is satisfied that there is nothing of concern arising from the fact that there is not a personal signature on the documents referred to and we agree that in any event this fact does not impinge on the reasoning of the Respondent herein in relation to this appeal in all the circumstances. 20. The Appellant argues that she has not had the opportunity to “rebut” the explanations put forward by DBIS, and that she has not been provided with the precise practical mechanism of how HLS commercial interests would be likely to be prejudiced. The Respondent did provide the Appellant several opportunities to put any arguments she wished to do so before the DN was finalised. On 31 May 2012, the Respondent offered the Appellant an opportunity for any final submissions she wished to make. The Appellant replied on 6 June 2012, reiterating some points previously made. A large amount of analysis of the DN is contained in confidential annexes does mean the Appellant is not as fully aware of the Respondent’s reasoning for his decision as would be preferred. However, the nature of the withheld information and the submissions concerning that information is of such a nature that much of the detail cannot be referred to in the open DN without disclosing the withheld information. 7Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 21. The Appellant further argues that the Respondent erred in his balance of the public interest test. The grounds of appeal and further submissions provide narrative of various allegations against the government, mainly relating to allegations that HLS is implicit in the death a large number of individuals, there is corruption and the government is perversely artificially sustaining HLS. 22. The Respondent maintains that his analysis of the public interest test is correct for ss. 35(1)(a) and 43(2) FOIA. The Appellant does not specify which section she challenges for the public interest analysis. Each factor considered by the Respondent in the balance of the public interest was stated and an indication of the weight attributed to that factor was given, along with the reasons for such weight. This Tribunal considered carefully the submissions of the Appellant at the hearing, and subsequently, and is not persuaded that there is any matter raised by the Appellant to rebut the Respondents cogent arguments. 23. The Respondent confirmed to the Appellant early on in the investigation (a letter dated 25 October 2011) that it was outside his powers to investigate whether an organisation is implicated in the deaths of any individuals. The investigation is confined to a consideration of the exemptions relied upon by the public authority under FOIA. The discounting of the Appellant’s allegations (at DN§24-26) the Respondent specifically noted the Appellant had not provided any independent evidence supporting the allegations she made concerning HLS [DN§27]. The Appellant did supply some general leaflets and other material relating to animal testing, but nothing specific relating to the factors to be considered for the withheld information. This Tribunal similarly is restricted in the scope of its investigative powers and can only consider the appeal within the limits of FOIA, as we have done. We can give no significant weight to the evidence provided by the Appellant. 24. The Tribunal wishes to express concern that neither the Respondent nor the Tribunal were given the disputed information. This we find highly unusual and it meant we could not ask questions on it at the oral hearing which detracted from that hearing and necessitated reconvening at a later date to consider carefully what should have been provided in a closed bundle. 8Appeal No. EA/2012/0158 25. Having now read carefully the material relating to the disputed information at DBIS the Tribunal agree, with the submission made by DBIS to the Respondent that it is not in scope for the answer to question 1. We consider that the information requested in question 1 was accurately and fully provided to the Appellant by DBIS and was also provided in the answers to the four parliamentary questions to which DBIS provided links. 26. Having considered carefully the disputed information on examination at DBIS, the Tribunal can give comfort to the Appellant and confirm that there is nothing in those documents which in any way casts doubt on the accuracy or comprehensive nature of the information provided by DBIS in response to question 1. 27. Accordingly we must dismiss the appeal. Judge Brian Kennedy QC 8th March 2013. 9"

That Decision Notice found that the ‘Enforcement Investigation Guide’ (the EIG) held by the Appellant was not exempt information under section 22 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), and ordered disclosure of the EIG. 2. The Appellant appealed the Decision Notice. The Appellant set out its arguments as to why it considered some of the information contained within the EIG was exempt from disclosure under other provisions in FOIA. 3. Further dialogue took place between the parties. In respect of some information within the EIG the Appellant no longer sought to rely on any exemptions. As regards other information within the EIG, having reviewed the Appellant’s arguments and having sought and received explanation from the Appellant in certain regards, the Respondent accepts that certain information within the EIG may be redacted from the EIG on the basis that it is exempt information under FOIA, and that the public interest in maintaining the stated exemption outweighs that in its disclosure. Annex B to this Order sets out the extent of the redactions, and the relevant provision of FOIA."

This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“the FOIA”). The appeal is against the decision of the Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) contained in a Decision Notice (“the Decision Notice”) dated 6th October 2011 (reference FS50398972). 2. The Tribunal Judge and lay members sat on the 8th day of May 2012 and decided the appeal on the papers. Factual Background to this Appeal: 3. Full details of the background to this appeal, the Appellant’s request for information made on 8th June 2010, and the Commissioner’s decision are set out in the Decision Notice and not repeated here, other than to state that, in brief, the appeal concerns a request made by the Appellant to the Second Respondent, the Department for Regional Development (Northern Ireland) (“the DRD”). The Appellant’s request consisted of five parts in relation to “Term Contracts for Environmental Maintenance 2008: EMS2 (southern area), EME1 (eastern area), EMW2 (western area)”. 4. The DRD withheld the parts one and two of the request, under section 43(2) of the FOIA. 5. The DRD disclosed part three of the request. 2Appeal No. EA/2011/0258 6. The DRD informed the Appellant that it had previously disclosed the information requested in part four and five of the request, but provided an additional copy. The Tribunal agrees that these are not therefore an issue in this appeal. The Commissioner’s Decision: 7. The Commissioner served a Decision Notice dated 6th October 2011. The Commissioner’s decision was that the DRD should have handled the request under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (“the EIR”) as opposed to the FOIA. The Commissioner came to this decision on grounds that the information could be defined as an administrative measure likely to affect an element of the environment, in this case a maintenance contract to maintain landscape. The Tribunal accepts the reasoning of the Commissioner in this regard. 8. The Commissioner decided that in respect of the information already disclosed in parts three, four and five of the request, that the requested information has been disclosed and that it goes beyond his role to aid complainants in understanding information disclosed to them. The Tribunal accepts this reasoning. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to suggest that other information has been withheld the Tribunal cannot say the Commissioner was wrong to find that information had been disclosed. 9. In withholding parts one and two of the requested information, DRD relied on section 43(2) of the FOIA, which provides an exemption to protect the commercial interest of any person. The Information Commissioner considered that the FOIA is the incorrect access regime, and considered the equivalent exception under the EIR, namely regulation 12(5)(e). This provides that a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest. Again the Tribunal accepts the reasoning of the Commissioner in this regard. 3Appeal No. EA/2011/0258 10. The Commissioner has set out in detail the applicable legislative framework in the Commissioners Response to this Appeal, and same is not repeated here. 11. In summary, the Commissioner set out, that in order for regulation 12(5)(e) of the EIR to apply, it must be demonstrated that: i. The information is commercial or industrial in nature; ii. The information is subject to a duty of confidence provided by law; iii. The confidentiality is required to protect a legitimate economic interest; and iv. The confidentiality required to protect a legitimate economic interest would be adversely affected by disclosure. 12. In addition to the above, the public interest test must be met, namely, the DRD must also demonstrate that the public interest in maintaining this exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 13. In relation to parts one and two of the request, the Commissioner was satisfied that the information is commercial in nature, as it concerns monetary figures clearly associated with individual environmental maintenance contractors on various specific proposed functions. The Commissioner accepted that there would be an expectation of commercial confidence provided in law for such information in a situation where competitors are bidding for the same contract. The Tribunal accepts this reasoning in the circumstances of this appeal. 14. The Commissioner, in the Decision Notice, discusses in detail the balance of arguments for and against disclosure in the public interest. The Commissioner concludes that the withheld information relates to pricing, which is quite specific to each bidder on each activity and differs considerably in price and detail, and that an obligation of confidence is required to protect the economic 4Appeal No. EA/2011/0258 interests of the bidding companies. Again the Tribunal accepts and endorse the reasoning of the Commissioner in the circumstances of this appeal. The Notice of Appeal: 15. The Appellant appealed by way of a notice of appeal dated 26th October 2011. The grounds of appeal are set out at pages 6-8 of the Notice of Appeal. In addition, the Appellant attached a copy of the Decision Notice, letter dated 8th June 2010 and reply dated 21st June 2010. This notice of appeal seems to rely on the following grounds as basis for appeal: (i) The information requested is not environmental information hence the Commissioner erred in considering the matter under the EIR rather than the FOIA; (ii) The DRD did not refer to section 43(2) in its initial refusal notice; (iii) The exemption/exception is not engaged; (iv) The Commissioner erred in his assessment of the public interest test: he should have found that the public interest in maintaining the exemption/exception was outweighed by that in disclosure of the requested information; and (v) The Commissioner did not issue a determination on parts 3-5 of the Appellant’s request. Reasons & Analysis 16. As set out above, the Tribunal is satisfied that regulation 12(5)(e) is engaged and that it is necessary to determine the balance of the public interest test. The appellant argues that the public interest test favours the disclosure inter-alia because of “concern of private interest that there may be in withholding this information, which when revealed, may cause embarrassment, detail corruptive practice or in deed highlight continued incompetence by the individuals and groups involved, and emphasise even further the need for fundamental change.” On the evidence before this Tribunal, there are no 5Appeal No. EA/2011/0258 grounds for establishing any of these concerns. A vague reference to corruption is insufficient, in our view to amount to a persuasive argument supporting the public interest being in favour of disclosure 17. The Tribunal finds that the Commissioner has given adequate details in each case for his decision and in our view is right in coming to the conclusion he has in relation to the public interest test as regards the information in parts one and two of the request as set out in para 14 above. In the absence of any weightier counter arguments in favour of disclosure the balance of the public interest test favours non-disclosure. Conclusion 18. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses this appeal. 19. The Appellant has the right to apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application must be made to the Tribunal in writing within 28 days of this decision. Brian Kennedy QC Tribunal Judge 12th June 2012. 6"
"1841","EIR","EA/2011/0257 IN THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL (INFORMATION RIGHTS) IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL UNDER SECTION 57 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 2000 EA/2011/0257 BETWEEN:- KEVIN CROSS Appellant -and- THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL ON AN APPLICATION TO STRIKE OUT THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 1 This appeal arises from a request first made by Mr. Cross to Havant Borough Council in December, 2009 for disclosure of a building control decision notice, plans and inspection records relating to a loft conversion to his home carried out in 1987. He had also successfully requested documents relating to a linked planning application. 2 The requested information is plainly “environmental information” for the purposes of the EIR. Under Regulation 5(1) of the EIR, a public authority that holds environmental information must make it available on request. Regulation 12(4) (a) provides that it may refuse to disclose information to 1EA/2011/0257 the extent that it does not hold that information when an applicant’s request is received. 3 Havant twice indicated by e mails in January and May, 2010 that it held the requested information but later denied that this was so when Mr. Cross made a second request for it on 20th. October, 2010. Havant was sufficiently concerned by the apparent inaccuracy of those previous indications to undertake in 2011 a six – day search of its microfiche records, though without success. Its stance now is that it received no building regulations application in 1987 but that it must have been dealt with by an independent authorised inspector. If that was so, Havant received only a notification of compliance with building regulations. 4 Mr. Cross inspected documents in January, 2010 at Havant Council offices, which he certainly believed to be those requested. It is therefore not surprising that he was perplexed by Havant’s later denial that it held them. 5 Although marked as building inspection documents, the plans and notice are, I was told, quite similar to those submitted for the corresponding planning application. There may be room for confusion as to which documents Mr. Cross, or indeed the relevant council officer, saw, though, it should be noted, he is convinced that he saw those respecting the building regulations application. 6 Nobody suggests that Havant deliberately destroyed these records between January and November, 2010. There is no evidence as to whether they could have been mislaid or accidentally destroyed. 7 The ICO, whilst finding breaches of the EIR arising from a charge made by Havant and its failure to cite regulation 12(4)(a) in its refusal, concluded that it was at least probable that it did not hold the requested information. 2EA/2011/0257 8 Mr. Cross appealed. His grounds of appeal referred to a series of criticisms of the ICO which, justified or not, did not form part of the Decision which the Tribunal is empowered to consider. They included a complaint that the ICO had failed to deal with further complaints and that the breaches of the particular EIR regulations which the ICO`s ruling had identified were more extensive than detailed in the Decision Notice. 9 They did not initially include his main complaint, that the ICO had wrongly found that Havant did not hold the requested information. However, reference to this point appeared in a later document and it was obvious that this was the fundamental decision which Mr. Cross wished to appeal. 10 In his response dated 24th. November, 2011, the ICO applied to strike out all grounds of appeal - (i) those set out in the original notice in accordance with the Tribunal’s duty under rule 8(2) (a) of the 2009 Rules and (ii) the ground identified in paragraph 9 in the exercise of the Tribunal’s power under rule 8(3) (c) to strike out a ground which has no reasonable prospect of success. 11 As to (i), it was plain that these grounds went beyond the ICO`s decision. Mr. Cross courteously accepted that they must be struck out, following careful discussion as to the function of the Tribunal. 12 He advanced a firm and clear argument, however, as to Havant’s denial that it held the requested information at the date of his second request. He accepted the possibility that it had disappeared since January, 2010 but that alone would not remotely justify striking out this ground. He insisted, entirely sincerely, that he had seen the building regulation documents on his January, 2010 visit. He was confident that the 1987 application was made to Havant directly. 3EA/2011/0257 13 I accept without hesitation Mr. Cross’s sincerity and truthfulness. He was a moderate, fair – minded reporter of what he was sure he had done and seen. 14 However, whatever be the explanation for his conviction as to the documents that he saw and for Havant’s initial response, I am convinced that this appeal is doomed to failure, given the six – day trawl undertaken by Havant, coupled with its obvious willingness to provide this material, if it had it. On a balance of probabilities - indeed, were it appropriate - by a sterner standard of proof, the Tribunal would inevitably decide that Havant did not hold this information in October, 2010. 15 Accordingly, I order that all grounds of appeal be struck out under the provisions of rule 8(2)(a) or 8(3)(c).

Dated this 2nd.day of December, 2009 David Farrer Q.C. Deputy Chairman, Information Tribunal 2Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This appeal raises general and specific questions as to the commercial interest in course material created within a university, the impact on the university of its disclosure and, if the asserted exemptions to disclosure are engaged, the strength of the conflicting public interests, in protecting the financial standing of universities and exposing their teaching materials and standards to general scrutiny. 2. The University of Central Lancashire (“UCLAN”) offers a very wide range of first degree and post – graduate courses, which attract students from within and outside the United Kingdom. Different departments are engaged in a wide spectrum of research. It contracts on commercial terms with such bodies as the NHS and the nuclear industry for the provision of specific skills and knowledge to their staffs. In performing these functions, it operates in highly competitive markets for student recruitment, government funding and unregulated earnings from overseas students and industry. 3. In 2005, UCLAN first offered students a course in Homeopathy leading to a BSc. degree. Only one other UK university offered such a course but a substantial number of non – university institutions awarded diplomas and other qualifications in the subject. Homeopathy is not a regulated occupation. . 4. Whether homeopathy is properly to be regarded as a science or a valid alternative or complement to the practice of conventional medicine is controversial, especially within the scientific and medical communities. It is not the function of the Tribunal to form a collective view on such issues, let alone to express one, since an opinion on them is quite irrelevant to the determination of this appeal. However, the sharp divide between supporters of homeopathy and its opponents, such as Professor Colquhoun illustrates the keen public interest in the debate. In that regard, it is arguable that the disclosure of the particular information requested in this case may 3Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 not properly be equated with that of corresponding information as to courses such as applied mathematics, zoology or law. There may be considerable interest as to whether such courses are well taught at a particular institution yet a general acceptance that they are subjects suitable for the award of a university degree. Much of the evidence and argument deployed on this appeal applied to university degree courses generally. Recognising that certain broad questions of principle are indeed involved, we stress that our decision relates to particular material, the characteristics of which would not necessarily be repeated in every other academic discipline. The request for information 5 The Additional Party, Professor Colquhoun is a distinguished pharmacologist formerly holding the A.J. Clark chair, now research professor at University College London. He is profoundly sceptical as to the value of homeopathy. In an FOIA request dated 24th. July, 2006 he requested “(i) copies of the course material…given to undergraduates on your course code B251 (BSc (Hons) Homeopathic Medicine)…(including) course notes….PowerPoint presentations….list of the textbooks recommended for this course.” 5. (ii) Copies of all the correspondence and committee meetings that led to the validation of this course as appropriate for a BSc.(Hons.) degree”On 21st. August, 2006, UCLAN provided the validation material requested in (ii) as well as reading lists supplied before enrolment to prospective students. It refused the request as regards (i), relying on s.43(2), which is a qualified exemption to which s.1(2)(b) of FOIA applies. 6. On 23rd. August, 2006, Professor Colquhoun requested an internal review. That was duly undertaken. By letter of 4th. October, 2006, UCLAN, through Professor McGhee, confirmed its original decision, citing, as an additional ground of exemption , s.21 of FOIA. 4Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 The complaint to the Information Commissioner 7. Professor Colquhoun complained to the IC on 21st. October, 2006, arguing, as was argued before us, that the financial but not the commercial interests of UCLAN were engaged and that disclosure was in the public interest in any event. In a postscript, he offered to refine his request so as to seek only the course materials for two identified third – year modules so as to reduce the volume of material involved. That concession did not overcome UCLAN `s objection to provision of the information. 8. It is highly regrettable that by 21st. January, 2008, the IC was still at the stage of an introductory letter to UCLAN, making preliminary enquiries prior to the appointment of a caseworker. In the course of subsequent correspondence UCLAN rightly invoked FOIA s.41 to protect case histories expressly provided in confidence. It is accepted on all sides that they are exempt from disclosure. 9. UCLAN further requested the IC to consider all the originally requested material as it thought the more restricted request might not result in a proper understanding of the arguments. The IC decided to make his decision on the basis of the original wider request. Accordingly, UCLAN supplied all the material in September, 2008. We also received that material and, with the agreement of the parties, examined samples of the content after evidence and submissions. Our purpose was merely to gain a general sense of its nature. It was common ground that a detailed review of the considerable mass of text and powerpoint slides was unnecessary. 10. By e mail dated 26th. September, 2008, Mrs. Bostock, UCLAN `s FOIA and Data Protection officer, having consulted with their solicitors, asked Professor McVicar, the Vice – Chancellor of UCLAN, to issue a certificate under s.36(2)(c) of FOIA that disclosure of the requested information would or would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs, namely the administration of UCLAN. The prejudice asserted arose from the number of similar applications for other UCLAN courses that, Dr. Bostock argued, would or would be likely to be triggered by the disclosure requested. She also referred to possible problems with copyright and moral rights. On 29th. September, 2008 Professor McVicar replied by e mail, expressing his agreement. This was treated as his certificate under s.36. He was 5Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 said to be the “qualified person” for the purposes of s.36(5)(o). This additional exemption, which, like s.43(2) is a qualified exemption, was raised by UCLAN in a letter to the IC on the same day. We shall return both to the substance of the opinion and the way it was arrived at later in this Decision. 11. The IC issued a Decision Notice on 30th. March, 2009. He ruled that s.41 was properly invoked by UCLAN in respect of confidential case histories. He found that none of the exemptions relied on, in relation to the rest of the withheld material, namely those in ss.21, 36(2)(c) or 43(2) were shown to apply. He found UCLAN to be in breach of s.17, in that it did not identify all its grounds for refusal in its response to Professor Colquhoun. In this appeal, UCLAN does not challenge the Decision Notice so far as it relates to s.17 nor the exemption under s.21. Therefore, the FOIA provisions material to our task are s.36(2)(c) and s.43(2). Both involve qualified exemptions so that, if either or both is/are engaged, the Tribunal must decide whether UCLAN has shown that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The appeal to the Tribunal 12. UCLAN appealed against the rulings that those provisions were not engaged. If they or either of them were, then it argued that the public interest in disclosing this information was less than the public interest in withholding it . 13. The IC `s stance remained that neither exemption was available on the evidence and that, if that were not correct, the public interest in disclosure should prevail. 14. The parties agreed that, with reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Office of Communications v IC [2009] EWCA Civ 90, we should consider adjourning our decision on this appeal to await the ruling of the Supreme Court only if that decision might, on the facts as we found them, affect the outcome of this appeal. In the event, that decision will not affect the outcome of this appeal and we have proceeded to our decision. 6Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 15. At a relatively late stage Professor Colquhoun was joined as an additional party on his application. He submitted short written submissions, gave oral evidence and cross examined witnesses for UCLAN. He supported the IC `s case and made further submissions reflecting his professional view and his expertise. He strongly advocated unrestricted publication of course materials generally. The questions for the Tribunal 16. They were as follows : As to s.43(2) (i). Does a university have commercial as opposed to merely financial interests ? (ii) If so, how are they to be identified? (iii) Depending on the answers to (i) and (ii), did UCLAN have commercial interests relevant to the request in this case? (iv) Were they or were they likely to be prejudiced by disclosure? (v) If the answers to (iii) and (iv) are yes, did the public interest in July 2006 in maintaining the exemption from the duty to provide such material outweigh the public interest in disclosing it ? As to s.36(2)(c) : (vi) Was the Vice – Chancellor shown to be a “qualified person”, pursuant to s.36(2) and s.36(5)(o)(iii) ? (vii) If he was, was the substance of his opinion that disclosure would or would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs at UCLAN objectively reasonable? (viii) If so, was it reasonably arrived at? 7Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 (ix) If the answers to (vi), (vii) and (viii) are all yes, did the public interest in July 2006 in maintaining the exemption from the duty to provide such material outweigh the public interest in disclosing it? Finally, if we concluded that both exemptions were engaged, but that, separately viewed, in each case, the public interest in withholding the information did not outweigh the interest in disclosure (x) Did the combined strength of the interests in maintaining the exemptions outweigh the public interest in disclosure? Our findings on other issues relieved us of the difficult task of applying the Ofcom ruling to the facts of this case1. Submissions of the Parties as to the law and the facts. 17. Put shortly , UCLAN `s case was as follows : As to s.43(2) : (i) Commercial interests • The interest of a university in its course work is commercial, not merely financial Mr. Pitt Payne urged us to adopt a broad definition of the term as was done in the Student Loans case. • UCLAN, like the great majority of universities, operates in a global market in which it competes vigorously for students. Its funding from The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) depends on meeting recruitment targets. The investment of time and money in creating a new degree course is an asset which gives a university a head start in enrolment 1 Office of Communications v IC [2009] EWCA Civ 90 at paras.34 – 43 This appeal involved the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, not FOIA, but we think the same principle must apply. 8Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 not only of UK but also of overseas students, whose fees are not subject to regulation. • Even on a narrow construction, he argued, such an interest was commercial in nature, relating, as it does, to the ability of UCLAN to sell its services in competition with others. (ii) Prejudice or the likelihood of prejudice • The principal prejudice which would or would be likely to result from disclosure was the loss of that competitive advantage. Competitors, whether universities or private institutions offering alternative qualifications, would be able freely to exploit material created within UCLAN to promote their own courses, saving themselves the expenditure of resources that the independent creation of a competitor course would entail. • Moreover, potential recruits to the UCLAN course might decide that they could use course materials, including reading lists, to teach themselves homeopathy (or whatever other subject) without incurring the costs of enrolment on a three – year degree course. • This loss of recruitment was especially threatening where the occupation or profession to which the course related was unregulated and where alternative qualifications were accessible. Furthermore, private institutions with which UCLAN competed, were not required to practise reciprocal transparency. • Mr. Pitt - Payne rejected the argument that all this course material was anyway available from enrolled students on the grounds that none had a complete set at any one time and that they were unlikely to supply what they had. • A further factor was the likely damage to UCLAN `s relations with third parties who granted copyright licences strictly for the purposes of teaching the particular course. Whilst disclosure of course material to the world at large would not prejudice their rights as a matter of law, the risk of breaches 9Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 was greatly increased. UCLAN students were warned very clearly about copyright. Enforcing such rights through litigation was expensive and laborious. (iii) The balance of public interests in relation to s.43(2) • A public interest in the quality and validity of a course substantially funded by the taxpayer was acknowledged. However, it was outweighed by the interest in protecting course material from general exposure in the interests of innovation. Without such protection there was no incentive to innovate. • In an additional written submission after the close of the oral hearing2, Mr. Pitt – Payne argued that the exemption of universities from the duties imposed by the Re-Use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”) on public authorities was an indication that the European (the regulations stemmed from Directive 2003/98/EC) and the Westminster Parliaments recognised the importance of protective fostering of innovation in universities and rebutted a suggestion that the public interest lay rather in a free exposure to the public gaze of the teaching materials created. • Anyway, UCLAN already did much to enable potential students and the general public to assess the value and quality of its degree courses. Its website contained a wide range of information. It provided introductory materials to potential students, including reading lists. Moreover, standards were ensured by the validation procedures which were required before a course was launched and which involved independent expert external monitors and by quality assurance (Q.A.A.) which demands a continuing compliance with national standards. 2 Further written submissions were made as to the relevance of the 2005 Regulations after the oral proceedings, in accordance with directions given at the conclusion of the hearing. This issue had been raised by the Tribunal during the hearing. We are most grateful for the assistance provided by all parties. 10Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 • The public would gain little from an uninformed scrutiny of the requested material. That was not needed for participation in the debate on the value of a course or the academic standards prevailing. Analogies with the publication of school coursework so as to inform the vigorous debate as to standards were unhelpful. • Very few universities practised the open door policy on teaching materials advocated by Professor Colquhoun. M.I.T. was not a valid comparator. As to s.36(2)(c); (iv) The reasonableness of the Vice – Chancellor `s opinion • As to the exemption under s.36(2)(c), the opinion of the Vice – Chancellor was reasonable in substance and reasonably arrived at. • There was good reason to suppose that disclosure in this case would provoke a disruptive volume of requests for comparable material relating to a large number of other courses. Such requests would divert significant resources from more valuable activity. (v) Was it reasonably arrived at? • The procedure adopted to obtain the opinion was clearly set out in the documents. It had involved consultation with UCLAN `s solicitors. • Its validity was unaffected by its timing, that is to say after Professor Colquhoun `s complaint to the IC. (v) The balance of public interests in relation to s.36(2)(c) • As to the public interest, the disruption would be significant. Moreover, the likely damage to the trust of third parties with copyright interests in the requested material was relevant here also. 11Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 • Redaction of the third party copyright material would be far too cumbersome to meet the objection to disclosure. 19 (i) The IC `s case: s.43(2) Commercial interests • The IC argued as to s.43 that the interests that UCLAN sought to protect were financial but not commercial. It was a charity whose objective was education and the diffusion of knowledge. • We were referred to the definition of “in the nature of a commercial venture” approved by the Court of Appeal in Woodcock v Committee of the Friends School [1987] IRLR 98. The facts of the Student Loans case were far from those present here. (ii) Prejudice or the likelihood of prejudice • It was for UCLAN to show at least the likelihood of real prejudice. Speculation as to risk is not enough. • Many factors attract students to a particular institution or course, not merely the apparent course content. • UCLAN was not in the same market as private institutions, which did not have the benefit of state funding. • It was most unlikely that competitors would uncritically exploit UCLAN `s course content if disclosed, given the stigma attaching to plagiarism in the academic world. • They would know of the civil and criminal sanctions attaching to breaches of copyright and, to avoid breaches, would have to do afresh much of the work involved in creating course material, thus substantially reducing any inroads they might make on UCLAN `s competitive advantage. • The exemption from disclosure of the case histories (see paragraph 9 above) significantly protected the course material from easy imitation. 12Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 • This was not commercially sensitive material; students were not required to treat it in confidence. If it were, a competitor could obtain it for the £3,000 cost of enrolment. • It was questionable whether the materials prepared for the BSc, (Homeopathy) course had any real commercial value, having regard to the very limited number of recruits during its operation and the lack of overseas interest. • Finally, UCLAN ignored the evidence that publication of such material could positively improve recruitment by raising public awareness generally and awareness of this course in particular. We were referred to a recent article to this effect in Times Higher Education, citing the M.I.T. experience. (iii) The balance of public interests in relation to s. 43(2) Ms. Proops, for the IC, identified four elements in the public interest favouring disclosure, three general and one specific to this course. • There was a general interest in the opening up of educational processes to a broad public, most especially those who had not had the best educational opportunities • There was a need for accountability where very large public funds were involved. The public should have the means to see how its money was spent. What is the content of this course? How is it taught? By what methods and to what standard? • There was a powerful interest in opening up the content of courses to other institutions in the interests of improved teaching techniques and learning. There was no evidence that innovation was blunted by exposure. On the contrary, it could well galvanise the whole sector. • As to this BSc. (Homeopathy) course, there was considerable controversy as to its validity as a university degree course or a branch of science. 13Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 Homeopathy is unregulated, following a Parliamentary Select Committee report. The public should be able to form a judgement as to whether this is a valuable alternative or complement to conventional medicine or an unscientific amalgam of unsubstantiated beliefs. Validation and external monitoring are no answer to this point. External experts are likely to be practitioners of homeopathy or persons who accept its essential tenets. In any case, whatever the value of such scrutiny, people are entitled to reach their own view. Publication of procedures does not suffice. The same answer applies to the claim that access to the UCLAN website could satisfy public curiosity. As to s.36(2)(c); (iv) The reasonableness of the Vice – Chancellor `s opinion • UCLAN `s case was speculative. There was no evidence that disclosure would result in the forecast turmoil nor any consequent loss of income. • If it did result in an increase in applications for information, to advance that as an objection was to attempt to thwart the purpose of FOIA. • Similarly, the fear that third parties might be alienated by the threat to their copyright was unreal. None had given evidence of such a development. Their copyright would be untouched, as a matter of law and they could not reasonably object to UCLAN fulfilling its FOIA obligations, if such they were. • As to the alternative argument as to the costs of redaction, Parliament enacted s.12 of FOIA to protect public authorities from unreasonable costs of compliance and s.36 was not to be used as an illegitimate extension of s.12. Reference was made to observations of Keith J. in Home Office and Ministry of Justice v IC [2009] EWHC 1611 (Admin) at paragraph 20. (v) Was it reasonably arrived at? • This exemption was invoked late in the day 14Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 • It was thinly reasoned and evidenced. 20 Professor Colquhoun `s submissions were made in the course of his evidence. He supported the IC `s case. He emphasised that his request had been significantly narrowed. He indicated that he wanted to see the relevant modules in order to see how homeopathic principles could be squared with the discipline of, for example, biology which featured in the same course. Above all, he was concerned that universities publish their course material so that proper peer review could be practised and good teaching practices could be widely disseminated. Evidence 21 Three witnesses testified on behalf of UCLAN. To a degree, the effect of their evidence has been conveyed in the summary of the arguments that flowed from it. 22 Professor Malcolm McVicar is the Vice – Chancellor of UCLAN and it was he whose opinion is relied on for the purposes of the exemption under s. 36. He described the radical changes in the funding and the market for higher education in recent years. His witness statement gave a detailed picture of the different groups of potential consumers and their funding, full – time UK and EU undergraduates, funded by a mix of HEFCE grants and tuition fees, part – time students, international “unregulated” students whose fees are determined by the market and private and public sector concerns, which enter into full – cost contracts for award – bearing courses with UCLAN and its competitors. He emphasised how keen was the competition for all these customers. The job of a university was to remain solvent. Its HEFCE funding depended on maintaining its recruitment. Course materials represented a major investment of time and money which would be largely wasted if competitors had access to them. He contended that the public “need to know” was already met by preliminary 15Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 materials which are readily available and the processes for external monitoring referred to above. 23 He set out the problems of disruption and cost which he said would result from disclosure and which have already been described. He also dealt quite briefly with the s.36 procedure and the forming of his opinion. 24 UCLAN had not recruited to the BSc. (Homeopathy) course since September, 2007, following an internal report. It had been recruiting at the time of the request. Of itself, the suspension of this course pending regulation does not affect our determination of this appeal. 25 Mr. Peter Hyett, the Executive Director of Finance, gave more specific evidence as to the financial structure of UCLAN and the perceived results of the IC `s decision. He reported that the HEFCE block grant represented only 39% of revenue, indicating UCLAN `s dependence on other competitive activities to balance its books. Dealing specifically with the homeopathy course, he gave the figures for recruitment in the three years for which it ran. They showed that the highest recruitment was 55 UK students and 3 from overseas in its first year. 26 Professor David Phoenix, the Deputy Vice – Chancellor, gave evidence on certain of the same topics but additionally dealt with Professor Colquhoun `s evidence as to a trend towards greater openness with such materials. It came down to the point, which was not really controverted, that M.I.T. alone was truly pursuing such a policy and that its funding and status bore little comparison with the great majority of, or indeed any UK universities. Such a trend was followed by very few and in respect of a very limited number of courses. He also dealt with the processes of validation and the Q.A.A. 27 The tribunal sampled the very large volume of course material supplied and obtained a general impression of its nature. Our Decision 28 Save as to the proper construction of “commercial interests” in s.43(2), the issues for our determination involve the application of broadly agreed legal tests 16Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 to largely uncontroversial facts and, depending on the result of such application, considerations as to the balance of the public interest. 29 We are not called upon to make a definitive ruling as to the application of sections 36(2)(c) and 43(2) to all university course materials nor a general statement as to the public interest in relation to such information. Nevertheless, some arguments advanced on this appeal have a wider application and our findings will inevitably reflect that. 30 We deal first with the asserted exemption under s.43(2) which provides : “43. Commercial interests. ---- (2) Information is exempt information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (including the public authority holding it).” 31 We respectfully agree with the approach adopted by this Tribunal in the Student Loans appeal at paragraph 42, namely that “commercial interests “ is a term which deserves a broad interpretation which will depend largely on the particular context. We do not consider that the fundamentally charitable character of a university means that it should have no commercial interests. A body which depends on student fees to remain solvent has a commercial interest in maintaining the assets upon which the recruitment of students depends. Moreover, we accept on the evidence that UCLAN operates in competition with other institutions of higher education in seeking to sell its products, namely undergraduate courses, to potential students. Therefore, whether on a broad or narrow construction of the statutory words, we are satisfied that UCLAN `s interests in teaching material produced for its degree courses are properly described as “commercial”. 32 That element of the exemption established, it is then for UCLAN to show either the certainty or the likelihood of prejudice to such interests, if the requested information is disclosed. It is now well established, for the purposes of both exemptions invoked here, that “likely to prejudice” is to be construed as involving 17Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 “a significant and weighty chance of prejudice”, though it does not have to be more likely than not.3 33 We are not persuaded that such a likelihood is demonstrated in relation to the course material for the BSc.(Homeopathy) course. We found Ms. Proops` criticisms of UCLAN `s case on this issue compelling. 34 The starting point is the absence of evidence that disclosure has affected recruitment where it has taken place, though the Tribunal accepts that this has occurred only rarely and partially. More significant, in the case of this course, is the exemption of the body of case histories, without which, it seems to us, the material lacks empirical support. Any competitor would need to obtain such material before a comparable qualification could be offered, which suggests that the “head start” that innovation should earn, ought not to be significantly eroded. 35 The D.I.Y. student who might use disclosed course material to pursue his qualification at home seemed to us a rare, indeed speculative species, who would, if he existed, study under vast disadvantages (no tuition, no case studies, no degree to aim for ) which would deter him fairly swiftly from such a venture. 36 We were not impressed by the claim that third parties with copyright in the disclosed materials would be alienated by UCLAN `s compliance with a decision that this information must be provided. None gave evidence to that effect. 37 It was not clear to us how a competitor could significantly exploit access to this material, without infringing UCLAN `s copyright or brazenly aping the content of a course, which would surely attract the scorn of the wider academic community. Moreover, it seemed to us likely that most potential students would be attracted to a particular course by the reputation of the teaching staff and a range of extra – curricular factors at least as much as by a comparative study of the powerpoint presentations and notes provided to current students. 3 See John Connor Press Associates v IC EA/2005/0005at para.15, Guardian Newspapers v IC and the BBC EA/2006/0011 at para.53, adopting the words of Munby J. in R (on the application of Lord) v Home Office [2003] EWHC 2073 (Admin) at para.100 18Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 38 Whilst there may be dangers in equating university competition for students with competition within the professions, we note that accountants, solicitors and barristers` chambers, for marketing purposes, routinely publicise without charge the fruits of their experience and professed expertise in the shape of articles, seminars and web – based instruction. Ms. Proops ` argument that UCLAN undervalues the commercial advantages of publishing its wares has some force, we conclude. 39 Finally, in this particular case, we doubt whether this course had a significant commercial value, given the limited enrolment and the virtual absence of overseas interest. 40 In the light of this finding, it is not strictly necessary to decide the balance of public interest as to disclosure. Nevertheless, since the issue has been carefully and very fully argued, we shall indicate shortly our view, had the likelihood of prejudice been established. 41 As ever, the question is whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the interest in disclosure. 42 It is plainly important that universities should be encouraged to innovate in the courses that they offer and in the methods of teaching that they employ. The question is whether disclosure of course material, specifically in this instance but with an eye to the wider picture, will blunt the urge to innovate by removing the incentive. 43 In the case of this BSc course, considered as at July, 2006, we doubt whether disclosure would have produced such an effect, largely for reasons given in the discussion on prejudice. Only one other university offered a comparable qualification. There was little or no sign of competitors anxious to take advantage of UCLAN `s work, at least in the near future. We agree with the Commissioner that private institutions, unsupported by state funds and unable to award degrees, are not truly operating in the same market. 44 More generally, it seems likely that this issue would arise, if at all, in the case of vocational courses, especially the entirely novel or those of recent origin. For 19Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 reasons set out in paragraphs 34 – 38, we remain unconvinced of any general discouragement to innovation resulting from corresponding disclosure. That would require a pattern of recruitment lost to parasitic competitors who can exploit disclosure with sufficient speed, resource and publicity to destroy any head start or competitive advantage to which the innovator is entitled. We accept that the issue would need re – examination in each case. There might be some where such long - term disincentive could be shown but much clearer evidence would be required than has been presented to us. 45 As to UCLAN `s submission based on the 2005 Regulations, we consider that they offer at best, very limited assistance to this argument as to innovation. We note that : (i) The Regulations are concerned, not with information, but with the re – use of documents held by public authorities where, but for the regulations, such re – use would or might constitute a breach of the authority `s copyright. Copyright is preserved. Re – use requires an application. The authority may refuse, subject to appeal, or place conditions on re – use. Documents containing third party copyright material are excluded. (ii) The authority is empowered, by Reg.7 to make its documents available for re – use, as defined by Reg.4. In contrast with FOIA, it is under no general duty to do so. (iii) The exclusions set out in Reg. 5(3) apply to a wide range of educational and cultural establishments, some of which, such as schools, libraries and archives are not obviously vulnerable to the disincentives to innovation said to result in the case of universities from disclosure of documents revealing how they work. (iv) The 2005 Regulations impose significant burdens on authorities which make documents available for re – use, including the maintenance of a list of main documents available for re – use (see generally Reg.16). (v) As noted already, the 2005 Regulations derive from Directive 2003/98/EC. The explanatory memorandum published by the European 20Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 Commission, at p.9, briefly explains the exclusion of the institutions described in Reg.5(c) “(They) merit a special treatment in view of a combination of different factors .The application of the directive may cause a relatively high administrative burden for them in comparison with the benefits to be gained. Much of their information would anyhow fall outside the scope of the Directive in view of third party copyrights. Finally, their function in society as carriers of culture and knowledge give them a special position.” The thinking behind the exclusion is clearly set out in the second and third sentences. Whatever the implication of the last sentence, it does not seem to refer to the need to protect them from discouragement from innovation. Why any exclusion is needed in the absence of a duty to permit re – use is not obvious but that consideration is immaterial to the point in issue. 46 The public interest in disclosure seems to us appreciably stronger. Apart from the universal arguments about transparency and the improvement of public awareness, we find that there are particular interests here, arising from the nature of a university and the way it is funded. 47 First, the public has a legitimate interest in monitoring the content and the academic quality of a course, particularly a relatively new course in a new area of study, funded, to a very significant extent, by the taxpayer. It is no answer, we consider, to say that this function is performed by the process of validation or the continuing monitoring of standards with external input. Whether or not these processes are conducted with critical rigour, it must be open to those outside the academic community to question what is being taught and to what level in our universities. The apparent perception in some quarters that the intellectual demands of some or many degree courses have been relaxed, that higher classes of degree are too lightly earned, may be largely or entirely unfounded. But it is highly important that the material necessary to a fair judgement be available. That material will often, if not always, include the basic content of the course, such as is requested here. 21Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 48 Secondly, this is especially the case where, as with the BSc. (Homeopathy), there is significant public controversy as to the value of such study within a university. In this case, that factor standing alone would have persuaded us that the balance of public interest favoured disclosure. 49 We are not attracted by the somewhat patrician argument that the general public, uninstructed in the specialist subject under scrutiny, would be incapable of forming a proper judgement. That might be so, were it impossible to seek independent expertise to assist in making an assessment. Happily, it is not. 50 Finally, there is a public interest in opening up new methods of teaching and new insights as to the content of courses, so as to stimulate the spread of good practice. 51 As to the second exemption claimed, section 36, so far as material, reads : 36.— Prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs. (1) This section applies to— ---- (b) information which is held by any other public authority. 2) Information to which this section applies is exempt information if, in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person, disclosure of the information under this Act— ---- (c) would otherwise prejudice, or would be likely otherwise to prejudice, the effective conduct of public affairs. As noted at paragraph 17, it is common ground, established as to (iii), by the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, that this exemption is engaged if three requirements are met. They can be shortly labelled (i) “qualified person” 22Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 (ii) “reasonable opinion” (iii) “reasonably arrived at” 52 The evidence as to the Vice – Chancellor `s qualification, pursuant to s.36(5)(o) has to be sought from a website. Whether or not it was properly proved, neither the Commissioner nor Professor Colquhoun took any point as to admissibility and, in the circumstances of this appeal, we shall proceed on the basis that qualification was established. 53 We observe, however, that the qualification of the person, upon whose opinion reliance is placed, requires proof and should be readily ascertainable by the requester. Save for authorities identified specifically in s.36(5) (a) to (n), it must be clearly shown to the requester, the Commissioner and in evidence to the Tribunal, either that the opinion is that of a minister of the crown ((o)(i) or that the minister has designated the authority or official giving the opinion as the qualified person ((o)(ii) and (iii)). 54 We regard the claim of disruption and consequent expense resulting from a flood of similar requests prompted by disclosure of this information as tenuous. Moreover, if such requests were likely, such an argument runs counter to the fundamental philosophy of FOIA, assuming them to be made in good faith. It amounts to saying: if we comply with this request we shall have to comply with a mass of others. 55 The argument as to third party alienation as a result of perceived threats to copyright we have already considered. The problem arising from the alternative solution of redaction of such material from what is disclosed is said to be the commitment of time, hence the cost involved. The types of work to be included in estimating the cost of compliance with information requests are dealt with in s.12 of FOIA and reg. 4(3) of the Freedom of Information and Data Protection 23Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations, 2004 (“the 2004 regulations”). They do not provide for the costs of redaction. The reasoning of Keith J. at paragraph 20 of Home Office and Ministry of Justice v IC [2009] EWHC 1611 (Admin), addressing the use of s.36 to circumvent the limits on the type of work covered by s.12 and reg. 4(3) of the 2004 Regulations holds good for this argument also, in our judgement. If Parliament had intended the need for such work to create an exemption, it would have drafted s.12 and/or the 2004 regulations accordingly. It is not permissible to use s. 36(2)(c) to extend the ambit of s.12. 56 A reasonable opinion may be one with which the Tribunal emphatically disagrees, provided it is based on sound argument and evidence. With great respect to Professor McVicar, whose sincerity is not in question, we can find no adequate evidential basis for this opinion and consider that it rests on two misconceptions as to the application of FOIA. We do not find that it passes the required test of objective reasonableness. 57 We considered separately whether the opinion was reasonably arrived at. Again, our answer is no. 58 Section 36 provides for an exceptional exemption which the public authority creates by its own action, albeit subject to scrutiny of its reasonableness, the likelihood of prejudice and the question of the public interest. That factor of itself justifies a requirement that the authority provide substantial evidence as to the advice (other than legal advice) and the arguments presented to the qualified person upon which his opinion was founded. We emphasise that no set formula is required, just a simple clear record of the process. 24Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 59 The need for such evidence is all the greater where, as here, the authority invokes s.36 for the first time after the complaint to the IC4. 60 The evidence consists of a briefly argued e mail from Mrs. Bostock suggesting that s.36(2)(c) be invoked on the very broadly argued grounds already reviewed. The tone implicitly acknowledges that the claim is rather speculative. We are not concerned with the slightly uncertain use of “possibility” and “likely” but the impression left is of a last – minute idea, not really thought through or investigated but merely discussed with solicitors to tie it in to FOIA. It was sent to the Vice – Chancellor at 3.20pm. on a Friday afternoon, 26th. September, 2008, asking for the Vice – Chancellor `s agreement. That agreement was forthcoming in a single sentence without further comment in an e mail reply timed at 12.05pm.on the following Monday. 61 We find that the process of forming the necessary opinion was, to say the least, perfunctory, indeed far short of the careful assessment and investigation that normally supports a qualified opinion for the purposes of s.36. 62 Accordingly, we do not find that it was reasonably arrived at. Conclusion 63 It is for these reasons that we uphold the Decision Notice. We record our gratitude for the helpful and succinct submissions of counsel on both sides and the incisive contribution of Professor Colquhoun. We 4 In the Student Loans appeal, reliance was placed on an opinion formed after the Decision Notice issued by the IC. The Tribunal ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to consider an exemption, the factual basis of which had not existed at the date of the Decision Notice, since its task was to decide whether that Notice was in accordance with the law (s.58(1)(a)). We do not consider that jurisdiction is excluded where, as here, the Commissioner was able to and did rule on the s.36 exemption in the Decision Notice, even though it was not relied on at the time of the request. Our attention was very properly drawn by Ms. Proops, in her additional submission after the hearing, to the very recent decision of a differently constituted Tribunal in Roberts v IC & DBIS EA/2009/0035, 20 November 2009 to the effect that s.36 could only be invoked by a public authority before the complaint to the IC. She indicated that the Commissioner did not intend to rely on it, partly because he was uncertain that it was correct. We think that that concession was properly made. With respect to the Tribunal that decided Roberts, we are not minded to follow it. 25Appeal Number: EA/2009/0034 wish to add that, whilst we have not accepted the great majority of the arguments advanced by UCLAN, we do not in any way seek to cast doubt on the veracity of the evidence of its witnesses, nor the honesty and loyalty with which they have sought to serve its interests. 64 Our decision is unanimous Signed: David Farrer Q.C.

"2041","EIR","Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 Information Commissioner’s Ref: FS50124420 Heard at Tax and Lands Tribunal, London WC1 Decision Promulgated On 2 June 2009 On 22 June 2009 BEFORE CHAIRMAN ROBIN CALLENDER SMITH and LAY MEMBERS DAVE SIVERS PAUL TAYLOR Between ERIC JENNINGS Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Subject matter: - Rule 10 Cases: Billings v Information Commissioner [EA/2007/0076] and Tanner v Information Commissioner and Commissioners for Revenue and Customs [EA/2007/0106]. 1Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 Representation: For the Appellant: in person. For the Respondent: Mr James Boddy (Counsel on behalf of the Information Commissioner). Decision 1. The Tribunal dealt with this matter under the provisions of Rule 10 of the Information Tribunal (Enforcement Appeals) Rules 2005. This appeal has been disposed of summarily. 2. This followed an oral pre-Directions hearing on 1 April 2009 involving all parties and a full oral hearing in respect of the application for summary disposal – again involving all parties – heard on 1 June 2009. Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. Mr Eric Jennings requested OfSTED to provide information concerning a reference in a school inspection report to the phrase that a particular school’s governing body had “effectively addressed some difficulties”. 2. OfSTED’s original response to this request for information came in a letter dated 30 March 2006 and stated that it did not hold the information. Mr Jennings responded to this letter by having telephone conversations with OfSTED and – as a result – wrote again on 25 May 2006 to OfSTED with a more detailed request for information. This letter included a further and different request for information which was not referred to the Information Commissioner and is not part of the Decision Notice or this appeal. OfSTED responded to the second letter by stating that it was the same as the original request and repeating that it did not hold the requested information. 2Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 3. Mr Jennings then sought an internal review of the decision. This ultimately provided Mr Jennings with a copy of the notes taken by the Inspector of the interview with him. It also provided a quote from the interview notes with the Chair of Governors of the school that the governing body “has had to deal with considerable problems over the last six years – only resolved in the last two years”. This information was provided to demonstrate the lack of information held. OfSTED maintained it did not hold the information subject to the request. 4. At this stage Mr Jennings complained to the Information Commissioner on 28 June 2006 about those responses. 5. Subsequently – and outside of the Act – Mr Jennings was provided by OfSTED with an entire copy of the interview notes from the meeting with the Chair of Governors. There were no further references in the notes to any “difficulties” faced by the school. The Tribunal has seen that document in the closed evidence it has considered in this appeal. 6. In a Decision Notice dated 8 December 2008 the Commissioner concluded that OfSTED had supplied Mr Jennings with the information, did not hold any further information within the scope of the request and that OFSTED had breached section 10 (1) FOIA by not providing the information within 20 working days. The Decision Notice also contained consideration of whether there had been a breach of section 16 (something which is not the subject of this appeal). 7. In the ""Other Matters"" section of the decision notice the Commissioner commented about the Appellant's concern that OfSTED had deliberately delayed or avoided providing the information requested in the following terms: ""Finally, the Commissioner notes that the complainant seems to feel that the PA deliberately delayed or avoided providing the information requested. Such an issue, if found to be the case, would have been a breach of section 77 of the Act. The Commissioner is satisfied that there is no evidence of his having taken place. Although it later (when requested to do so by the Commissioner) provided the complete evidence form document, (from the meeting between the Inspector and the Chair of Governors) to the complainant, it does not appear that the rest of the documents beyond the quota provided at internal review stage is relevant to the 3Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 request. The pertinent information therefore was disclosed, albeit not until review stage. No deliberate delay appears to have occurred."" The appeal to the Tribunal 8. The single ground of appeal contained in the Notice of Appeal was that ""OfSTED deliberately held information. See attached*”. Background was expanded on in a handwritten attachment to the Notice of Appeal where reference was made to copies of correspondence attached to the Notice of Appeal. The questions for the Tribunal 9. The Tribunal had to consider Rule 10 which states: (1) Where, having considered – (a) the notice of appeal, and (b) any reply to the notice of appeal, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the appeal is of such a nature that it can properly be determined by dismissing it forthwith it may, subject to the provisions of this rule, so determine the appeal. … (5) Where an appellant requests a hearing under paragraph (4) (b) above the Tribunal shall, as soon as practicable and with due regard to the convenience of the appellant, appoint a time and place for a hearing. 10. The Tribunal has previously concluded (Tanner v Information Commissioner and the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs EA/2007/0016) that the appropriate test for summary dismissal under rule 10 is similar to the test under Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. 11. Part 24 makes provision for a claim which has no real prospect of success to be summarily dismissed. In the case of Tanner the Tribunal adopted guidance on the meaning of the test as provided in Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER (CA) by Lord Woolf MR. In particular the words ""no real prospect of being successful or 4Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 succeeding"" spoke for themselves and meant that the Tribunal had to decide whether there was a ""realistic"" as opposed to a ""fanciful"" prospect of success (at para 4). Evidence 11. Mr Jennings submitted a three-page letter in support of his appeal which he adopted as his evidence. He did not add to it further in his oral evidence to the Tribunal beyond saying that he remained dissatisfied with the way OfSTED had dealt with the matter. 12. The core of his complaint is summarised at the end of this letter. It reads: ""OfSTED has stated, in trying to conceal the fact that they deliberately withheld information, in correspondence that I have obtained from the Information Commissioner, using the Freedom of Information Act, that my Freedom of Information request was either, not recorded, when clearly the information I requested was there, e.g. Evidence Forms one and two. Or, OfSTED stated that, because I had requested information from OfSTED using the Freedom of Information Act, at the same time that I contacted the Independent Complaints Adjudicator, I must have confused myself owing to the fact that the Information Commissioner and the Independent Complaints Adjudicator have different procedures. I have had dealings since 2001 [and] there is no way I have confused myself. I know/knew exactly what I was doing. OfSTED even went so far as to state, when they sent the Independent Complaints Adjudicator their OfSTED school inspection file containing the information that they told me did not exist, that the Independent Complaints Adjudicator had her own disclosure regime. What the Independent Complaints Adjudicator’s disclosure regime has to do with regard to a Freedom of Information Act request to OfSTED, I have absolutely no idea. The letter dated 27 February 2008 from OfSTED to the Commissioner is a vital piece of evidence that proves OfSTED knew what I wanted, knew what they had, knew what took place at the meeting, and deliberately withheld [this].” Legal submissions and analysis 5Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 13. Mr Boddy, Counsel for the Commissioner, drew the Tribunal's attention to Tanner and Billings v The Information Commissioner (EA/2007/0076). 14. He also drew the Tribunal's attention to Mr Jennings’ allegation in the grounds of appeal that OfSTED ""deliberately held"" information. That was an allegation under section 77 for FOIA. Section 77 provides: 77 (1) Where – (a) a request for information has been made to a public authority, and (b) under section 1 of this Act…. the applicant would have been entitled… to communication of any information in accordance with that section, any person to whom this subsection applies is guilty of an offence if he alters, defaces, blocks, erases, destroys or conceals any record held by the public authority, with the intention of preventing the disclosure by that authority of all, or any part, of the information to the communication of which the applicant would have been entitled. …. (4) No proceedings for an offence under this section shall be instituted – (a) in England and Wales, except by the Commissioner or by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 15. He submitted that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider issues relating to section 77 and invited the Tribunal to dismiss the Appeal under Rule 10. Conclusion and remedy 16. The Tribunal notes the extensive background to this appeal, the matters in relation to OfSTED and the education issues in relation to Mr Jenning’s son that have so understandably exercised Mr Jennings. 17. The Tribunal also notes that Mr Jennings has been able to obtain, from OfSTED, outside FOIA, disclosure of the information he had been seeking all along. 6Appeal Number: EA/2008/0099 18. The Tribunal clearly has no jurisdiction to consider issues relating to section 77 and potential prosecutions under FOIA. Those are properly and correctly reserved to the Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions in the statutory legislation. 19. In terms of the “Other Matters” section of the Commissioner’s Decision Notice in this case, the Tribunal finds the Billings case useful and informative. In particular, at paragraph 8 in Billings: “As the “Other Matters” section did not form part of the reasoning by which the Information Commissioner reached his decision, there is no basis upon which the criticism may be said to demonstrate that the Decision Notice did not comply with the law. This is not therefore a ground of appeal that we can contemplate.” 20. In the appeal before this Tribunal Mr Jennings makes no challenge to the conclusion reached by the Information Commissioner. Mr Jennings is seeking to have the Tribunal consider a matter relating to the conduct of the public authority, not whether the Commissioner’s decision was in accordance with the law. 21. Such a situation means that the operation of Rule 10 is appropriate to dispose of this appeal. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the appeal is of such a nature that it can properly be determined by dismissing it forthwith. Applying the test in Swain v Hillman there is no realistic prospect of it being successful or succeeding. 22. There is no order as to costs in this appeal. 23. Our decision is unanimous.

"2091","EIR","Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2007/0116 Information Commissioner’s Ref: FS50150404 Heard at Field House, London, EC4 Decision Promulgated On 4th & 7th March 2008 14th March 2008 BEFORE CHAIRWOMAN Melanie Carter and LAY MEMBERS Dr Henry Fitzhugh Rosalind Tatam Between HEALTH PROFESSIONS COUNCIL Appellant and INFORMATION COMMISSIONER Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: William Hoskins For the Respondent: Elisa Holmes 1Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: Decision The Tribunal upholds the Information Notice dated 1 October 2007 and dismisses the appeal. Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This appeal arises from an Information Notice issued by the Information Commissioner to the Health Professions Council (HPC) on the 1 October 2007. The Information Notice related to an information request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) by Ms Sue Lee in a letter dated 1 January 2007. That request was refused by the HPC and Ms Lee applied to the Information Commissioner under section 50 of the FOIA. As part of the Information Commissioner’s investigation, he issued an Information Notice requesting sight of the disputed information which the HPC had refused to disclose to Ms. Lee. The HPC has appealed the Information Notice under section 57(2) of FOIA. 2. The Tribunal noted that the investigation of Ms Lee’s section 50 application has been put on hold pending the determination of this appeal. Hence there is still no resolution of her request for information under FOIA made in January 2007. For this reason the Tribunal had sought to expedite the hearing of this appeal and was grateful to the parties for their observance of what was a relatively tight timescale for bringing the case to hearing. The Tribunal did not call for the disputed information as it was of the view that this case should be decided without regard to the subject matter of the request or the correctness or otherwise of the exemptions claimed. Background 3. The HPC is established under the Health Professions Order 2001 (the 2001 Order) and has responsibility for the regulation of 13 different types of health professionals. Its main functions are set out at article 3(2) of the 2001 Order as: 2Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: “…to establish from time to time standards of education, training, conduct and performance for members of the relevant professions and to ensure the maintenance of those standards.” The main objective in exercising its functions is “to safeguard the health and well- being of persons using or needing the services of registrants.” 4. The HPC’s functions include the maintenance of a register of health professionals and a mechanism, called the Fitness to Practise process (the Process) whereby the conduct and performance of registrants may be investigated and called to account. An adverse adjudication on a registrant’s fitness to practise may lead to, amongst other things, a registrant being removed from the register (such that they could not work in their chosen profession) or conditions being attached to the performance of their profession. 5. Members of the public, employers etc. may make allegations to the HPC with regard to the fitness to practise of particular registrants. Such cases are investigated by the HPC and as a preliminary step in the Process a decision will be taken by a Panel of the Investigating Committee (the Investigating Committee) whether there is ‘a case to answer’. Where it is decided that there is not, that will be the end of the case against the registrant. Where the Investigating Committee decides there is case to answer this is referred to a different Committee for a full hearing. The original request for information 6. Ms. Lee made an allegation to the HPC that a particular registrant’s fitness to practise was impaired. This was investigated and papers duly put before the Investigating Committee. The Committee decided that there was no case to answer. Ms. Lee, who was unhappy with this decision, then made a FOIA request in relation to the papers that were put to the Investigating Committee. This was refused by the HPC on the grounds that certain exemptions applied, namely sections 30 (investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities), 40 (personal data) and 41 (confidentiality). 3Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: The application to the Information Commissioner 7. Ms. Lee then made an application under section 50 of FOIA for a decision by the Information Commissioner as to her whether request had been dealt with in accordance with law. As part of his investigation, the Information Commissioner sought to be provided with the disputed information which had not been provided to Ms. Lee. Initially he sought this without recourse to the issuing of an Information Notice. The HPC resisted on the basis that, absent a formal Information Notice, it did not have the power to disclose the information. 8. The HPC set out its concerns in correspondence over the months of July to September 2007 as to the potential damage to the Process were registrants to be aware that information had been passed to the Information Commissioner. 9. The Information Notice was issued on 1 October 2007 and the HPC filed a Notification of Appeal against the Notice on 29 October 2007. The appeal to the Tribunal 10. The HPC’s grounds of appeal have been refined during the course of the proceedings and certain have been dropped. Counsel for the HPC at the hearing set out the appeal on the grounds that the Information Commissioner had either (a) erred in exercising his discretion to issue an Information Notice and/or (b) the Information Notice was not in accordance with the law on the basis that the Commissioner had failed to have regard to relevant matters, namely the way in which the Process would be undermined as a result of the Notice. It was argued that, as registrants believed that the information they provided to HPC at the ‘case to answer’ stage was confidential, the effect of the Information Notice would be to discourage the provision of information at this early stage, for fear of disclosure to the Commissioner and onward disclosure by the Commissioner to the public. Counsel for the HPC accepted at the hearing that the two grounds of appeal were, for practical purposes, identical. The questions for the Tribunal 11. The Tribunal considered: 4Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: a. whether the net effect of: i. the practises and procedures of the Information Commissioner; and ii. the prohibition against disclosure under section 59 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), was a sufficient guarantee of the Information Commissioner keeping the disclosed information confidential to negate or at least substantially reduce the perceived fears of registrants and therefore the purported damage to the Process; b. whether, in the light of the above, the purported damage to the Process was, as argued, sufficiently serious to mean that the Information Commissioner ought to have exercised his discretion differently and not to have issued the Information Notice; c. whether the Information Commissioner had failed to take into account relevant considerations, namely the potential damage to the Process in the exercise of his discretion. Evidence 12. The Tribunal heard evidence from Mr Jonathan Bracken from Bircham Dyson Bell, solicitors for the HPC. Mr Bracken has been involved in the setting up of the HPC, had advised on many of its processes and drafted its rules. 13. Mr Bracken explained to the Tribunal that the HPC had moved away from a punitive disciplinary scheme and had put in its place the Fitness to Practise regime, common to many health profession regulators. The HPC seeks to strike a balance between the regulator’s primary function of public protection and having non- punitive methods of addressing concerns about the competence and conduct of registrants. 14. The Process is in two stages. The first is to investigate the allegation, including taking statements where appropriate. The investigation papers are put before the Investigating Committee which decides in a private meeting, whether there is a 5Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: case for the registrant to answer. If so, the allegation is publicised and the matter goes forward to either a Conduct and Competence or Health Committee hearing which is normally held in public. If it is decided that there is no case to answer, the papers are ‘sealed’ and kept confidential. They are retained however for three years should a further similar matter come to light. 15. The test to be applied by the Investigating Committee in the first stage of the Process is whether there is a case to answer that the fitness to practise of the registrant is impaired by reason of one of several specified grounds (e.g.: misconduct, lack of competence, ill health etc.). As this test is expressed in the present tense (vis “is impaired”) the Committee is looking for evidence of the registrant’s current and possibly future conduct and competence. 16. Mr Bracken explained that the Process had been designed to promote the maximum level of frankness from those providing information at this stage. In practise, registrants provide a wide range of information that would not have been provided under the old model of a disciplinary regime (in which registrants keep back their mitigating evidence until a finding of breach). This information often involves expressions of regret, apologies or private matters as to health and relationships etc. The HPC’s aim is, in appropriate cases, to avoid striking from the register those registrants who, perhaps with remedial help, could properly remain in service - hence the non-punitive approach. 17. Mr Bracken gave evidence that it was his belief that registrants were only prepared to give this wider range of information to the HPC, as they received assurances of confidentiality and understood that their information would not be made public. He was concerned that were registrants and others to be aware of the possibility of disclosure to the Information Commissioner and then possible further disclosure to the public (including the original complainant), that this source of information would be undermined. He felt that this would have a major negative impact on the HPC’s ability to carry out its functions and therefore the protection of the public. 18. The Tribunal asked Mr Bracken to point out any documentary evidence of the confidentiality assurances given. It appeared however that HPC officials gave these over the telephone (see, however, paragraph 22). The Investigation Manual 6Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: provided to the Tribunal and the standard letters did not reflect this practise. Indeed, the standard letter to registrants subject to a complaint states that “any representation you make may also be sent to the person who made the allegation against you (to clarify any points raised) and you should bear this in mind in preparing your response”. Mr Bracken felt that this was perhaps not as well worded as it might be and that in reality it rarely happens that information from a registrant is sent to a complainant (and if information is sent it is restricted to a selection of the information provided). He pointed out that as a matter of law, the HPC was not obliged to share this information with a complainant. 19. It was his evidence that where the Investigating Committee found a case to answer, registrants would understand that they would have a choice whether anything they said to date would be passed on to the next stage. That way, the registrant was given the maximum opportunity for frankness at the early stage without any prejudice to a final fitness to practise determination. Mr Bracken confirmed that this assurance was again given over the telephone and was, as far as he was aware, not reflected in the HPC standard documentation. 20. Mr Neil Willis, a Biomedical Scientist, registrant and Council member, gave evidence with regard to registrants’ perceptions and the possible fears they would have if the Information Notice was to be upheld. He said that he would be reluctant to provide detailed personal information if he believed it may be handed over to a third party or made public. This was especially since, if the complaint proceeded, he would be offered the chance to decide what information went forward to the full hearing. He was particularly concerned at the possibility of disclosure of witness information to the public and possible embarrassment for the registrant’s colleagues. Mr Willis’ evidence supported Mr Bracken’s but as he had never had an allegation actually made against him he was unable to help on how and in what terms assurances of confidentiality were given to registrants. 21. Finally, the Tribunal heard from Ms Kelly Johnson, the Director of Fitness to Practise. Ms Johnson pointed out that the complainant may be contacted during the investigation to clarify specific points of fact arising from the registrant’s observations. The observations themselves were not provided to the registrant. 7Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: She told the Tribunal that the standard letter referred to at paragraph 18 above was a “carry-over” from an old letter and not in line with the HPC’s current procedures. 22. It was Ms Johnson’s evidence that not all registrants would in fact contact the HPC by phone and she accepted that given this, not all registrants would have been given an assurance as to the confidentiality of the information provided. 23. Ms Johnson was asked why, if the confidentiality of the registrants’ information was considered so important by the HPC, their guidance and standard documentation did not reflect this. She responded that their practice and procedure guidance were living documents and in certain respects in need of revision. She was of the view however that given that the Investigating Committee decision was made in private, a matter made clear to all registrants in their leaflets and letters, they would assume from this that their information would be treated confidentially. 24. Finally, she told the Tribunal that there was a theoretical possibility that fitness to practise information at this early stage could be shared with the competent authorities of other European Union states. In addition, circumstances could arise in which the HPC gave the police a registrant’s information prior to a no case to answer determination. Registrants were not warned of these possible public interest disclosures. 25. The real concern, she said, was the disclosure to the public that may follow a disclosure to the Information Commissioner. In particular, registrants would fear that complainants would thereby have access to the information. The examples given were where the registrant had raised physical or mental health or relationship issues. She accepted however that this information would likely all be personal data such that the Information Commissioner would not be free, on account of the DPA, to make disclosure to third parties. 26. In the light of this Ms. Johnson further accepted that, given the possible applicable exemptions, the Information Commissioner’s own policies on non-disclosure and the operation of section 59 DPA, the registrants’ fears might be said to be misplaced or exaggerated. 8Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: 27. She was asked as to the possible implications of the damage to the Process. She felt that there would be a significant rise in the number of cases where the Investigating Committee found there to be a case to answer. This would in turn place an additional cost on the HPC and as a consequence push up its registration fee. She pointed also to the hardship that a registrant may face where it became public that there had been an allegation made against him or her in circumstances in which there was in fact no case to answer. She accepted however that it was in the registrant’s self-interest to be open with the HPC at this early stage as this might be said to be the best way of ensuring that the matter went no further and did not become public. Legal submissions and analysis: HPC 28. Counsel for the HPC argued that the Council was under a duty of confidence owed to the registrant, arising from the nature of the relationship. He took the Tribunal through the relevant powers and duties of the HPC to substantiate his assertion that there was nothing in the Order which obliged disclosure at this early stage. He did acknowledge however that article 22(10) of the Order provided: “The Council may disclose to any person any information relating to a person’s fitness to practise which it considers to be in the public interest to disclose”. 29. This reflected the so-called ‘public interest disclosures’ that would fall within a public interest defence to a claim of breach of confidence. So, for instance, the HPC was unlikely to be in breach of a duty of confidence if it disclosed a child protection matter to the police or social services. 30. It was argued by the HPC that the Information Commissioner failed to take into account the way in which the Process would be undermined if registrants were aware of the possible disclosure to the Commissioner. Counsel took the Tribunal to a letter dated 31st August 2007 from the Information Commissioner’s Office to the HPC to evidence that the Commissioner had failed to take into account the possible damage that would ensue from disclosure to the Commissioner himself rather than the damage that might flow from onwards disclosure to the public by the Commissioner (emphasis supplied): 9Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: “I appreciate the HPC’s explanation that the purpose of the fitness to practise process is to protect patients in a non-punitive way. The HPC has provided arguments as to why disclosure may damage this process and that this may harm a registrant. However these appear to be arguments to support its reasons why the information should not be disclosed to the public. They are not grounds to justify not providing the Commissioner with access to the withheld information. This information is necessary to enable him to carry out his role of adjudicating on a public authority’s compliance with the Act. It would not be prudent for him to do so without having sight of the withheld information. The information is required to allow him to consider the strength and/or validity of arguments put forward by the public authority to justify its reliance on any exemptions under the Act. “ 31. Counsel for the HPC drew the Tribunal’s attention to a leaflet entitled “what happens if a complaint is made about me”. At page 4 of this document, registrants are informed that the Investigating Committee will meet in private and that if a case to answer is found then the HPC is obliged to publicise referrals (the details to be referred including only name, registration number and the allegation). 32. The HPC argued that with regard to fear of onward disclosure by the Information Commissioner the Tribunal needed to consider whether section 59 DPA provided sufficient guarantees of the Commissioner keeping the information confidential. Section 59 provides: ”59. (1) No person who is or has been the Commissioner, a member of the Commissioner’s staff or an agent of the Commissioner shall disclose any information which – (a) had been obtained by, or furnished to, the Commissioner under or for the purposes of the information Act, (b) relates to an identified or identifiable individual or business, and (c) is not at the time of the disclosure, and has not previously been, available to the public from other sources, 10Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: unless the disclosure is made with lawful authority.” (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) a disclosure of information is made with lawful authority only if, and to the extent that – (a) the disclosure is made with the consent of the individual or of the person for the time being carrying on the business, (b) …….. (c) the disclosure is made for the purposes of, and is necessary for, the discharge of: (i) any functions under the information Acts, or (ii) …………… (d) …………….. (e) having regard to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of any person, the disclosure is necessary in the public interest” Breach of this provision is a criminal offence. 33. He took the Tribunal to paragraph 42 of an earlier case of the Tribunal, Friends of the Earth v Information Commission and DTI (Appeal no. EA/2006/0036)(“the FOE case”), in which it considered the effect of section 59(2)(c) of the DPA: ”If a public authority withheld its consent to publish harmless information that could not be regarded as confidential, in the Tribunal’s view no offence would be committed if the Commissioner or his staff disclosed it. Although the Commissioner decided on balance in this case that disclosure would have been likely to impede the free flow of information, a decision which was in the Tribunal’s view justifiable, an alternative decision was available to him. The Commissioner and his staff should in the Tribunal’s view consider themselves free to strike a responsible balance between the conflicting considerations favouring disclosure or non-disclosure as the facts of each case require. Section 59 is a sanction against unauthorised or reckless breach of 11Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: confidentiality and it is not a necessary requirement of the directive that it should go any wider than underpinning the duty of professional secrecy with regard to confidential information as required by article 28. The duty to protect individual privacy of third parties whose information is at issue is in many data protections cases likely to be the overriding consideration. But where the Commissioner is exercising functions under the Freedom of Information Act, the broad purpose of which is to confer statutory rights of access to information, an overriding right of the public authority to withhold its consent to disclosure would contradict the purposes of the legislation. It is right that in each case the Commissioner should be able to balance the importance of the free flow of information contemplated by the letter and spirit of sections 58 and 59, and the case for disclosure of information relating to the public authority which would in his opinion, be necessary for the purpose of performing his functions, whether or not the consent of the public authority is forthcoming.” 34. In relation to section 59(2)(e) the Tribunal said at paragraph 44: “The Tribunal agrees that at least four elements enter into the equation, namely, first the extent of the legitimate interests of the FOE, second, the extent of the DTI’s interests, third, the public interest in ensuring that there is a transparent public understanding as to the manner in which the Commissioner discharges his functions and fourth and finally, that perhaps countervailing public interest in protecting the ability of the Commissioner to carry out its statutory function under section 50” 35. Counsel submitted that, further to the above analysis, the terms of section 59(2)(c ) and (e) are such that the Information Commissioner may exercise a discretion that he should make disclosure or conclude that he is obliged to disclose to the public in circumstances in which the HPC would not. In this way it was argued that the confidentiality enjoyed by the registrant was diminished by the information being passed to the Information Commissioner. Section 59 was not, it was argued, a sufficient guarantee to assuage the registrants’ fears. Legal submissions and analysis: Information Commissioner 12Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: 36. Counsel for the Information Commissioner invited the Tribunal to consider the statutory scheme underpinning Information Notices. The Information Commissioner is responsible for the regulation of the compliance by public authorities of their powers and duties under the FOIA. The HPC is listed in Part 6 of Schedule 1 as an authority to which the Act applies. The Act provides powers for the Commissioner to require production of information where a section 50 application has been made or for the purposes of his functions. It was clearly contemplated by Parliament that the Commissioner was to have the power to issue the Information Notice in a case such as this in the furtherance of his functions. 37. Counsel told the Tribunal that very exceptionally the application of exemptions may be evident to the Commissioner without his having to see the disputed information (a simple list of names and addresses, for instance) but in practise he would almost always have to see the information to carry out his duties. 38. It was submitted that there were sufficient guarantees as to safe treatment of such information to assuage, if not negate, the purported fears of registrants. Most notably, section 59 created the criminal offence which prohibited onward disclosure other than with lawful authority. 39. Counsel for the Information Commissioner emphasised that for there to be a disclosure with lawful authority under section 59 a test of necessity would apply – such that there was a high threshold to be met. 40. She also drew the Tribunal’s attention to the ICO document “the Information Commissioner’s Transparency Policy: Disclosing Information about Specific Individuals and Organisations”. This reflected the practise that disputed information would not be disclosed until a final determination either by the Commissioner himself or this Tribunal. 41. Finally, it was submitted that the effect of upholding this appeal would be to declare the HPC beyond review with regard to certain aspects of its FOIA duties. The Commissioner would be obliged to accept the assertions of the HPC as to the correctness of exemptions claimed and would not be able to verify for himself. In this way the statutory scheme and the Commissioner’s role would be significantly undermined. 13Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: Conclusion 42. The Tribunal noted at the outset that the Information Notice itself did not adequately make clear the matters that the Commissioner had taken into account or the reasons for the need for the Notice. As such it had been necessary to look at the correspondence leading up to the decision to issue the Notice. Inevitably, the letters in question were not as tightly written as a formal document. The Tribunal gave a broad construction of the letter of 31st August 2007 (set out at paragraph 30 above) and concluded that the Information Commissioner had indeed taken into account the alleged damage to the Process. This included the purported damage to the Process that would follow from both disclosure to the Information Commissioner himself and possible onwards transmission to the public. The impugned wording in that letter (underlined and set out in paragraph 30 above) were, in the Tribunal’s view, an indication that he had taken the purported damage into account and represented his conclusions why nevertheless the Notice needed to be issued. 43. The Tribunal recommended that in future cases the Information Commissioner set out in greater detail, as he does for Decision Notices, the matters taken into account and the reasons for the decisions taken. 44. The Tribunal did not accept the HPC’s argument that the Commissioner should have considered asking for just some of the disputed information as it was self evidently the case that he would not know what to call for without having sight of the documents themselves. 45. With regard to section 59 DPA the Tribunal was of the view that the extent to which it protected information in the hands of the Information Commissioner from onwards disclosure could not be said to be coterminus with the restrictions on disclosure that arose from the duty of confidentiality on the HPC. Thus it was accepted that there could potentially be circumstances in which the Information Commissioner would make onwards disclosure against the wishes of the HPC or the author of that information (registrant, third party witnesses etc.) This was however unlikely to happen given that the protection afforded by section 59 was extensive and in some respects broader than a duty of confidentiality – thus section 59 applies to all 14Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: information obtained by the Information Commissioner, not just that which has the quality of confidence. In addition to this, it was noted that the exemptions claimed by the HPC would in all likelihood apply to the Information Commissioner himself. In this regard, the Tribunal noted that the examples given of information which registrants would not want disclosed all fell within the personal data exemption. 46. Most importantly however, the Tribunal reminded itself of the Commissioner’s responsibilities with regard to the protection of data and privacy, such that preserving the information’s confidentiality was likely to be an overriding consideration at least until he had made a decision and the conclusion of any appeal. 47. It was accepted by the Tribunal that disclosure to the Information Commissioner might cause a degree of future reticence on the part of registrants in providing information. On testing the evidence, the Tribunal concluded however, that the damage to the Process anticipated by the HPC would not be as significant as feared. Registrants had a self-interest in disclosing a broad range of information at the early stage – this was, after all, the best way to keep the matter out of the public domain (i.e.: by virtue of a no case to answer finding). The Tribunal considered that the HPC was overstating the confidentiality expected by registrants. Not all registrants received the assurances as to confidentiality and even then, the content of their observations were subject to partial disclosure to complainants. The Tribunal noted moreover that registrants were unaware of the fact that HPC on occasion made disclosures in the public interest e.g.: child protection and police matters. The reality was that the ‘aura’ of confidence, as Counsel for the HPC put it, attached to the information provided by registrants, was not as clear or as bright as contended. 48. The Tribunal was of the view that the HPC would be able to revise its procedures to ensure that those providing information were accurately forewarned that the HPC’s dealing with this information would be subject to its duties under FOIA and the DPA. If registrants enquired further they could be provided with a number of reassurances: 15Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: a. that the Information Commissioner has responsibility for data protection and privacy and is very likely therefore to be required under the DPA to treat the confidential nature of personal data as an overriding factor; b. that the exemptions that apply to the HPC would also apply to the Information Commissioner under any request made to it under FOIA; c. that the Information Commissioner’s office is subject to a criminal prohibition against disclosure; d. as to its Transparency Policy (setting out the information which the Information Commissioner would not normally disclose, including disputed information in the course of an investigation or leading up to an appeal) e. generally its practices with regard to ensuring the security and confidentiality of information. 49. At paragraph 45 of the FOE decision, a differently constituted Tribunal stated: “Finally, [it was] contended that……………… public authorities should now have fundamentally different expectations in respect of the manner in which their information is liable to be treated.” The Tribunal considered these words particularly apposite to the current case and the HPC’s approach to its FOIA responsibilities. 50. Counsel to the Information Commissioner drew the Tribunal’s attention to the Memorandum of Understanding that exists between the Information Commissioner and the Ministry of Justice. This includes a number of undertakings as to the way in which information will be dealt with by the Information Commissioner. The Tribunal considered whether undertakings such as these, since it was told these represent normal practise, could be of reassurance to the HPC and its registrants. The Tribunal recommends that the Information Commissioner considers either entering into such an MOU with the HPC or as an alternative the drawing up of a policy or protocol on the provision of information to the Commissioner applicable to all public authorities. Whilst the Transparency Policy goes someway in this direction, it does 16Appeal NumberEA/2007/0116: not deal fully with the way in which information obtained by the Commissioner in the normal course of his duties or under an Information Notice will be handled. 51. The Tribunal would have welcomed more assistance from the Information Commissioner in the way in which this case was defended (for instance, Counsel for the Information Commissioner could have usefully cross-examined the witnesses). It understood the Commissioner’s position that even at its highest the alleged damage to the Process would not outweigh the public importance of his role in reviewing compliance with FOIA duties and the need therefore to see the information. The Tribunal had sympathy for this position but considered it important to assist the HPC’s understanding of certain misplaced aspects of its case. It hoped that through the appeal process the HPC had realised that some of its procedures needed revising and that the alleged damage to the Process was not as bad as anticipated and finally, may be avoided with suitable explanations to registrants. 52. The Tribunal concurred that in most circumstances the Information Commissioner would need to see the disputed information and that it would be a very high hurdle to clear to convince a Tribunal that the Information Commissioner could and should carry out his functions without sight of the relevant material. This case came nowhere near that mark. The Tribunal was of the view that the public interest in the Information Commissioner being able to carry out his regulatory function in the way intended by Parliament was so important as to outweigh any negative impact from disclosure under the Information Notice. Thus, it considered that the Information Commissioner had exercised his discretion correctly and, for the reasons given above, that the Notice had been in accordance with law. 53.

"2121","EIR","Information Tribunal Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 Information Commissioner’s Ref: FS50088298 Heard at Procession House, London, EC4 Decision Promulgated On 17 and 18 December 2007 30 January 2008 BEFORE CHAIRMAN CHRIS RYAN and LAY MEMBERS PAUL TAYLOR ANNE CHAFER BETWEEN: British Union for Abolition of Vivisection Appellant And The Information Commissioner Respondent Secretary of State for the Home Department Additional Party Representation: For the Appellant: Daniel Alexander QC For the Respondent: Akhlaq Choudhury For the Additional Party: Karen Steyn 1Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 Decision The Tribunal allows the appeal in part and directs the Home Office to reconsider its assessment of the disputed information, in the light of the Tribunal’s interpretation of section 44 of the Freedom of Information Act, (when read in conjunction with section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986), and its guidance as to the appropriate procedures to follow under those provisions. The Tribunal further directs that, once that reconsideration has taken place, the application of section 44 of the Freedom of Information Act to any of the disputed information that continues to be withheld at that stage be considered at a further hearing. That further hearing will also determine the possible application of the other exemptions relied on by the Home Office, namely those arising under sections 21, 38, 40, 41 and 43 of the Freedom of Information Act. 2Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 Reasons for Decision Introduction 1. This is part of an Appeal brought by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (“BUAV”) against a refusal by the Information Commissioner to order the Home Office to disclose certain information about five animal experimentation licences. The Home Office had refused to communicate the information sought on the grounds that it was subject to several of the exemptions provided for in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). The Information Commissioner decided that the disputed information should not be released because one of those exemptions applied, namely Section 44 (disclosure prohibited under statute). He considered that it was not therefore necessary to consider whether any of the other exemptions also applied. This decision deals with just the section 44 issue and leaves the possible impact of the other exemptions to be determined at a later hearing. Reaching a decision has required us to balance the Home Office’s wish to protect from publication information which it believes was passed to it in confidence against the wish of the BUAV to be provided with the information which it requires to satisfy itself that animal experimentation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (“ASPA”) is being regulated with what it considers to be appropriate rigour. 2. This decision is being issued approximately three years after the date of the original request for information on which it is based. The second part of the Appeal will inevitably be determined some time after that anniversary. The Tribunal’s own decision to deal with the Appeal in two separate hearings has unfortunately contributed to the overall delay in reaching a conclusion but it is extremely unfortunate that the process for dealing with the request within the Home Office took eight weeks, the internal review of that refusal a further five months and the Information Commissioner’s investigation of the BUAV’s complaint a further twenty one months. Even allowing for the difficulties which the Information Commissioner’s office faced during the early months of the operation of the FOIA we have to record our disappointment that the first letter from the Information Commissioner to the Home Office notifying it that a complaint had been received 3Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 was not sent until almost a year after the complaint had been submitted, and his detailed investigation did not begin until a further 4 months had expired. The request for information 3. On 17 January 2005 the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division of the Home Office received a FOIA request from the BUAV, dated 12 January 2005. It referred to a number of abstracts of project licences granted under section 5 of ASPA which had been published on the Home Office website. The request then read: “The Home Office does of course hold the project licences themselves. I would be grateful if you could let me have the actual information contained in each of the following licences (using the titles given in the abstracts): • Wound healing • Relief from chronic pain by use of antidepressants • Studying disorders of balance • Metabolism and excretion studies for new candidate drugs • Genetically modified animals and Respiratory Diseases” 4. On 15 March 2005 Dr Jon Richmond, then, as now, the Head of the Animals Scientific Procedures Division, wrote to the BUAV in response to its request for information. He set out in a schedule to his letter additional information on each project, which had not been included in the corresponding abstract. The letter explained that, beyond that information, the Home Office considered that a number of the exemptions set out in the FOIA applied to the licences and that disclosure of additional information was therefore refused. The exemptions relied on were section 21 (information accessible by other means), section 38 (health and safety), section 40 (personal information), section 41 (information provided in confidence), section 43 (commercial interests) and section 44 (prohibition on disclosure). The essence of that response was maintained when, following a request for internal review, Mr Stephen Sowerby of the Home Office Information Policy Team wrote to the BUAV on 10 August 2005. However, Mr Sowerby did agree at that stage that 4Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 some of the conditions attached by the Home Office to one of the licences should also be disclosed. In all other respects the request was refused. 5. The background to the request is that the Home Office has responsibility for advising the Secretary of State on, among other matters, the grant or refusal of licences under ASPA permitting the use of animals for experimental or other scientific procedures that may have the effect of causing the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. Before any such procedure may be carried out the individual or organisation planning it must disclose fully the overall aim of the programme, a detailed plan of the work proposed, the specific scientific objectives, how they will be achieved, the species (and number) of animals to be used, the procedures to be applied to them and the adverse effects, severity limits, and ultimate fate of the animals. This disclosure is recorded in an application for a project licence, which must also demonstrate: a. that there are no scientifically suitable alternatives that might replace animal use, reduce the number of animals subjected to the procedure or enable it to be conducted in a manner that causes less suffering; and b. the likely benefits (to humans, other animals or the environment) that must be weighed against the likely welfare costs to the animals involved. If an application is successful the licence granted takes the form of a covering letter to which the application form is attached as a schedule. The covering letter stipulates that the licence grants authority for the work specified in the schedule. It may also provide that the licence is subject to other conditions which the Home Office may impose. These comprise a set of standard conditions and in some cases additional specific conditions are also applied. The BUAV request therefore applied to the “actual information” set out in each of the application forms that led to the grant of the five licences which it identified. 6. In December 2004, shortly before the FOIA came into force, the Home Office wrote to licence holders proposing that anonymised abstracts of granted project licences should in future be published on the Home Office website. We were told that this reflected the publicly stated wishes of Ministers to be as open as possible in order to foster informed debate about the use of animals in science. The letter went on to 5Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 explain that the Home Office had worked with a number of licence holders in preparing abstracts that, upon publication, might serve as examples for others to follow in the future. In evidence before us it was explained that this work had taken the form of a workshop exercise in which certain licence holders and Home Office officials had co-operated in an attempt to balance freedom of information considerations against the wishes of the scientific community to apply legitimate restrictions on disclosure of sensitive material. The perceived sensitivity arose from a concern that the release of information might enable animal right extremists to target individuals or premises where experimentation was being conducted as well as a wish to protect commercial or scientific secrets from competitors. Following that exercise all those applying for a licence have been asked to include an abstract with their application form, but they have not been forced to do so and a few have declined. The abstracts that are provided are then published on the Home Office website. 7. The five abstracts referred to in the BUAV request were among the first nine abstracts to be published in this way and all resulted from the workshop exercise, although we were told in evidence that the final form in each case was determined by the licence applicant without Home Office involvement. In each case the abstract did not name the applicant or identify the premises at which the licensed processes were intended to be performed. It bore a title that was different from the title of the project identified on the application form; it was expressed in less scientific language and was in most cases less specific. It then set out, in narrative form, a summary of the applicant’s previous work which had led it to propose the project in question, the purpose of that project and the experimental procedures that it intended to carry out. The information summarised in this way appears in the application form in a total of twenty sections, each one responding to prompts or questions on the printed form about a particular element of the application. The sections towards the front of the form relate to the identity and experience of those who it is proposed will carry out the project and the premises at which the work will be conducted. Three key sections then follow. Part 17 of the application form calls for detailed information on the background of the proposed work and the objectives that it is hoped to achieve. The scientific literature supporting the responses given is also to be listed. Part 18 then calls for a plan of the proposed work, summarising 6Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 each experiment and the sequence in which experiments are to be performed, if there is more than one, and the links between them. Section 19 then requires the applicant to provide a description of the protocol to be followed on each experiment including information on the animals to be used. This is required to specify, where appropriate, both the species and the precise type of animal which, as a result of either a breeding programme or genetic intervention, possesses characteristics that make it suitable for the intended experiments. 8. We comment in more detail on the detailed information set out in the Licence applications in the confidential schedule to this Decision referred to below. We only add, in this open part of our Decision, that the abstracts appear generally to adopt a style and tone intended to persuade the reader as to the value of the proposed experiments. This is in contrast to the style of the licence applications, which are more neutral in tone. This perception of a positive spin having been applied to the published information was increased by the absence from the abstracts of the detail about the experiments themselves. The continuous narrative form of an abstract also made it more difficult for us to correlate particular passages to the equivalent information provided, in more structured form, in the Licence application to which it related. We return to this point in paragraph 32 (b) below. The complaint to the Information Commissioner 9. On 6 September 2005 BUAV complained to the Information Commissioner about the manner in which the Home Office had handled its request for information. In his Decision Notice issued of 12 June 2007 the Information Commissioner decided that the Home Office had reasonable grounds for believing that the information contained in each licence, not already published in an abstract, had been provided by the applicant with an expectation of confidentiality. He considered that this brought into play section 24(1) of ASPA, which reads as follows: “A person is guilty of an offence if otherwise than for the purposes of discharging his functions under this Act he discloses any information which has been obtained by him in the exercise of those functions and which he knows or has reasonable grounds for believing to have been given in confidence” 7Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 The Information Commissioner concluded that the information had been obtained in the exercise of the Home Office’s function under ASPA, that disclosure to BUAV would not represent the discharge of any such function and that it knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that it had been provided in confidence. He considered that section 24 would therefore apply to the disclosure of the information requested by BUAV and that this in turn triggered the application of the absolute exemption set out in FOIA section 44. The relevant part of that section reads: “(1) Information is exempt information if its disclosure (otherwise than under this Act) by the public authority holding it – (a) is prohibited by or under any enactment” In the course of reaching that decision the Information Commissioner recorded that the additional information disclosed under cover of the letters from Dr Richmond and Mr Sowerby referred to in paragraph 4 had not been considered by the Home Office to be confidential as it was general in nature and limited to certain facts that it did not consider were covered by the exemption. The Information Commissioner concluded that, as all the rest of the requested information was covered by section 44, there was no need for him to investigate whether any of the other exemptions on which the Home Office relied were also engaged. The appeal to the Tribunal 10. On 5 July 2007 BUAV launched an appeal to this Tribunal under FOIA section 57. The Grounds of Appeal challenged the Information Commissioner’s conclusion that the information in dispute fell within section 24 of ASPA and that the Home Office had fulfilled its obligations under FOIA by making the abstracts available to the public and disclosing to BUAV the additional information referred to above. Under section 58 FOIA the Tribunal is required to determine whether the Decision Notice is in accordance with the law and, in doing so it may review any finding of fact on which it was based. 11. An Order was made joining the Home Office as a party to the Appeal on 3 September 2007 and directions were given, following a pre hearing review, on 12 September 2007. The Appeal proceeded to a hearing on 17 and 18 December 8Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 2007 on the basis that only the section 44 FOIA exemption would be dealt with. The Tribunal considered that, if it were to find that the section 44 exemption did not apply to all or some of the information in dispute, and it became necessary to consider the other exemptions not covered by the Decision Notice, further enquiries might be needed to be directed before it could determine those issues. Witness statements were provided by Ms Michelle Thew on behalf of the BUAV and Dr J Richmond, on behalf of the Home Office. Both witnesses were cross examined during the hearing. In the case of Dr Richmond part of that cross examination took place during a closed session, which enabled the Tribunal panel to ask questions about the detailed content of the Licence applications without putting confidentiality at risk before a decision had been made on the point. The questions for the Tribunal 12. The section 44 exemption will obviously not apply unless the withheld information falls within section 24 ASPA. There is no dispute that the information contained in the licences was obtained by the Home Office in the exercise of its functions under ASPA and that disclosure of the withheld information would not be for the purposes of discharging its functions under that statute. However there is disagreement on whether the confidentiality requirement in section 24 is satisfied. The BUAV argues that the only information protected by the section is information whose disclosure would constitute the tort of breach of confidence. It is common ground that, if that is correct, the following three part test, (derived from the leading case of Coco v AN Clark [1969] RPC 41), must be applied: a. Does the information in question have the necessary quality of confidence? b. If so, was it disclosed in circumstances that gave rise to an obligation to maintain its confidentiality? c. Would its disclosure in breach of that obligation cause harm to the person who made the original, confidential, disclosure However the Home Office and the Information Commissioner say that this is not the appropriate test to apply. They argue that the words “…knows or has reasonable grounds for believing to have been given in confidence” in section 24 ASPA import 9Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 only the second of the Coco v Clark tests and that there is no need to establish that the information was at the time inherently worthy of protection or that its disclosure would in fact cause harm to the provider. They also argue that if, contrary to their primary argument, it is necessary for all three elements of the Coco v Clark test to be satisfied, then the withheld information still falls within the section 24 prohibition because it does have the necessary quality of confidence and its disclosure would cause harm to the licence holders. 13. It is common ground between the parties that, if section 24 does import the law on breach of confidence, we must consider whether any claim under that law could be met with an argument that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information in question. This is because there is a well established public interest defence available to those facing a claim for breach of confidence. It is similar, but not identical, to the public interest balance that must be applied under FOIA section 2(2)(b) once a qualified exemption has been found to apply to particular information. In that case there is a presumption in favour of disclosure, whereas in the case of a breach of confidence claim the presumption is in favour of protecting an individual’s confidential information. 14. We will deal with each of those arguments in turn. Does section 24 ASPA import the law on breach of confidence? 15. The Home Office invited us to contrast the language of section 24 (“…reasonable grounds for believing to have been given in confidence”) with the language of FOIA section 41 (“…disclosure… would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by…”) and to conclude that when Parliament wished to include a requirement of an actionable breach of confidence it said so in clear terms. It argued that this demonstrates that it was not Parliament’s intention to require a prosecutor under ASPA to establish an actionable duty of confidence. It said that, if it had, some of the information which an applicant was required to disclose from, for example, an early stage of a research programme, might be too imprecise for it to form the basis for a successful prosecution, given the standard of proof that would be applied in those circumstances. The requirement to prove detriment would also create further 10Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 difficulty for the prosecutor, which it said had not been the intention of the legislation. Against that the BUAV’s case was that Parliament’s clear intention when enacting section 24 ASPA had been to incorporate the law of confidence (including all of the Coco v Clark tests) and that, if this was not the case, it would be possible for an applicant for a licence simply to assert that all of the information in its application form was confidential and, in that way, effectively avoid disclosure by the Home Office under FOIA. 16. On this issue we prefer the BUAV’s arguments. We think that, even though section 24 ASPA does not make specific reference to the law of confidence, the use of the phrase “given in confidence” means that the information in question was entitled to protection under that law – it means that it was given in circumstances where, because of the nature of the information, the circumstances of the disclosure and the harm likely to result from disclosure, the person receiving the licence application had a legally enforceable obligation to keep it confidential. The effect of the Home Office’s argument would be that the threshold for criminal liability in this area would be lower than that for civil liability. That would be a remarkable outcome and we do not believe that it can be right. 17. The importing of the law of confidence in this way has the advantage that it provides a set of well established rules, based on case law, to be applied by a public authority when assessing information. We think that this is greatly preferable to the alternative, under which the test to be applied by the public authority would be very imprecise. The problems likely to be faced by a public authority in those circumstances are highlighted by the inconsistency we see between the interpretation which the Home Office has urged us to apply and the manner in which it has itself treated the BUAV request. If it were right that the only test to be applied was whether the information had been passed to the Home Office in circumstances that were capable of giving rise to an obligation of confidence, then it would not be necessary, or appropriate, for it to make any separation between disclosable and non-disclosable information. Yet that is what it has done in conceding that not all the information contained in the licence applications may be withheld. In releasing additional information, in the circumstances described in 11Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 paragraph 4 above it has evidently applied criteria based on the nature of the information and not just the circumstances on which it was disclosed to it. 18. Our interpretation of section 24 is supported by its legislative history. In the course of the House of Lords’ consideration of a particular amendment to the clause that became section 24, Viscount Davidson, the Home Office minister responsible for the passage of the bill through the House of Lords said this: “This is not a provision which is intended to apply to every word uttered, every fact acquired. People will of course be expected to behave with decorum and a due sense of discretion. But only when information is given on a specific in- confidence basis will the rigours of Clause 24 be relevant…” We believe that this demonstrates that the first two elements of the Coco v Clark test were intended to be incorporated. In a subsequent passage Viscount Davidson effectively reinforced the applicability of the first test (quality of confidence) and asserted that the third test (detriment) would also apply when he said: “…the major concern, and the one which promoted inclusion of the clause in the Bill, is that commercially valuable material will be obtained by rival organisations or individuals…” 19. It follows from our conclusion on this point that the Home Office, on receiving the request for information about the licence applications, should have withheld from disclosure only those elements of the information it contained which were protected by the law of confidence. We think that the circumstances in which the information had been provided to the Home Office were clearly capable of giving rise to an obligation of confidence, so that the second element of the Coco v Clark test was clearly satisfied. As to the third element we think that it will almost certainly follow in cases of this type that the disclosure of information from a licence application which satisfies the first element will constitute a commercial or technical secret the disclosure of which would cause the applicant harm. The Home Office would therefore have been entitled to concentrate principally, if not solely, on establishing whether any of the withheld information possessed the necessary quality of confidence. 12Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 20. We are aware of the practical consequences that follow from our decision on this point. In future cases the scientifically qualified personnel within the Home Office are likely to be able to review the relevant material more quickly than we were able to do, even though we had the assistance of Dr Richmond, but the time taken might well be extended if the licence applicant’s own assertions as to confidentiality have to be evaluated. This may create particular problems, as Dr Richmond explained to us, in responding to a request for information within the 20 working day limit imposed on public authorities by FOIA section 10(1). We have a great deal of sympathy for any public authority which is placed in the position of having to take a decision, which could lead to criminal liability if wrong, against a tight timetable. However, this is not a reason which we feel requires us to depart from the conclusion we have reached as to the correct interpretation of section 24 ASPA. The impact of the argument was, in any event, lessened on the facts of this Appeal, by the time taken to respond to the original request and to carry out the subsequent review of the original refusal. Is the withheld information in fact entitled to protection under the law of confidence? 21. We have not been able to reach a final determination on which specific elements of the withheld information, if any, constitute confidential information, judged against the criteria set out in paragraphs 15 to 19 above. Although we spent some considerable time reviewing the licence applications in question and trying to compare the information they contained with the information disclosed in the abstracts, this did not enable us to differentiate all elements of information that were protected by the law of confidence at the time when the Home Office refused disclosure from those that were not. However, we are able to say that the Home Office did not, in our view, carry out the required level of review in this case. We base that conclusion on two factors. 22. First, we found a number of examples of specific information which do not appear in the abstracts but did not appear to be confidential information, applying the test required by the law of confidence. We identified these, as examples and not by any means as an exhaustive list, on the basis of our questioning of Dr Richmond in closed session during the hearing. Accordingly, a detailed explanation of them is set out in a confidential schedule to this decision. The schedule is to remain 13Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 confidential until this Appeal has been concluded and either the time for launching an appeal against it has expired or, in the event that an appeal is launched, the appeal has been abandoned or determined. 23. The second factor on which we base this part of our decision is the process which the Home Office carried out when responding to the original request, as explained to us in its own evidence. As stated above some of its staff had reviewed each of the licence applications in question with the applicants in the course of workshop sessions. These had the entirely laudable aim of helping all applicants to accept that the blanket confidentiality restriction which had existed in the past would not apply in future and that a balance would have to be struck between the public disclosure of information on animal experiments and legitimate control of commercial secrets. We accept the evidence of Dr Richmond that the Home Office supports freedom of information principles in this area and that it has tried hard to strike an appropriate balance with applicants, both in the course of workshops before the FOIA came into force and in its dealings with applicants since. However, we do not accept that the disclosure of just the information which the applicants themselves decided should be included in the published abstracts involved in this Appeal (albeit influenced by their discussions with Home Office officials during the workshop) satisfied the obligations imposed on a public authority by the FOIA. 24. As it applies to the facts of this case FOIA Section 1(1)(b) required the Home Office to disclose information unless permitted to withhold it under section 2(2)(a), on the ground that it was covered by the absolute exemption set out in section 44. The interplay of those provisions imposed on it an obligation to consider which elements of the information set out in each licence application were protected from disclosure by an obligation of confidence. 25. We are not satisfied that this exercise was carried out with appropriate rigour, even though it did lead to some further information being disclosed by Dr Richmond and Mr Sowerby in the course of considering the BUAV’s original request. During cross examination Dr Richmond explained that the Home Office considered that it had acquired sufficient information from its co-operation with the licence applicants during the workshop sessions to enable it to judge their likely attitude to particular 14Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 elements of information. For this reason, and because of the time constraint imposed by the 20 working day time limit, it did not seek the views of individual applicants on what information each considered to be confidential, let alone challenge any claim to confidentiality that may have been asserted. Although the general attitude of Dr Richmond and his staff was therefore consistent with freedom of information principles we do not think that the procedure it followed in assessing whether the information in dispute should have been disclosed was in accordance with the FOIA. 26. We therefore conclude that not all of the withheld information is protected by an obligation of confidence owed to the licence applicants. We set out in paragraph 30 below what steps require to be taken to remedy the position, in consequence of that decision and our decision on the availability of a public interest defence. Would a public interest defence be available to defeat a claim for breach of confidence? 27. A defendant in a claim for breach of confidence may be able to rely on a public interest defence. This has been established in the case law on breach of confidence and reinforced by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as applied by the Court of Appeal in London Regional Transport v The Mayor of London [2001] EWCA Civ 1491. The existence of such a defence was not challenged before us but we heard argument as to whether the facts would have supported such a defence. The BUAV has an obvious interest in monitoring the conduct of animal research and the way in which the Home Office regulates that activity. It considers that as much information about animal experiments should be in the public domain as possible, particularly in relation to the procedures to which animals are exposed, the benefit that may be said to be derived from those procedures and the availability of non-animal alternatives. 28. The Home Office recognises that the public has a legitimate interest in animal experimentation and the regulatory system applied to it under ASPA. However, it has argued before us that these considerations did not outweigh the public interest in maintaining confidentiality. It relied, in particular, on: 15Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 a. The risk of animal right extremists identifying individuals or establishments involved in the experimentation proposed in a licence application and targeting them for harassment or physical harm. It was not suggested that the BUAV had anything to do with this type of activity. The fact that it is relied on in support of the Home Office’s refusal to disclose information is an eloquent indication of the harm that it is capable of doing to the objectives of legitimate campaigning groups. However, it is well established that disclosure to one FOIA requestor operates as disclosure to the world and, although the BUAV sought to persuade us that illegal activities against those involved in animal experiments is not as extensive or serious as the media may suggest, we are satisfied that it is a material factor that we should take into account. The BUAV has made it clear that it does not require the names of either individuals or premises but the Home Office argued that the disclosure of more technical information than appears in the abstracts will enable them to be quite easily identified. Dr Richmond explained in his evidence that an internet search using a standard public search engine, and having the full title of the licence as its search term (as opposed to the simplified title of the corresponding abstract), in most cases listed the applicant among the first ten “hits” it identified. He also explained that disclosure of the bibliography incorporated into the licence application in support of the proposed experimentation would also enable the individuals involved to be identified because, not surprisingly, a proposal frequently develops from earlier research, with the result that those involved with the proposal also feature largely among the authors identified in the bibliography. We think that this demonstrates that it is already relatively easy to identify, from publicly available information, the individuals and organisations that are prominent in a particular area of research and have used animals in experiments in the past. We are not convinced that the disclosure of the bibliography or the full title of the licence application will therefore increase significantly the risk that those working in this area face from extremists. We think that there is even less risk likely to arise from the disclosure of 16Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 information about the purposes, processes and impact on animals involved in a particular programme of experiments beyond that set out in the abstracts. However, we can only be certain on that point when we see the exact content of any additional information that is found to fall outside the section 24 prohibition, following the review that we have directed the Home Office to undertake under paragraph 30 below. b. The risk of commercial or technical information being made available to competitors, thereby denying the licence applicant of a legitimate advantage generated by its own research efforts. We believe that the need to protect an applicant from this type of potential damage is a powerful reason for withholding information. We can say, without disclosing confidential elements of information, that Dr Richmond explained how information on matters that might appear to be relatively anodyne, such as the specific type of animal to be used or the precise sequence of proposed experiments, might well be of great value to a competitor, particularly when linked with one another and with a general description of a programme’s overall purpose. However, it is not possible to make a public interest judgment on the basis of generalisation. It is necessary to consider each specific piece of information that is claimed or found to be confidential. The harm the applicant is likely to suffer by disclosure must then be weighed against the contribution disclosure may make to the public debate on particular aspects of either the proposed experimentation or the manner in which it is being regulated. Although, therefore, there would need to be powerful reasons for concluding that the applicant’s right to confidentiality in respect of this type of information should be overridden by public interest in disclosure, it is not possible to reach a final determination on the point until the exercise outlined in paragraph 30 below has been completed. c. Disclosure might lead research organisations to move their operations to a country where confidential information was more securely protected. 17Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 The Home Office suggested that two consequences might flow from this. First, a detrimental effect on the UK science base, which is considered vital for its future economic progress. Secondly, animal experimentation may thereafter be conducted in countries with a lower animal welfare standard. While we do not dismiss either of these possibilities, we believe that they should carry significantly less weight than those already considered, when the detailed analysis comes to be performed. Some practical consequences of our decision. 29. We do not underestimate the burden of work that is likely to fall on the Home Office when applying our interpretation of section 24 ASPA to the information in dispute in this case or to any future requests for information on licences granted under ASPA. In the course of the hearing we spent over half a day reviewing, in closed session with Dr Richmond, the licence applications involved in this Appeal, two of them in some detail. In that time we were able to obtain sufficient understanding of the subject matter to enable us to reach our conclusion that the Home Office had not complied with FOIA section 1 in response to the BUAV request. However, it would have taken a great deal more time for every element of potentially confidential information to be identified, its true status to be established and the possible application of a public interest defence to be determined. It may be tempting, in those circumstances, to apply a broad categorisation to the content of a licence application, and to proceed on the basis, for example, that all experimental protocols are confidential. However, we do not believe that this would justify departing from our clear conclusion as to the effect of section 24 ASPA and section 44 FOIA. The information must be examined, in the same way that it would be in a civil claim for breach of confidence, and its status determined, element by element. 30. We accordingly direct that the Home Office re-examine the information in dispute and identify which specific elements of each licence application would have been protected by the law of confidence, as encapsulated in the Coco v Clark test, at the date of the original refusal to disclose. The timetable for this exercise, and for the next stages of the Appeal, will be determined in a further pre hearing review to be fixed as soon as possible after the date on which this Decision is promulgated. We 18Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 envisage that the directions to be made at that stage will provide that, once the results of the Home Office re-examination have been made available to the Tribunal and the Information Commissioner (and, to the extent possible, the BUAV), a further hearing will be fixed at which all of the other exemptions originally raised by the Home Office will also be considered. 31. It is to be hoped that the conclusions we have reached on the interpretation of section 24 ASPA will reduce the need to spend time on either section 41 or section 43 of the FOIA and that our comments on the risk to individuals, additional to that already caused by public domain material, will also enable the time to be spent on FOIA section 38 to be reduced. 32. We wish to make the following comments on procedural matters, which may be relevant to the next stage of this Appeal or to future appeals involving similar subject matter: a. It might have been possible to come closer to a decision on the application of the exemption to the facts of this case if some or all of the BUAV’s legal team had been permitted to participate in the closed session, on appropriate terms as to confidentiality. Even then, it is conceivable that to be of real value the legal representatives would have required the assistance of their own technical expert, who would also have been subject to a confidentiality undertaking. This is a procedure that is not uncommon in litigation involving technical content and we think, with the benefit of hindsight, that it might have been of assistance in this case, although it would certainly have added to the length, complexity and cost of the Appeal. We think that it is a procedure that is at least worth considering if similar circumstances arise on future appeals. b. It might also have assisted us if the licence applications had been disclosed to the BUAV in redacted form as it would then have been clearer exactly what information had been withheld, as well as its precise context. Dr Richmond’s witness statement, reaffirmed in answer to a question from the panel, was that an attempt to disclose material in redacted format under the voluntary scheme which existed under the Code of Practice on Access to 19Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 Government Information, before the FOIA came into force, had not been a success because it presented disjointed information. We respect Dr Richmond’s views, in light of his direct experience of the redaction process, and acknowledge that the FOIA does not, of course, impose on public authorities an obligation to disclose documents. The Statute applies to the information that the public authority holds and, apart from a detailed provision (in section 11) about the means by which such information may be communicated (which has no application to the facts of this Appeal) does not specify how information should be disclosed. We did not therefore accept the argument, which was put to us by Mr Alexander QC on behalf of BUAV, that a public authority does not discharge its duty under FOIA section 1(1)(b) by providing a summary of the information it holds. That is too broad a statement of the law. There may be occasions where a summary or other form of restating information will be sufficient to fulfil the public authority’s obligations. However Mr Alexander’s argument does gain strength from the particular facts of this case where the request was for the “actual information” contained in the licence applications, identified by reference to the published abstract of each. In our view this makes it more difficult to argue that a summary will be sufficient, but still does not rule out the possibility that it might be. Whether it is or not will depend on whether it is found, on review, to have the effect of communicating to the person who made the request, the essence of the information sought, after removing any that is protected by the law of confidence. What is important is therefore the effect of a purported disclosure, not its form. We nevertheless comment that, where the information requested must be extracted from a long and complex document containing both confidential and public domain information, the task of assessing the extent to which any exemption based on confidentiality may apply is likely to be made much easier if the original may be inspected in redacted form. It may be, of course, that the cost of providing information in this form will cause the cost limit imposed by FOIA section 12 to be exceeded. However that factor does not affect the obligation to disclose; it simply gives rise to the possibility of the obligation being overridden by the section 12 exception. 20Appeal Number: EA/2007/0059 c. There may be value in future in issuing a Joinder Notice against the organisations who submitted the licence applications under consideration. It is their claim to confidentiality that must be assessed (on our interpretation of the law) and having them make their own case on the issue may ultimately save time and costs even though it appears, at first glance, to complicate the procedure. Even if it did not simplify matters (for example, by enabling the public authority and the Information Commissioner to play a smaller role) the possible release of cutting edge scientific secrets, not to mention the risk to the public authority of civil or (in this case) criminal liability, may be sufficient justification for occasionally departing from the Tribunal’s normal stance of seeking to reduce procedural complications.
